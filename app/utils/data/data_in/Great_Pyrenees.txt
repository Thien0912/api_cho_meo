The Great Pyrenees is a lovable dog, making the breed an excellent family pet, bred as herding dogs in the Pyrenees mountains. They are large animals, with males getting well over 100 pounds. That fact alone is one red flag to keep in mind when considering bringing a Great Pyrenees home to your pet cats. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t raise them alongside felines. How your Great Pyrenees interacts with your cat largely depends on proper socialization and training between the two from an early age.

The answer to this question is that it depends on the individual dog and how they were raised. It is entirely possible for this breed to get along with cats, and anecdotally, many Great Pyrenees owners describe them as gentle giants, especially around felines. However, there are some arguments for when it wouldn’t be a good idea.
We have already mentioned this breed’s size. Even a puppy of this breed has the potential to hurt a cat during harmless play. Another factor to consider is the dog’s temperament, which is nurtured by the breed’s historic job as a livestock guardian. The Great Pyrenees may seem laid-back and easygoing. However, this pooch is alert to threats and can respond quickly if needed.
It is often their instinct to guard their herd against potential threats, and with cats being much smaller than the usual threats they would see, it’s unlikely they would consider them a significant threat. On the other hand, it is possible that they also consider your pet cats as their herd, meaning they could look out for them, too.
All in all, this is a hard question to answer and cannot be generalized. However, due to their size and temperament, it is safe to say that the two should always be supervised around each other if you do decide to house them together, and early socialization and training are crucial for success.
Undoubtedly, some dog owners may disagree with our assessment. We prefer to err on the side of caution in these matters. Let’s consider the breed’s temperament and how it may affect your dog’s relationship with your cat. The Great Pyrenees has been a livestock guardian for centuries. This job involved fending off predators, including bears and wolves.
This work has a lot of downtime but still requires awareness. They are staunch protectors of livestock, and they are gentle and tolerant of these animals. However, it’s the opposite case with anything or anyone who threatens the herd. These dogs are independent in a role that doesn’t need close supervision. They are also highly intelligent.
Many breeders still raise the Pyrenees for this job. They are working animals with a specific job and the instincts to fulfill this role. Remember that some personality traits become fixed in purebreds with years of selective breeding that encourages them. The breed also has a strong affection for their families and a protective nature. They can be on guard with strangers and not always accepting of other dogs, but this will greatly depend on their individual character, previous experiences, early socialization and living circumstances, with the amount of daily physical exercise and mental stimulation. Genetics can also play a role, but most dogs, if trained from an early age as puppies, can learn to live with cats and kittens safely, as long as there is a level of caution and supervision and no competition regarding resources.
If your Great Pyrinese had a negative previous experience with cats, it’s important to consider this before making any introductions to cats or kittens. Observe how your dog behaves and interacts with other animals, as this can say a lot about their personality and preferences. If your dog hasn’t been socialized with other animals, it’s best to take things slow and reconsider having a cat.

The Great Pyrenees excels as a family pet in households with older children. The dog will gladly share their affection with their humans and fend off threats and strangers. These instincts run deep in this breed. So, while many people say that these dogs are great with cats, there are factors that need to be considered in which they might not be the best fit. At the end of the day, though, much of how well your pets get along comes down to the individual pet, socialization, and training.

The Great Pyrenees is a majestic and ancient breed with roots tracing back thousands of years to the Pyrenees Mountains in Europe. Originally bred to guard livestock, their role as protectors required them to be vigilant, independent, and brave. They excelled at warding off predators like wolves and bears while maintaining a calm demeanor with the flock.
This breed boasts a dense, weather-resistant double coat, which can be white or include markings in shades like gray, tan, or badger. The coat is thick and fluffy, especially around the neck, giving them a lion-like appearance. Adult males typically stand 27-32 inches tall and weigh between 100-120 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. Their lifespan averages 10-12 years.
Apart from guarding livestock, these dogs have adapted to various roles, including search-and-rescue missions and therapy work, owing to their intelligence and steadfast loyalty.
The Great Pyrenees is known for its gentle and calm temperament, making it an excellent family dog. They are affectionate with their loved ones and have a patient demeanor, especially with children. Despite their loving nature, they retain a strong protective instinct, making them reliable watchdogs.
Their behavior can sometimes be marked by stubbornness, reflecting their independent decision-making as livestock guardians. While they are good with children and cats, proper socialization is essential to ensure harmonious relationships. They bark occasionally, usually to alert owners to potential threats, showcasing their vigilant nature.
Great Pyrenees are generally reserved with strangers but not aggressive unless provoked. Their protective nature makes them suitable as both guard and service dogs. They can be left alone for short durations but thrive with company. If left outside, they need a secure enclosure to prevent wandering.

Training a Great Pyrenees requires patience and consistency. Their independent streak can make training challenging, but positive reinforcement works well. Early socialization is crucial to curb any unwanted behaviors and to ensure they grow into well-rounded adults.
Shedding is high, particularly during seasonal changes, and regular grooming is essential. Weekly brushing helps manage their thick double coat, while baths can be less frequent unless they get dirty. Nail trimming, ear cleaning, and dental care are equally important for their overall health.
Great Pyrenees thrive in homes with ample space, such as houses with large backyards. While they can adapt to indoor living, they require regular outdoor time to satisfy their exercise needs. To prevent escapes, ensure fencing is high and secure, as these dogs can jump surprisingly well. Breeding pairs can share a home but should be monitored to prevent territorial disputes.
This breed is best suited to cooler climates, though they can adapt to warmer environments with proper care and shade. They coexist well with other dogs, especially breeds with a calm temperament like Golden Retrievers or Labradors.

When purchasing Great Pyrenees puppies, choose reputable breeders who provide health clearances for the parents. Look for puppies with bright eyes, clean ears, and a playful demeanor. Verify paperwork to ensure pedigree authenticity and health screenings.
Coat color in puppies may change subtly as they grow, so consult the breeder for guidance. Adoption is an excellent option, especially for adult dogs. Conduct a thorough health checkup and inquire about their temperament and history from the rescue center.
For those considering breeding, provide a nutritious diet and regular veterinary care for pregnant females. Puppies need a warm, secure environment with minimal handling in the initial weeks. Great Pyrenees are especially popular in countries like the USA, UK, and Australia, with prices ranging from $500 to $3,000 depending on pedigree and location.

The Great Pyrenees dog is a large breed that is both protective and loyal by nature. Lovingly referred to as the Pyrs, this dog has traditionally served as a sheep guardian.

The Great Pyrenees dog was developed as a working breed to help guard flocks of sheep from predators like bears and wolves in mountainous terrains. They are thought to be of Asian descent and first appeared in a recognizable fashion sometime between 1800 and 1000 B.C.1 They have been known as exceptional guards and watch dogs too. They would pull carts and do other labor tasks when necessary. They even transported contraband between Spain and France during World War I!

The typical Great Pyrenees puppy is loving, interactive, gentle, and tolerant. This is the time when they should be thoroughly socialized with other animals, kids, and adults. These dogs are instinctively protective of their family members, so puppies can be taught how to guard their homes without being a threat to household members or visitors to the property. They should start obedience training while still young; otherwise, they can be stubborn and hard to manage when fully grown.

This beautiful dog breed is confident and independent yet gentle and affectionate with their human (and animal!) companions. They also happen to be quite protective of their companions and territorial over what they perceive as their property. They were originally bred to protect sheep flocks with their lives, so it’s natural for them to want to do the same for their family members. They tend to have strong-willed personalities and can be both reserved and independent in certain situations. They are always attentive, they don’t give in to fear, and they are as loyal as they come.
The Great Pyrenees dog can be an excellent breed for families, provided that they are well-socialized and properly trained from the time that they are puppies. As adults, these dogs can accidentally injure children and small animals during playtime, so supervision is always recommended with small animals like Chihuahuas and cats and with kids until they are old and big enough to maintain control of the situation themselves and the dog understands basic obedience commands.
This breed can absolutely get along with other pets in the household. However, they should learn to enjoy the company of animal pals while they are puppies to ensure a happy, healthy, and cooperative life at home. If they grow up in a household with pets, they are likely to accept new ones as time goes on. Keep in mind that these dogs are instinctively protective, so if they are not well socialized, they may not get along with other animals, whether in public or in the household.

There are many specific things to know about before deciding whether a Great Pyrenees is the right pet for your household. Things like what to feed them, how much exercise to provide them with, whether training is important, and grooming requirements are likely on your mind as a potential owner. Here is what you should know before making a final ownership decision.
Although the Great Pyrenees is a large dog, they don’t eat much more food than the average-sized dog does. Of course, they might need more if they work on a farm or something similar due to so much energy exertion. These dogs love eating, though, and they are known to scarf their meals down in record time.
It’s a good idea to offer them a high-quality dry commercial food that is designed specifically for large breed dogs, as it’s formulated with the right number of vitamins and minerals necessary to promote proper and safe growth. Since this breed tends to eat quickly, they are susceptible to bloat. Therefore, it’s a good idea to serve their meals in a slow-feeder bowl, as this reduces the risk of bloat development.
Like all dogs, Great Pyrenees require daily exercise to stay happy and healthy throughout their lives. While these dogs are historically used to working hard, they spent most of their time lounging around when the flocks of sheep they looked after were not in danger. Therefore, they are not a highly active breed overall. They can benefit from 30-minute walks each day and time playing in the yard or the dog park a few days a week. They enjoy playing games indoors and are usually happy to play fetch, but owners shouldn’t be surprised if their pups “poop out” on them within just a few minutes.
Training is essential for the Great Pyrenees, if for no other reason than due to their size and tendency to be stubborn at times. Obedience training should start by the time that a Pyrs puppy is brought home for the first time. They should know how to come, sit, and stay at least by the time that they are about 6 months old. They should be well-versed in all things obedience when they are 1 year old. Watchdog and guard training can also be considered, as these dogs can excel at both.
These dogs have a large amount of fur, so you might think that they would shed excessively. However, this is not the case! Pyrs have coats that are resistant to tangling and that primarily shed during the spring months. This time is when their undercoat gets shed to make room for new fur, but the topcoat stays in place, so the shedding is not apparent (except for on flooring, bedding, clothing, and furniture in your home). Some people consider this shedding phase a “snowstorm.”
But other than dealing with the spring shedding season, these dogs don’t require much grooming. A weekly brushing should be all that it takes to keep their coats in good shape. Their ears should be cleaned out a few times a month using a wet cotton ball or washcloth, and their nails may need to be trimmed when they become long and sharp enough to injure themselves or others. Bathing is only necessary when the dog stinks or gets dirty while adventuring outdoors.
This large dog breed is generally healthy, but there are a few conditions that they can be susceptible to due to genetics or general environmental factors. Here are the serious and minor health conditions that the Pyrs could face and that every prospective and new owner should know about.
Most breeders have a deep commitment to the Great Pyrenees’s health. For example, the Great Pyrenees Club of America implores breeders to make testing a regular part of their practices to ensure that they do not perpetuate the act of breeding dogs with genetic disorders.
There is not a huge difference between male and female Great Pyrenees. Some say that males are more “needy” and harder to understand. However, there is no evidence to prove these anecdotes as fact. Both male and female Great Pyrenees are excellent guard dogs and can easily bond with a loving family when given the opportunity.

The Great Pyrenees are large and protective and will warn strangers away when they are not invited and when they seem threatening. However, they are not generally aggressive with proper guests to the home. They can be quite friendly and interactive in public settings too.
This dog breed is known for incessant barking. This habit is ingrained in them due to their livestock origins, so they bark in reaction to any unexpected noises that they hear. So, they might bark every time they hear someone walking down the sidewalk in front of the house, anytime a bird lands on the roof, or even when they hear crickets at night. Some Great Pyrenees bark more than others, so the amount of barking that any particular owner will experience will vary.
While large and often stoic, the Great Pyrenees can be goofy when they’re feeling playful and carefree. Engaging in gameplay with this breed can result in many silly antics and plenty of laughter and fun. From rolling around on the ground to scratch an itch to clownishly jumping for joy, this doggy breed is sure to help keep things lighthearted.

The Great Pyrenees is a fun-loving, intelligent, and loyal dog breed that can make a great family companion while protecting the family’s property. They do require training, socialization, and a firm yet loving hand to excel, but an experienced dog owner should be able to step up to the challenge.
