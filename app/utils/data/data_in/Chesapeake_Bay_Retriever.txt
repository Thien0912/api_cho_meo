The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a powerful, muscular dog. The head is broad with a medium stop. The muzzle is about the same length as the skull, tapering but not to a point. The wide-set eyes are yellowish to amber in color. The small ears are high set, hanging loosely. The teeth meet in a scissors or level bite. The lips are thin. The tail is medium in length, heavy at the base. Dewclaws on the back legs are usually removed and on the front legs may or may not be removed. The feet have webbed toes to aid in swimming. The oily, short coat is dense with a wave. The oils in the coat not only repel the water like a duck’s feathers do, but help the dog dry quickly, enabling the dog to swim in colder waters. Coat colors include brown, red, sedge or tan in the shade of dead grass. Sometimes there is a small white spot on the breast, belly, toes or back of the feet.
These are intelligent, brave and obedient dogs. They are trainable, willing and able to please, although they may be a little slow to learn. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are affectionate, loving, friendly and good with children. They have a passion for water, swimming and retrieving. This breed will get along with cats that are already living in your house, but may chase other cats. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is not recommended for an inexperienced new dog owner. The handler needs to be confident, exerting a natural authority over the dog. A firm, consistent, but kind approach is the most successful way to handle them. If possible, attend obedience classes with this breed. Proper canine to human communication is essential. The Chesapeake can be fairly dominant and will become willful and may develop dominance problems if it senses the owners are passive, meek or timid. Be sure to properly train and socialized them. Take your puppy out with you as much as possible and introduce it to other dogs so that it has a chance to feel relaxed with them. The Chesapeake tends to be more dominant than other retrievers. Without the proper leadership they can become territorial, aggressive, willful, reserved with strangers and may not get along with other dogs. Chessies are strong canines that require firm training and good management. Chesapeakes are usually slow to mature. With the right owners they are a joy to own.
Height: Males 23 - 26 inches (58 - 66 cm) Females 21 - 24 inches (53 - 61 cm)
Weight: Males 65 - 80 pounds (29 - 36 kg) Females 55 - 70 pounds (25 - 32 kg)
Prone to eye problems and hip dysplasia.
Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are not recommended for apartment life. They are relatively inactive indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers often enjoy sleeping outdoors if it is cooler outside, as they prefer cool climates.
About 10-12 years
About 7 to 10 puppies
The dense, harsh, short-haired coat is oily with a distinct smell and is easy to groom. Brush with a firm bristle brush to remove the dead hairs. While the Chesapeake needs the occasional bath to prevent any noticeable odor, they should not be bathed so often that the oily texture is stripped out. The oily coat helps protect the dog from icy waters. This breed is an average shedder.
In the winter of 1807, an English ship with two Newfoundlands on board wrecked off the coast of Maryland. Everyone was saved, and the two dogs were given to a family of dog lovers. They were later mated with local retrievers including English Otter Hounds, Flat-Coated Retrievers and Curly-Coated Retrievers. Careful breeding over the years has created an outstanding retriever with incredible enthusiasm and endurance. The dogs were used to hunt waterfowl in the rough and icy waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever has been known to retrieve hundreds of birds in a single day in frigid waters. This lively, enthusiastic hunter will come out of a river or marsh with only a few drops of water remaining on its oily coat, and these are quickly eliminated with a shake. Water rolls off the dog like a duck. Some of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever's talents include: tracking, hunting, retrieving, guarding, watchdog, Schutzhund, field spots and competitive obedience. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever was recognized by the AKC in 1878.

Drake the Chesapeake Bay Retriever—"His name is Drake and he comes from a fantastic pedigree. He LOVES the water and will even get in the bathtub if I fill it up for myself and leave it unattended for a split second. If there is a waterfall, river, lake, stream, moat, ditch, puddle or a rain drop he will find it and be in it. He is a classic puppy, getting into trouble yet does no wrong. He can be stubborn but is a fast learner. He is the younger (bigger) brother to my 5-pound Pomeranian, Kujo and they are (most of the time) best friends."

If you’re a fan of retriever breeds,  you’re likely familiar with popular breeds like the Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever. You may not be aware of their intelligent and energetic cousin, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, also known as the Chessie, by their enthusiasts. This versatile breed has a distinctive coat with a notable wave and an oily finish. Keep reading for more information about the charming Chessie.
Height:
21–26 inches
Weight:
55–80 pounds
Lifespan:
10–13 years
Colors:
Brown, dark brown, dark deadgrass, deadgrass, light brown, light deadgrass, sedge, tan
Suitable for:
Active families, hunters, and people interested in canine sports
Temperament:
Adaptable, intelligent, protective, energetic
The Chessie is an adaptable breed that falls into the retriever, gundog, and sporting dog categories. This is a complex breed, often showing greater emotional complexity than other gundog breeds. Because they were bred primarily for hunting waterfowl, the Chessie has a waterproof coat covered with natural oils that help maintain its waterproofing. This breed is the ideal hunting companion, but the Chessie can be tenacious and stubborn.

Although not an overly popular breed, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever has enthusiasts and breeders across the country, so you shouldn’t have much trouble getting a puppy. You may also find a puppy or adult dog through a breed-specific rescue or shelter.
When choosing a breeder, it’s extremely important that you choose one who performs all health testing recommended by the national breed club. There are multiple genetic conditions that this breed is susceptible to, but they can be mitigated through health testing.
Early socialization and training are both critical aspects of raising your pup. The stubbornness inherent in this breed can make training a challenge, especially if not started early, but this highly intelligent pup often aims to please, which may give you a training advantage. Positive reinforcement training and engaging training sessions are great tools for training a Chessie.
During the 1800s, duck hunters along the Chesapeake Bay were finalizing the breed that would go on to become the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. When the AKC was founded in 1884, a standardized breed had been established, with regional names including the Brown Winchester and Red Chester. Because of the frigid temperatures of the Chesapeake Bay, it was essential for the breed to be developed to withstand the harsh environment. The oily coat of the Chessie waterproofs and insulates them, while their webbed toes and broad shoulders make them strong swimmers.

The Chessie is not only a smart dog but also an emotionally intelligent dog. They do an excellent job of picking up on the emotions of their people and then providing comfort, which makes them a good option for therapy work. Although they are sometimes standoffish with strangers, early training and socialization can reduce the likelihood of this trait, and they are likely to be protective of their people.
As a highly adaptable breed, the Chessie can perform various jobs outside of retrieving, including search and rescue, drug and bomb detection, and canine sports.
Although loyal and sensitive, the Chessie isn’t always the ideal pet for homes with small children. They are typically gentle and sweet with children but may be intolerant of smaller kids. They are sensitive and affectionate with their people but are also protective and may be uninterested or suspicious of strangers. Early socialization will provide your Chessie with confidence and trust, setting them up to be the best companion for your family. With proper socialization and training, the Chessie makes an excellent family dog.
Chessies can be tolerant of other dogs when proper introductions are performed. However, they aren’t the best dogs for multi-dog homes due to their sensitivity and desire to protect their people. When it comes to cats and other small animals, socialization is vital. This is a hunting dog, so they may view small pets as prey to be caught, leading to injuries or even death.

A high-quality diet that meets WSAVA recommendations is the best baseline for choosing a food for your Chessie. For the average pet Chessie, a diet appropriate for their age will suffice. However, for working dogs, a sport dog food may be necessary to provide them with enough energy to perform and maintain their body weight. If your dog is more active sometimes, like during duck hunting season, you may need to adjust their daily intake, providing them with extra food on days when they’re active.
The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an active breed that needs daily exercise to thrive. They excel at canine sports, including agility, dock diving, Cani-cross, and obedience. They are happiest when provided with a job to do, but for a dog without a job, you will need to provide plenty of exercise every day. Running, hiking, and playing fetch are good options for keeping your Chessie active.
Early training is best for this breed. As they age, Chessies can become quite tenacious and may be rebellious. Starting training while the dog is still young will ingrain the training into them, helping ensure you have an obedient adult dog. When it comes to hunting and retrieving, the Chessie is driven by strong instincts, so many will naturally perform these tasks with minimal training.
The Chessie has a rough, short outer coat with a soft undercoat. They are moderate shedders, but weekly brushing will reduce loose hair and dander. Brushing will also distribute the natural oils of the Chessie’s coat, maintaining the natural waterproofing and the health of the skin and coat. It’s also crucial to keep the nails trimmed to prevent breakage and injury to the feet. They are prone to ear infections, so routine cleaning of the ears with a vet-approved ear-cleaning solution may be necessary, especially for dogs that swim a lot.

Male Chessies are slightly larger than females, with males reaching up to 26 inches and 80 pounds, while females typically stay below 24 inches and 70 pounds. Regarding temperament, females are usually more laid back and less likely to be aggressive than males. Females also tend to be more loving and gentle. Conversely, males are likely to have a higher energy level than females, as well as a stronger protective instinct.

The Chessie may be a versatile dog, but retrieving is their strongest skill. Generally, a Chessie could be expected to retrieve around 100 ducks daily, but some reports indicate that Chessies can retrieve even more.
Like other dogs developed for retrieving game from water, the Chessie has webbed feet. This provides them with built-in “flippers” that make them more powerful swimmers than dogs without webbed feet. Being a strong swimmer serves the Chessie well in the icy waters of the Chesapeake Bay.
In 1807, two St. John’s Water Dogs arrived in Maryland, forming the basis for the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Sailor, the male, and Canton, the female, were not recorded as having had puppies together, but both dogs were bred to other dogs in the area, including Hounds and Spaniels. The combination of traits that were put together in the breed’s early days resulted in one of the finest retrieving canines in the world.

The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an excellent retriever with strong instincts for performing their job and protecting and loving their people. They can be stubborn but are typically trainable and eager to please their people. They are emotionally sensitive and are suitable for therapy work, and their many great qualities also make them reliable working and hunting dogs.

The majestic Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a unique breed among other Retrievers. Unlike its counterparts, this breed was mixed with various local canines, such as Water Spaniels, Setters, and Hounds, without any specific selection. Its ancestry is believed to include two Lesser Newfoundland puppies (or St. John’s Water Dogs) that were rescued by an American ship in 1807. Despite having similar behaviors to other Retrievers, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a distinct genetic makeup. Its striking appearance is characterized by a wavy brown coat that is somewhat oily and musky, along with amber eyes and a strong, robust physique. Originally bred for waterfowl retrieval, these dogs are now commonly kept as pets and hunting companions. Known for their cheerful, bright, clever, and obedient nature, they particularly enjoy working, especially in the water. Grooming needs for this breed are minimal, requiring only a brief weekly brushing and bathing three to four times a year.

The Chesapeake Bay Retriever gets its name from its place of origin, the Chesapeake Bay. In 1877, dogs from both shores of the bay were recognized as one of three versions of the Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog. They were later consolidated in 1918 as the single Chesapeake Bay Retriever. The breed’s lineage can be traced back to 1807 when two puppies were rescued from a sinking ship in Maryland. These agile dogs were given to the rescuers as a token of gratitude and they turned out to be skilled water retrievers. It is believed that local dogs like Hounds and Water Spaniels were bred with these two puppies. There are also claims that the breed descended from crosses with the English Otterhound, flat-coated Retriever, and curly-coated Retriever. Over time, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever emerged as a distinct breed known for its ability to repeatedly swim through rough icy waters to retrieve ducks. They have gained popularity beyond the Chesapeake Bay area due to their exceptional skills. The breed was officially recognized by the AKC in 1918, and it is considered to be one of the few dog breeds that originated in America.

This type of dog is robust and muscular, with hindquarters that are as high as or even higher than its forequarters. It is somewhat longer than it is tall. The webbed feet of this Retriever have well-rounded toes, and the legs are fairly strong. Wide-set, medium-sized to huge eyes on the head have a curious appearance.

Sailor dog is a type of dog that was bred to accompany sailors on their voyages.
The Chesapeake Bay Retriever finds its origins around the Chesapeake Bay area, in the United States of America, from the early 19th century. The breed is believed to be descended from two Newfoundland dogs named Canton, who as a black female, and a red male, Sailor, who were traveling on a ship from England to Maryland, in 1807. According to the legends, the ship sunk, however, fortunately, these two dogs saved the majority of the ship’s crew. Canton found a home with Dr. James Stewart of Sparrow's Point, and Sailor was taken home by John Mercer of West River.
During the early 19th century, wealthy duck club owners lined both shores of the Chesapeake Bay area. These hunters were the firsts who sought after developing a new breed, which, ideally, would be able to endure the shallow bay, with its freezing water temperatures. Hunters really needed a good and reliable hunting companion, for the reason that the Chesapeake Bay area was located along the Atlantic Flyway, which is a flight path taken by geese and ducks to their winter homes. Each year, the bay hosted a third of all the migratory waterfowl wintering on the East Coast, thus it was a great and fruitful hunting environment. Consequently, they started to breed a new dog, using partly the Newfoundland specimens from the ship. Later, they added the Labrador Retriever and the Irish Water Spaniel to the gene pool too. This mix resulted in the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, who came out with a thick, oily, double coat, which was both insulating and water-repellent, its repelling moisture like the duck’s feathers do. Furthermore, the dogs’ broad chest could be used as a plow against the ice floes and the powerful hindquarters and large webbed feet enabled the dogs to swim tirelessly against the slashing winds that whip across the bay. Consequently, it is safe to say, that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is the perfect combination of Newfoundland’s swimming capabilities, and the Labrador’s physical attributes and talented retrieving skills. Interestingly, it has been reported by some hunters that some Chesapeake Bay Retriever specimens were able to retrieve more than 300 ducks in a single day.
By the time the AKC was founded in 1884, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, or in its other name, the Chessie was an already well-established breed with an accepted breed standard. The American Chesapeake Club was founded in 1918, with the intention of popularizing the breed among the hunting communities, as well as among the families.
Nowadays, even though the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is not the most popular retriever breed, although, the dogs are considered to be the toughest of them, who are willing to work even in ice-cold water all day long. The breed’s role did not change much during the decades, it is still employed to do various roles, including drug or bomb detection, and search-and-rescue work, helping the mentally or physically disabled.
