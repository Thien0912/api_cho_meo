Beagles are adorable, playful, and kind dogs. They are known for their intelligence and great hunting skills. So, is it a good idea to keep a Beagle and a cat together? The answer to this question is yes, it is possible, but it depends on each individual animal. According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), Beagles 1 “are generally friendly with other animals. They are loving companions who are likely to see cats as just another member of the pack.” However, these characteristics specific to the Beagle do not necessarily mean that cohabitation with a cat will be without conflict.
In this article, we explore ways to make cohabitation between a Beagle and a cat more peaceful, along with tips on how to introduce your little hunting dog to a new feline friend.

It’s natural to assume that these two animals can’t get along. After all, most common knowledge about keeping dogs and cats as pet friends is based on the assumption that their natural instincts will kick in sooner or later. Of course, many households that have both animals seem to refute this theory. Still, not all dogs and cats are created equal, and each has their own personality and temperament. The likelihood of your animal friends getting along (or not) directly correlates to their specific needs. Some cats are more independent than others, and some dogs are friendlier than others.
Yes, a Beagle and a cat can live together. These two animals can usually learn to get along fine if given a chance. This is especially true if the Beagle is raised along with the cat from a young age. Generally speaking, dogs and cats don’t naturally get along because they have different needs and behaviors, which can sometimes lead to conflict. Dogs are typically more social and friendly, and cats are usually more solitary and territorial. The key to overcoming these aspects is taking the time to understand each of your pet’s needs and personality. Only then can you work to create a safe and healthy living situation for everyone.

Before adding a cat to your home, remember that felines are different creatures from dogs. Make sure your new cat has everything that they need while being careful not to neglect your Beagle’s needs in the process. Ensure that you have the right food and toys and a designated area for each animal to call their own. For the Beagle, that might mean giving your dog a designated corner where your canine companion can feel comfortable away from the cat. For your cat, that might mean having a place to perch or hide where your dog can’t go. In general, it’s a good idea to set clear boundaries with each animal. For example, if your cat likes to sleep in the hammock, it’s probably not a good idea to let your Beagle jump up there.
If your Beagle likes to chase, it’s important to consider this before bringing a new kitten into the house. This is one of the biggest reasons that dogs with a strong prey drive and cats don’t always get along. This isn’t to say that every Beagle will chase a cat, but it’s something to be mindful of if you are bringing a cat into a Beagle home. Fortunately, there are plenty of toys and games that you can play with your pup that don’t involve chasing. There are also many ways to keep your dog busy and engaged without them going after the cat.
As with any relationship, the best thing that you can do for your Beagle and cat is to give them time to get to know one another. This is especially true when introducing a new cat to an existing dog. To make friends, your Beagle and cat will need time to adjust and become comfortable with one another.
Once your new kitten is in the house, keep them and your Beagle separated until both animals are comfortable and relaxed with each other. This is especially true if one or both of the animals are young and full of energy.
As your new cat becomes more relaxed in their new home, you can begin to introduce them to the dog:
Side note: For extra safety, use a pet barrier to separate your cat and your Beagle when you need to be away from the house for an extended period of time.

At the end of the day, the best thing that you can do for your Beagle and your cat is to be patient and understanding. Both animals have their own unique needs and habits that should not be overlooked when trying to determine if one can live with the other. When bringing a cat into the home with an older Beagle, for example, it’s important to let both animals set their own pace. If you’re bringing a kitten into the home with an adult Beagle, it is likely that both animals will need to adjust their pace to meet the other’s needs.
In short, be prepared for an adjustment period, set up a designated space for each animal, follow a routine that suits the needs of each animal, and never leave them unsupervised at first. With time, patience, and understanding, your Beagle and your new kitty will likely become firm friends.

Considering welcoming a Beagle into your home? Before you buy or adopt one, here are a few important things to remember.
Considering welcoming a Beagle into your home? Before you buy or adopt one, here are a few important things to remember.
Beagles are considered a moderate shedding breed. They are prone to shedding all year round, but this can be particularly heavy in the spring time when a Beagle loses its thicker winter fur – something known as “blowing coat”. There’s nothing you can do to stop shedding, but brushing your dog regularly will help to remove some of that loose hair and keep your Beagle’s coat in tip top condition!
As they shed more than other breeds, Beagles are not recommended as suitable for allergy sufferers. It’s important to remember that no dog breed is truly hypoallergenic, but some breeds are better for those with allergies than others.
Beagles are inquisitive, energetic dogs who love to discover new things. However, their curious streak, strong sense of smell and hunting instinct can make them easily distracted. Beagles need a training approach of clarity and consistency with areas such as the recall and general good manners and it’s best to start training at a young age to make lessons stick.
Dogs in general are loyal pets who love the company of their “pack”, but some breeds are more independent than others. Beagles are fundamentally pack dogs and don’t tend to enjoy being alone for long periods. They are happiest in the company of their owners or other pets (as long as they are properly introduced).
Due to their sociable nature, Beagles tend to get on well with other pets in the household, including cats. However, Beagles have a strong prey drive and may be prone to chase cats, which could cause them distress. Proper introductions from a young age will help ensure your Beagle and cat get along.
Beagles are generally considered to be good first-time dogs due to their smaller size and even-tempered personality. They are adaptable and fit well into most environments. However, they can be more difficult to train than other dogs due to their curious and energetic nature.

Choosing the right insurance for your Beagle can help keep them happy and healthy whatever happens. Conditions that we see they are prone to are not always covered as some other providers’ policies limit what they’ll pay for certain conditions, like cruciate ligament injuries. Others won’t cover your pet for dental illness or injury, or for congenital and hereditary conditions. With Petplan’s Covered for Life® dog insurance we have no additional limits for specific conditions or diagnostic tools.

The Beagle is a small-sized scent hound from England who was primarily bred to track small game such as rabbits and foxes. With a short, smooth coat in various colors, including white, black, brown, and tan, the Beagle is known for their happy-go-lucky spirit. It’s rare to see these little dogs without their tails wagging. The Beagle temperament is characterized by friendliness, playfulness, and intelligence. Their incredible sense of smell can lead them astray if they catch a scent during outdoor walks, so owners should ensure their dogs are on a leash to prevent them from wandering too far. They are still used for hunting today but are also popular as companion dogs. This breed is relatively low-maintenance, only requiring regular exercise and grooming.
Training is essential for Beagles, and their intelligence makes them quick learners. However, they can also be independent thinkers and stubborn, especially if they catch an intriguing scent during training sessions. Positive reinforcement, especially in the form of tasty treats, works wonders. Beagles make good companions for other dogs and cats, especially if raised together early. Early socialization and positive experiences with other animals can further enhance their amiable disposition.
When considering a Beagle, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you’re searching for Beagle puppies for sale, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Beagle breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for their puppies. This active approach ensures you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

It’s hard to resist the appeal of a Beagle’s dark brown or hazel eyes, accompanied by their soft, pleading expression. They exude happiness, outgoingness, and love, traits balanced by their hound nature, which makes them inquisitive, determined, and highly food-focused. While not yappy, they possess three distinct vocalizations—a bark/growl, a baying howl, and a half-baying howl, often used when they spot prey or decide it’s time to wake the neighborhood at 6 a.m. As pack dogs, Beagles generally get along well with other animals and eagerly embrace new human friends.
The most significant characteristic of the Beagle is their scenthound nature. Their nose takes precedence, always close to the ground, constantly searching for intriguing trails to follow. With approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to our paltry 5 million, Beagles can detect scents exceptionally. Dave Barry humorously referred to his in-laws’ Beagle as “a nose with feet.” This incredible sense of smell has even led to their use at airports, where Beagles patrol baggage-claim areas to sniff out contraband food. Their small, friendly, and cute demeanor puts people at ease, allowing them to focus on specific food articles while disregarding non-contraband items.
Despite their versatility, Beagles remain exceptional hunters of small game. AKC-sanctioned field trials at the National Beagle Club’s Institute Farm and similar activities in many other countries put breeders with packs to the test, showcasing the Beagle’s superb hunting skills.
The Beagle’s adaptability makes them suitable for apartment living, provided they receive regular on-leash walks several times a day, regardless of the weather. They thrive with about an hour of exercise daily, and without adequate exercise and attention, they can exhibit destructive behaviors if left alone for extended periods.
Origins: The Beagle originated in England, and it is believed to date back to Roman times. The modern breed was developed for hunting small game, particularly rabbits.
Size: Beagles are a medium-sized breed, typically weighing 20 to 30 pounds and standing about 13 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder.
Coat: They have a short, dense, weather-resistant coat that comes in various colors, including tri-color (black, white, and tan), lemon, and red and white.
Temperament: Beagles are known for being friendly, curious, and sociable. They are often good with children and other pets.
Intelligence: Beagles are intelligent dogs with a keen sense of smell, making them excellent scent hounds. This can, at times, lead to their strong-willed and independent nature.
Exercise Needs: Beagles are energetic breeds that require regular exercise to keep them physically and mentally stimulated. Lack of exercise can lead to boredom and potentially destructive behavior.
Famous Beagles: Snoopy, the fictional character from the “Peanuts” comic strip, is one of the most famous Beagles. The breed has also been featured in various films, TV shows, and commercials.
Popularity: Beagles consistently rank among the most popular dog breeds in the United States due to their friendly disposition and versatility as both family pets and working dogs.
The origin of the word “beagle” remains uncertain. Some theories suggest it could have derived from the French word “begueule,” meaning open throat, or the Old English word “beag,” meaning small. Others propose it may have come from the French word “beugler,” meaning to bellow, or the German word “begele,” meaning to scold.
The breed’s history is also shrouded in ambiguity, as the concept of modern breeds didn’t fully develop until the 19th century. Ancient Greek documents from 400 B.C. mention Beagle-like dogs, and it is believed that the Romans brought small rabbit-hunting hounds to England and crossed them with local hounds. These small hounds, possibly the ancestors of Beagles and Foxhounds, were introduced by William the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest in 1066.
Beagles gained popularity early in English history. During the reigns of Edward II and Henry VII, tiny Glove Beagles were in vogue, said to be small enough to fit in a gloved hand. Singing Beagles were also named for their melodious voices. Elizabeth I kept packs of Pocket Beagles, standing only 9 inches tall, depicted in paintings as short-legged and pointy-nosed. However, they fell out of favor due to their lack of speed.
In the 1700s, the Foxhound took precedence over the Beagle in England, as fox hunting became the favored sport. The breed would have declined further if not for farmers in England, Ireland, and Wales, who kept Beagle packs for hunting hares and rabbits, preventing their extinction.
In the mid-1800s, Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a Beagle pack in Essex, England, believed to be the ancestors of modern Beagles. Reverend Honeywood focused on hunting skills, not appearance. Concurrently, American breeders imported Beagles from England to improve their dogs’ looks. They bred them smaller for rabbit hunting, leading to strains like the “Patch” Beagle, known for its large tri-colored spot and speed.
The American Kennel Club and the first Beagle specialty club were founded in 1884. In the same year, the AKC started registering Beagles. In 1916, members of the National Beagle Club purchased land in Virginia to hold field trials, which is now the site of many activities for the National Beagle Club.
The American Kennel Club acknowledges two Beagle varieties based on height. The 13-inch variety is reserved for hounds not surpassing 13 inches in shoulder height, while the 15-inch variety is for hounds standing between 13 and 15 inches at the shoulder. Depending on their height, Beagles weigh anywhere from 18 to 30 pounds.
Beagles exhibit a gentle, sweet, and humorous nature that can bring plenty of laughter. However, their mischievous behavior may sometimes lead to moments of frustration. Beagle owners often attempt to outsmart their clever companions and resort to food rewards to encourage temporary obedience. Just like any dog, early socialization is crucial for Beagles. Exposing them to diverse people, sights, sounds, and experiences during their youth helps ensure they grow into well-rounded and balanced adults.
Not all Beagles will develop every listed disease, but it’s essential to be aware of these conditions if you consider this breed.
When purchasing a Beagle puppy, ensure the breeder provides health clearances for both parents, including tests for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, von Willebrand’s disease, thrombopathia, and normal eyes certified by the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF). Preparing for potential veterinary needs throughout your dog’s life is wise, and a pet insurance plan can help you stay ready.
A fenced backyard is essential for a scenthound like the Beagle. When outdoors, keeping your Beagle on a leash in open areas or securely confined and supervised is important. Beagles have a natural tendency to wander, so it’s common for them to try to escape. To ensure a swift return if they do get out, ensure your Beagle is microchipped and wears identification tags on their collar. Some people opt for underground electronic fences, but these may not deter other animals from entering your yard, and a tempting scent can lead your Beagle to disregard the momentary shock.
Obedience training is beneficial for all dogs, but Beagles respond best to positive reinforcement techniques. When treated harshly, they may switch off and become unresponsive. Most Beagles are highly motivated by treats, making them eager to learn and obey commands.
Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and require ample opportunities to release it. They enjoy walking with their family or running across a field to satisfy their hunting instincts (though proper recall training is crucial before off-leash activities). You can also take them jogging, but it’s best to wait until they are 18 months old for repetitive exercises like this.
As Beagles mature, they might become more sedentary and content to lounge around the house all day. However, it’s crucial to prevent them from becoming lazy and overweight, as they are prone to obesity. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are essential to keep your Beagle healthy and happy.
The recommended daily amount for Beagles is 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food divided into two meals. However, the actual quantity your adult dog needs depends on various factors such as size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Just like people, dogs are individuals, and their food requirements vary. Active dogs will need more food than sedentary ones. The quality of the dog food also matters; better-quality food provides more nourishment, so you may need to feed your dog less.
Beagles are known as food thieves and can easily raid your pantry or garbage if given the chance. They have voracious appetites and will eat until they are full. To maintain a healthy weight, measure your Beagle’s food and feed them twice a day instead of always leaving food out. If you’re unsure about their weight, you can perform the eye and hands-on tests. Look down at your Beagle – you should see a waistline. Place your hands on their back with your thumbs along the spine and fingers spread downward – you should be able to feel, but not see, their ribs without pressing hard. If you cannot feel the ribs easily, your dog may need less food and more exercise. Treats should also be given sparingly; small training treats work just as well as larger biscuits.
According to the breed standard, Beagles can come in “any hound color.” However, the most common color for Beagles is tricolor, featuring a black saddle across the back, white legs, chest, and belly, a white tip on the tail, and tan markings on the head and around the saddle. Another popular color combination is red and white, displaying an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs, and tail tip. Regardless of color, most Beagles have a white tip on their tails to make them visible while hunting in tall grass.
Beagles have a smooth, dense double coat that resists rain. To maintain their coat’s health, brushing them at least once a week using a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove is recommended. This helps loosen and remove dead hair and promotes new hair growth. While Beagles do shed, their short hair makes it less noticeable. Their coat may become thicker during winter, leading to more shedding in the spring. Beagles are generally clean dogs but may occasionally indulge in rolling in something unpleasant. As they are drop-eared dogs, their ears need special attention to avoid infections. Regularly check their ears for signs of infection or waxy buildup, and never allow water or oils to enter their ears.
Proper dental care is crucial for Beagles. Brush their teeth at least twice or thrice weekly to prevent tartar buildup and maintain good oral hygiene. Daily brushing is even better to ward off gum disease and bad breath. Regular nail trimming is essential to prevent painful tears and other issues. If you’re not experienced with nail trimming, seek guidance from a vet or groomer.
Introduce grooming and examinations to your Beagle from an early age. Handle their paws frequently to get them used to the sensation, and inspect their mouth regularly. Positive experiences during grooming with praise and rewards will make veterinary exams and other handling easier in adulthood. While grooming, also check for any sores, rashes, or signs of infection on their skin, nose, mouth, eyes, and feet. Conducting a careful weekly exam will help you identify potential health problems early on.
Beagles form strong bonds with everyone in the family, particularly with children. However, due to their playful nature, they can sometimes be exuberant during playtime. Proper socialization and supervision are essential, especially when interacting with young children. Beagles may exhibit “mouthy” behavior, playfully grabbing objects, including hands, with their mouths. While this is usually done in fun, they can be trained not to do so. As with any dog breed, it’s important to teach children how to approach and interact with dogs and to always supervise their interactions.
Children should be educated never to disturb a dog while it’s eating or sleeping, and they should avoid attempting to take the dog’s food away. Under no circumstances should a dog, no matter how friendly, be left alone with a child without adult supervision. Beagles have a pack dog heritage, making them sociable animals that thrive on companionship. They dislike being left alone for extended periods. To fulfill their need for companionship, having another dog or even a cat as a playmate can benefit their well-being.
Beagles are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. The following rescue groups can help you find Beagles needing adoption or fostering.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems or socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.
