Cat Breeds
Gorgeous kitties with cashmere soft coats, Turkish Van cats are renowned for their fun-loving personalities and their often quirky behaviors.
If you're thinking about bringing a Turkish Van cat into your family, be sure that you have plans for keeping this intellectual kitty entertained. These cats don't do well when left alone for long periods of time; however, they do get along very well with other animals and can form strong bonds with dogs as well as with their fellow felines.
While Turkish Van cats can be child-friendly when kids behave appropriately, they do have boundaries. They prefer fun, active interactions rather than too much holding and cuddling, and they will not tolerate hair pulling or any other form of mishandling. Despite having a slight aversion to too much handling, they sometimes choose to relax on a favorite person's lap for some well-earned TV time, and they like to sleep near people they trust.
Anyone who longs for an ultra-friendly cat that loves nothing more than spending time together will probably enjoy life with a Turkish Van. These kitties happily follow their people throughout the house, waiting for an opportunity to help with everything from paperwork to washing dishes.
Since these cats like water, their families often have feline company in the bathroom. If you want to make a Turkish Van cat happy, just leave a faucet running at a slow dribble. Those mesmerizing drips will almost certainly keep them entertained!
Speaking of entertainment, these cats are outstanding jumpers and they really don't like to spend much time on the floor. They absolutely require a tall cat condo and they truly appreciate window seats. Without high, suitable perches, they will make their own space on your tabletop, desk, or china cabinet, perhaps knocking important items to the floor in the process.
Turkish Van cats have no special needs, however good nutrition is important. If you're not feeding fresh food, be sure to offer a high-quality commercial brand that focuses on real meat or real fish as the primary ingredient. Consider choosing a brand that incorporates added Omega fatty acids to support healthy skin and a healthy coat.
The Turkish Van cat looks like a high maintenance kitty, but in reality, their soft, cashmere coat requires very little upkeep as it is a single layer. A quick daily once-over with a fine-toothed comb should be enough to prevent tangles. If you live in a colder climate where days get shorter and your cat is exposed to chilly temperatures or lower light, then longer fur might grow over the winter, increasing the need for comb-outs.
Because Turkish Vans are so athletic, it's probably a good idea to keep their claws trimmed short to prevent too much damage to your furnishings. In addition, you'll want to offer routine dental care.
From a young age, teach your cat to be brushed, have their nails trimmed, and have their teeth brushed. This can prevent the stress and discomfort that comes with unnecessary struggles as the cat grows older.
You probably won't have to encourage your Turkish Van cats to exercise. These kitties are natural athletes, with a tendency to seek the highest possible vantage point from which to survey their domain.
Lots of jumping and running helps maintain fitness for a lifetime. These kitties love their toys and have a natural appreciation for interactive games. If you throw a small, soft toy, your cat might be able to catch it in midair and may even bring it back to you for another round of fetch.
Turkish Van cats are typically healthy, with no known genetic defects; however, some do develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the most common form of heart disease in cats.
If you happen to adopt a white Turkish Van cat - also known as a Turkish Vankedisi, then there’s a fairly good likelihood that the cat will be deaf, particularly if it also has blue eyes. Even if the cat is not completely deaf, it may have a hearing disorder. This should not cause problems for your kitty, but you’ll need to find nonverbal ways to communicate.
The history of the Turkish Van cat begins in 1955, when two British photographers visited Turkey, having been tasked by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism with promoting travel and publicizing Turkey’s attractions. While they were there, Sonia Halliday and Laura Lushington were given cats with a distinct Van pattern, which became the foundation for the Turkish Van cat breed.
The female cat was from Hatay Province, Iskenderun, and was named Van Iskenderun Guzelli. The male was named Stambul Byzantium, and was given to the breeders by an Istanbul hotel manager.
More cats were acquired in 1959, including a female from Antalya, appropriately named Antalya Anatolia, and a male named Burdur, who came from the city of Burdur.
In 1969, the breed - then known as the Turkish cat - was recognized by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Later, the breed was renamed to distinguish its members from the Turkish Angora. Later still, all-white Turkish Van cats - those not displaying the signature pattern that restricts color to the head and tail - were renamed “Turkish Vankedisi.” These cats share everything but the Van coat pattern with their cousins.
In 1977, Lushington wrote a memoir about the first two founding members:
"I was first given a pair of Van kittens in 1955 while traveling in Turkey, and decided to bring them back to England, although touring by car and mainly camping at the time – the fact that they survived in good condition showed up the great adaptability and intelligence of their breed in trying circumstances. Experience showed that they bred absolutely true. They were not known in Britain at that time and, because they make such intelligent and charming pets, I decided to try to establish the breed, and to have it recognised officially in Britain by the GCCF."
In 1982, Turkish Van cats made their way to the US from Britain. It took over a decade for the US-based Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) to grant recognition. Finally - in 1994 - the breed could be registered and shown at CFA events.
The Turkish Van is a natural cat breed, and no outcrossing is permitted; in fact, all contemporary Turkish Van cats can be traced back to the original imports.
On average, CFA registers just 100 new Turkish Van kittens per year, making this one of the rarest cat breeds in the world.
Turkish Van cats take a long time to grow up: These kitties reach full maturity between the age of three and five years.
The Turkish Van cat is nicknamed "the swimming cat" because of the breed's fondness for water. The first Turkish Vans were famous for hopping into pools whenever their human companions jumped in to cool off.
Many Turkish Van cats are odd-eyed, meaning they have one blue eye and one amber eye. This is a trait that's shared with a few other breeds including Turkish Angoras.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The Turkish Van, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed Turkish Van or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase a Turkish Van, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
Turkish Van cats cost between $800 - $1500.
Turkish Van cats tend to be large in size. A fully grown Turkish Van cat might weigh between 7-20 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 9"- 11" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for Turkish Van is 12-17 years.
Turkish Van are long-haired cats, so you do have to expect a certain amount of shedding from this breed, but they don't shed as much as other cat breeds.
We found are Turkish van in the animal shelter in Naples ,fl. When we walked toward the cage he saw my son and reached his foot between the bars and meows to my boy, at that second I knew we had the perfect cat! He’s 17 now and about 18 lbs,ill never be ready to loose him tho I know he’s reaching the limits for a van!
Hi I went to the shelter a year ag today and this white kitten reached out his paw to me to! I adopted him and knew he was special, loves water, hyper, bites me when he wants to play. He has a striped tail mark on side looks like a little heart when he sits, the mark on his shoulder blades, his ears too. I just too some new pictures the other day and it brought up the Turkish Van. Every thing I’ve read sounds so rare for him to have been at a shelter. I loved the story of your son George stole my heart tithe same way!
I was looking for a regular cat on Kijiji as a pet for my daughter.  Answered an ad with no photo.  The owner on the phone said they had no photos, only described him as white and orange – 2 years old.  When I went to see him right away I commented on his unusual markings.  Wasn’t until 2 years later I found out he’s purebred Turkish Van Cat.   His name is Goose and  he’s actually a big turkey!
I am seaking for a Turkish van kitten. I had the breed
before and cherished her so much. She lived to a ripe
age of 19.
     When she passed I was heartbroken, we had such
a bond.
I adopted a cat recently, his piercing blue eyes are what drew me to him. His coloring is exactly like the first cat at the top of the page only he is skinnier. He has long silky hair that is light tan on his back that transitions to a darker tan at base of tail all the way to tip of tail. His looks just like a duster. I have been doing research and i think he may have some Van in him along the way do to all these points and markings. His personality so far is just as described.
We adopted from a PetSmart in 2010. Beautiful 9 month old kitten. Silky white fur with black tail and two black spots on his ears. We believed him to be a ragamuffin but the more I learn about Turkish Vans the more I believe Cricket to be one.
I love the breed. They are smart and fun loving. Comes when called and follows you from room to room. I love the one I have.
We had a very young Van show up at the house. He was hungry and in need of companionship. He is very vocal, answers all my questions and acknowledges complements. Very smart, follows me everywhere, loyal, and loving. Not afraid of water. Great with other pets.
My last kitty was a van cat I got as a kitten from a breeder. He was truly the most unique temperament of any car I’ve ever had.  More like a dog most of the time.  Loved babies (animals and humans), would come when called, played fetch, etc. Amazing boy. I made him an indoor kitty for the first half of his life which he hated. We moved to a quiet suburb and I let him out and he was the happiest cat in the world. I think this breed needs a little freedom. Two things this article fails to mention which I found true with my cat and owners of other vans I’ve met. 1) very vocal. This cat will happily talk your ear off in a multitude of tones. 2)clumsy. Don’t expect them to land on their feet when they flop off of things or even jump too high haha. They will also knock over anything and everything they can.
On May 1, 2022, I adopted, from a shelter a 12 year old  white cat that I believe to be a Turkish Van cat.  Her blue and green eyes are the most beautiful. I was so lucky adopting her. She is sweet, smart and beautiful.
Thanks for adopting, Maria! Glad to hear things are working out with your new friend!
The facial markings on the cat at the top of the page do not appear o be consistent with a Turkish Van. I would have guessed Siberian for this cat.
My Turkish van cat named Lucky found me when he stepped out in front of my car…….thus his name. I’m  not really a cat person so for me to love & keep him is saying something.
I wouldn’t trade him for anything
Glad you two found one another, and it sounds like it was a lucky moment indeed. Thanks for sharing!
My guy was found roaming a Car Lot. He was my first cat as I also was just a dog person. I never expected to fall in love with him and was surprised at how smart he is. He looks just like a Turkish Van an acts like one too.
I have a cat believed to be a Turkish van that fits every description but does not like to be in water and has a black leather only nose, not pink. She even has the thumbprint of God/Allah. Can the little black leather nose eliminate her from being a Turkish Van?
The Turkish Van breed standard describes a pink nose, and I’ve not been able to find any information on a possible black nose leather variant.
So sweet,loving and fun! I wouldn’t have another breed!
--------------------------------------------------
The Turkish Van is a semi-long-haired, standardised breed of domestic cat, which was developed in the United Kingdom from a selection of cats obtained from various cities of modern Turkey, especially southeast Turkey.[1]: 112  The breed is rare,[2] is one of the larger breeds, and is distinguished by the Van pattern (named after the breed), where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white;[2] this is due to the expression of the piebald white spotting gene, a type of partial leucism.[3]: 148  A Turkish Van may have blue or amber eyes, or be odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour).
The breed was first recognised as such by a breeder/fancier organisation, the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), in 1969, under the name Turkish cat.[1]: 113  It was later renamed Turkish Van to better distinguish it from the Turkish Angora breed.  The Turkish Van has been claimed to be descended from (and is often confused with) the landrace of usually all-white Van cats, mostly found near Lake Van,[2] though one of the two original breeders' own writings indicate clearly that none of the breed's foundation cats came from the Van area.[1]: 114 [4]
Breed standards allow for one or more body spots as long as there is no more than 20% colour and the cat does not give the appearance of a bicolour. A few random spots are acceptable, but they should not detract from the pattern. The rest of the cat is white. Although red tabby and white is the classic Van colour, the colour on a Van's head and tail can be one of the following: red, cream, black, blue, red tabby, cream tabby, brown tabby, blue tabby, tortoiseshell, dilute tortoiseshell (also known as blue-cream), brown-patched tabby, blue-patched tabby, and any other colour not showing evidence of crossbreeding with the point-coloured breeds (Siamese, Himalayan, etc.). Not all registries recognise all of these colour variations.
While A registries recognise all-white specimens as Turkish Vans, most do not. The US-based Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA, the world's largest registry of pedigreed cats) and Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe, the largest international cat fancier organisation) recognise only Van-patterned specimens, as they define the breed by both its type and pattern. The Germany-based but international World Cat Federation (WCF) considers the all-white specimens a separate breed, which it calls the Turkish Vankedisi,[5] a name that is easily confused with the landrace Van cat, which is called Van kedisi (two words) in Turkish. In other registries, the all-white cats are not considered show quality and are therefore actively bred against. They are prone to deafness; this is a common defect with many all-white animals.[6]
In 1955, two British photographers, Laura Lushington and Sonia Halliday, while on assignment in Turkey for the Turkish Ministry of Tourism, were given two unrelated cats in Turkey, which Lushington took home with her and allowed to mate. When the offspring came out identical to their parents – chalk white with dark tail and head markings – she set to establishing a standardised breed, originally named Turkish cat, later Turkish Van, and having it recognised by the British cat fancy organisations. Lushington returned to Turkey to find another pair, with the goal of breeding to the standard "three clear generations".[6]
According to Lushington, her original imported cats were: Van Iskenderun Guzelli (female), a cat that came from Hatay Province, Iskenderun, and Stambul Byzantium (male), a cat given by a hotel manager in Istanbul, both in 1955. Two later additions to the gene pool were Antalya Anatolia (female), from the city of Antalya, and Burdur (male), from Burdur city, both in 1959. Lushington did not see Van city before 1963, and only stayed there "for two days and two nights".[4] It is unclear why the name "Turkish Van" was chosen, or why one of the original 1955 kittens was named "Van Iskenderun Guzelli", given their provenance. Of the founding 1955 pair, Lushington wrote, in 1977:
I was first given a pair of Van kittens in 1955 while travelling in Turkey, and decided to bring them back to England, although touring by car and mainly camping at the time – the fact that they survived in good condition showed up the great adaptability and intelligence of their breed in trying circumstances. Experience showed that they bred absolutely true. They were not known in Britain at that time and, because they make such intelligent and charming pets, I decided to try to establish the breed, and to have it recognised officially in Britain by the GCCF.[1]: 114
It is unclear whether Lushington was intending to imply that the Hatay and Istanbul kittens had originally come from the Lake Van region, or was simply referring to the Turkish Van foundation stock as "Van kittens" for short. Neither city is near Van Province, and there is no evidence that specimens of the Van cat landrace were ever among the foundation stock.
The Turkish Van was given full pedigree status in 1969 by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Called simply the Turkish cat at this point,[7] the name was changed in 1979 in the UK (1985 in the US) to Turkish Van[2][8] to better distance the breed from the Turkish Angora cat (originally called simply Angora,[1]: 35  an old spelling of Ankara).
The Turkish Van began to be imported into America in the 1970s. Beginning in 1983, two Florida breeders, Barbara and Jack Reark,[citation needed] worked to popularise this breed, and in 1985, The International Cat Association (TICA) granted the Turkish Van championship status. In 1988, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) accepted the breed for registration in the miscellaneous class. The CFA later bestowed provisional status to the Van in 1993, and championship status in 1994. In that first year, four Turkish Vans attained the grand title.
The Turkish Van is a large, muscular cat with a moderately long body and tail. It has strong, broad shoulders and a short neck; the jock of the cat world. The body of a Van should neither be stocky, or thin. It should call to mind the body build of an athlete, and indeed, it is one of the largest cats.[6] They take from 3 to 5 years to reach their full maturity and when they do males range in weight from 10 - 20 pounds with females ranging from 7 - 12 pounds.[9]
The coat on a Turkish Van is considered semi-long-haired.[2] While many cats have three distinct hair types in their coat – guard hair, awn hair, and down hair – the Turkish Van has no evident undercoat, only one coat.[6] This makes their coat feel like cashmere[2] or rabbit fur. The lack of an undercoat gives a sleek appearance.[2] The coat is uncommonly water repellent,[2] which makes bathing these cats a challenge, though the coat dries quickly. The breed actually has two lengths of hair, determined by season. In the winter, the hair is thick and long. In the summer, the hair sheds to leave a shorter, lighter coat.[6]  The coat begins short at birth and grows in gradually over a period of three to five years, so that the kittens may be short-haired in appearance, with thin tails, but as they mature, the fur on the chest will fill out, and the tail will thicken into a full brush tail. The tail does not shed hair or change according to the season, but remains long and full. The ears remain feathered with fur, so that even with its summer coat, the Van looks soft and fluffy.[6]
The Turkish Van is one of the larger cat breeds. Ideal type should feature broad shoulders with a body that is "top-heavy", that is, a cat with its center of gravity forward. The cat is moderately long, and its back legs are slightly longer than its front legs, but neither the cat itself nor its legs are so long as to be disproportionate. They have large paws and rippling hard muscle structure which allows them to be very strong jumpers. Vans can easily hit the top of a refrigerator from a cold start on the floor. They are slow to mature and this process can take 3 years, possibly longer. Vans have been known to reach 3 ft (1 m) long from nose to tip of tail.
A Turkish Van may have blue eyes, amber eyes, or be odd-eyed[2] (having one eye of each colour, a condition known as heterochromia iridis).
The breed typically has very large ears when it is a kitten, growing into its ears over time. The nose is straight and Asiatic, considered long for a semi-longhair, and with its high cheek bones, and startlingly bright eyes, it gives off quite an exotic appearance.[6]
The TICA standard[9] notes several characteristics, including their high intelligence, energy and playfulness – also making them somewhat mischievous. Muscular and highly driven, they like to climb and perch high up, to study their environment, and they get around their domain with impressive athleticism. They make quite successful hunters as a consequence. Their drive makes them easily trainable with positive reinforcement – to play fetch, do tricks or walk on a leash. Although there may be efforts to move the breed towards greater sociability.[2] a 2021 study in Finland[10] did find that the Turkish Vans in their research showed higher than average tendencies towards fearfulness, aggression towards humans, as well as a lower stress tolerance (notable excessive grooming and litter-box problems), and lower sociability to humans and cats.
Curious, Turkish Vans want to be with their owner participating in whatever is happening, and so they may follow a person from room to room.[9] While Turkish vans are affectionate to their family members, these are not normally lap cats. They may lie next to their owners and will happily allow themselves to be petted, but this is not a breed that tolerates being picked up and often wants to be near their owner, not on their owner.[11]
Turkish Vans do well in a single-pet household and don't seem to suffer much from separation anxiety. When put in a home with other cats, they much prefer being around other Turkish Vans. Dogs can be no problem as long as they are introduced properly and patiently.[11]
When it comes to families, Turkish Vans are happy to play with children, but care must be taken to make sure small ones are reminded that the breed may not enjoy being held, and may strike out if forced into such a situation.[11] The native Van cats of Turkey have been nicknamed the "swimming cats", due to an unusual fascination with water.[4] Despite the modern Turkish Van breed consisting almost entirely of pedigreed, indoor-only cats with no access to large bodies of water, and despite dubious connections between them and the cats of the Lake Van area, some feel that the Turkish Van has a notable affinity for water; for example, instead of swimming in a lake, they may stir their water bowls or play with water in the toilet,[6] and some may even follow their owners into water.[2] However, the idea that the breed likes water more than other cats may be mistaken according to some pet writers.[12]
The Turkish Van is largely free of genetic issues and breed-specific health defects. Unlike the Turkish Angora, the Turkish Van does not have issues with deafness.[11]
Additionally, due to the Turkish Van's larger size, spay or neutering procedures are sometimes delayed to around 1 year of age, as an early adjustment to their hormone levels can affect how their bones and muscles grow.[11]
The piebald spotting gene (partial leucism) appears in other different species (like the horse and the ball python). It also shows up in other breeds of cat, since the Van pattern is merely an extreme expression of the gene.[3]: 148
The breed's variability of eye colour is genetically caused by the white spotting factor, which is a characteristic of this breed. The white spotting factor is the variable expression of the piebald gene that varies from the minimal degree (1), as in the blue-eyed cats with white tip on the tail to the maximal degree (8–9) that results in a Van-patterned cat, when coloured marks occupy at most 20% of the white background, but the white background in the breed covers about 80% of the body. Breeding two cats together with the same level of white spotting will produce cats with a similar degree of spotting.[3]: 148
Van-patterned Turkish Vans are not prone to deafness, because their phenotype is associated with the Van pattern (Sv) semi-dominant gene. Solid-white Turkish Angoras carry the epistatic (masking) white colour (W) dominant gene associated with white fur, blue eyes, and often deafness. All-white cats of Turkish Van stock may share this gene. All three types of cat may exhibit eye colours that are amber, blue or odd. Deafness is principally associated with white cats having two blue eyes.[3]: 191
--------------------------------------------------
While the Turkish Van Cat is not very fond of sitting on laps, they will happily cuddle next to you and sleep in your bed. They are one of the few domestic cat breeds that are completely comfortable in water. In fact, they may even try to play in your bathtub, sink, or even the toilet if you’re not careful.
The Van is not a cat that you should leave home alone for long periods of time. They are highly intelligent and need plenty of stimulation to prevent boredom. If they don’t get it, they may create their own fun by engaging in destructive behavior. Also, don’t leave your breakable items out in the open, as Turkish Van cats have a habit of knocking things over just to see what will happen.
When considering a Turkish Van, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a cat in need. However, if you decide to purchase, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their cats. Reputable Turkish Van breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their cats, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the kitties. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy kitty while discouraging unethical breeding practices.
Some cat breeds are typically independent and aloof, even if they’ve been raised by the same person since kittenhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn’t the only factor that goes into affection levels; cats who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.

Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems. This doesn’t mean that every cat of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they’re at an increased risk. If you’re looking only for purebred cats or kittens, it’s a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you’re interested in.

Some cats are perpetual kittens—full of energy and mischief—while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful kitten sounds endearing, consider how many games of chase the mouse-toy you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other animals who can stand in as playmates. A classic wand cat toy like this one is perfect for playful felines!

Some breeds sound off more often than others with meows, yowls, and chattering. When choosing a breed, think about how the cat vocalizes and how often. If constant “conversation” drives you crazy, consider a kitty less likely to chat.

Being tolerant of children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a nonchalant attitude toward running, screaming youngsters are all traits that make a kid-friendly cat. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual cat will behave; cats from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences and personality.

Stranger-friendly cats will greet guests with a curious glance or a playful approach; others are shy or indifferent, perhaps even hiding under furniture or skedaddling to another room. However, no matter what the breed, a cat who was exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a kitten will respond better to strangers as an adult.

Known as the swimming cat for his propensity to play in bodies of water—or at least to enjoy splashing his paws in it—the Turkish Van is an ancient breed thought to have originated in the Lake Van area of Turkey. The mountainous and rugged landscape and cold climate of the region no doubt contributed to the development of the Van’s cashmere-like coat and solidly built body.
The Turkish Van is a natural breed and has probably existed in his homeland for centuries. Legend has it that he swam ashore from Noah’s ark, which tradition says landed on Mount Ararat in Turkey, not far from Lake Van.
How did the Van come by his spots of color? Both Jewish and Islamic tradition say that the cats were the recipients of a divine touch that imparted color to their formerly white coat. On the ark, a door slammed on the cat’s tail, turning it red, and God reached out and touched the cat on the head, leaving a spot where his hand rested. In the Islamic version, Allah touched the cat on the back, and the spot that is sometimes seen on a Turkish Van’s back is known as the thumbprint of Allah.
However he came to be, the Van has been attractive to many of Turkey’s invaders and visitors over the years. At least a few probably made their way to Europe as “souvenirs” in the past millennium. It wasn’t until the 1970s, though, that a Turkish Van was first brought to the United States. The International Cat Association recognized the breed in 1985, and the Cat Fanciers Association began registering it in 1988. In Turkey, the cats are considered national treasures, and their preservation is overseen by the Turkish College of Agriculture and the Ankara Zoo.
Turkish Vans weigh 10 to 18 pounds at maturity.
When he is properly socialized in kittenhood, this is a social and affectionate cat who is strongly attached to members of his family, although he may choose one or two as his favorites. He is highly active and athletic, remaining playful into his senior years. Athletic doesn’t mean graceful, however. The Van is big and ungainly; this is one cat who doesn’t always land on his feet.
Turkish Vans are highly intelligent and can learn tricks and games, including playing fetch. They like teaser toys that allow them to mimic pouncing on prey. And if you can’t find your Van, look up; he is probably perched overhead, as high as he can get. Don’t put anything on display that is easily broken; the Van has a wicked sense of humor and may enjoy pushing items off a shelf just to see what happens. Or sometimes he’s just clumsy.
The Van may or may not be a good traveler. Trips to the veterinarian often involve the cat vomiting, peeing or pooping in the car. If you like to RV or take road trips with your cat, ask the breeder if cats in her line are prone to carsickness. The Van’s love of water can lead him into trouble. Put down toilet seats and cover swimming pools and spas if you aren’t there to supervise his aquatic excursions. And resign yourself to finding your faucets dripping. He can easily learn to turn them on so he can drink from them or play in the sink. It’s not unusual for a Van to simply enjoy lying in water, especially during hot weather.
A Van dislikes being held or restrained, and it is a rule at cat shows that the cats are displayed on the table instead of being held up in the air. Most notably, if you are ever unsure of how a Van is feeling, pay attention to his Vanometer. That pretty shell-pink nose will start to turn red if your Turkish Van is upset. If his nose shading from pink to crimson, heed the warning and leave him alone. He’s not much of a lap cat, but the Van will be happy to cuddle next to you and sleep in your bed. He will also give firm direction as to the proper way to pet him.
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Turkish Vans are generally healthy, although some have been reported to develop the following:
The Turkish Van has a single coat with a silky texture. Because there’s no undercoat to cause mats or tangles, it’s easy to groom with weekly combing or brushing with a slicker brush. It sheds very little except during spring and fall when old coat is falling out or new coat is coming in. Older cats may have difficulty grooming themselves thoroughly, so it can be a good idea to brush or comb them more often. The Turkish Van‘s coat is water-resistant, so be glad that baths are rarely necessary.
Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.
Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will also help to keep the long coat clean. It’s a good idea to keep a Turkish Van as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Turkish Vans who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
You might think that the Turkish Van is a white cat with patches of color, but genetically you would be wrong. He is, in fact, a colored cat with very large patches of white, a pattern caused by the piebald white spotting gene. The result is a cat whose body is mostly white, with colored markings on the head and tail. He may also have random spots of color on the body and legs. This type of coloring is sometimes seen in other breeds and is known as the Van pattern.
As befits a cat who was formed to survive in a rugged landscape and climate, he has a strong, powerful body with a broad chest and shoulders and long, muscular legs. Males are much larger and more muscular than females. Keeping the Turkish Van cozy is a soft, semi-long single coat with feathering (longer hair) on the ears, legs, feet and belly, a ruff around the neck, and a fully plumed tail.
Kittens and young adults have a less developed coat than mature adults. The coat doesn’t achieve its full length until the cat is at least two years old. In summer the coat is short, but it becomes substantially longer and thicker in winter. This is a large breed; they can take three to five years to reach their full size.
The Van who has been well socialized is comfortable with kids, making him a good choice for families with active children who will enjoy running around with a teaser toy, throwing a ball for the cat to fetch, or teaching tricks. Supervise young children to make sure they pet the cat nicely and don’t pull his fur or tail.
The Turkish Van is happy to live with cat-friendly dogs, too, as long as they recognize that he’s in charge. When it comes to cats, he prefers the company of his own kind, but he will accept other cats, especially if he is brought up with them from kittenhood. In any case, introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.

The Turkish Van is a rare and ancient breed with a rich history that dates back to the Lake Van region of Turkey. This breed is believed to have existed for thousands of years, with records suggesting they were companions to the people of the area as far back as the Middle Ages.

2. Name History
The name “Turkish Van” reflects both the breed’s origin and its connection to Lake Van in Turkey. The word “Van” in the breed’s name specifically denotes the region from which these cats hail.
Interestingly, the Turkish Van is also known as the “swimming cat” due to its unusual love for water, which further distinguishes it from other breeds.
3. Appearance
The Turkish Van is a medium to large-sized cat, known for its robust and muscular build. They have a semi-longhaired coat that is uniquely soft and water-resistant, allowing them to swim with ease.
One of the most striking features of the Turkish Van is its color pattern, often referred to as “Van pattern.” This typically involves a white body with colored markings, usually red, on the head and tail.
The eyes can be blue, amber, or odd-eyed (one of each color).

4. Temperament and Personality
The Turkish Van is known for its active and playful personality. These cats are highly intelligent, curious, and have a strong desire to explore their surroundings.
Unlike many other cat breeds, the Turkish Van is often described as dog-like in its behavior, forming strong bonds with its owners and enjoying interactive play.
They are affectionate but also independent, making them well-suited for families who can engage with their energetic nature.
5. Training and Behavior
Training a Turkish Van can be a rewarding experience due to their intelligence and curiosity. These cats can learn tricks, fetch toys, and even walk on a leash with the right training.
They are known to be quick learners but may also exhibit stubbornness at times. Positive reinforcement is key when training a Turkish Van, as they respond well to treats and praise.

6. Grooming Needs
Despite their semi-longhair, Turkish Vans have relatively low grooming needs. Their unique coat lacks an undercoat, making it less prone to matting and shedding.
Regular brushing once or twice a week is usually sufficient to keep their coat in good condition. Bathing is rarely necessary unless they get into something dirty, as their water-resistant coat tends to stay clean.
7. Exercise Requirements
Turkish Vans are energetic cats that require regular exercise to stay healthy and happy. They enjoy active play sessions, climbing, and even swimming if given the opportunity.
Providing plenty of toys, scratching posts, and opportunities for climbing will help keep them mentally and physically stimulated.
Interactive toys, such as feather wands or laser pointers, can also be great for engaging their hunting instincts.

8. Living Environment
The Turkish Van is adaptable to various living environments but thrives in a home where they have space to roam and explore.
They do well in both apartments and houses, as long as they have enough mental and physical stimulation.
Given their love for water, some owners may even consider providing a shallow water dish or safe access to a pool for supervised swimming sessions.

9. Food
A balanced and nutritious diet is crucial for the Turkish Van’s overall health. They should be fed high-quality cat food that meets their specific dietary needs.

Some Turkish Vans may have a preference for wet food, which can be beneficial for their hydration. It’s important to monitor their weight, as these active cats can easily become overweight if overfed.
Consult with a veterinarian to determine the best feeding schedule and portion sizes for your Turkish Van.
10. Health
Turkish Vans are generally healthy cats with a lifespan of around 12 to 17 years. However, like all breeds, they can be prone to certain health issues.
Regular veterinary check-ups are essential to monitor their health and catch any potential problems early.
Maintaining a healthy diet, ensuring regular exercise, and keeping up with vaccinations and parasite control are key to keeping your Turkish Van in optimal health.
11. Common Health Issues

While Turkish Vans are typically healthy, they may be predisposed to a few specific health issues. These can include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common heart condition in cats, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Regular screenings and early detection are vital to managing these conditions.
Additionally, because they love to swim, care should be taken to ensure they are not exposed to cold water, which could lead to respiratory issues.
12. Lifespan
With proper care, a Turkish Van can live a long and healthy life, often reaching 12 to 17 years of age. Some Turkish Vans have been known to live even longer, particularly when provided with excellent care, a balanced diet, and regular veterinary attention.
Their relatively robust health and active lifestyle contribute to their longevity.
13. Compatibility with Other Pets
Turkish Vans are generally friendly and can get along well with other pets, including dogs and other cats, especially if they are introduced properly. Their playful and social nature allows them to adapt to multi-pet households.

However, their high energy levels and desire for attention mean they may not tolerate being ignored or left out of the action.
14. Breed Standards and Recognition
The Turkish Van is recognized by major cat associations such as The International Cat Association (TICA) and the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA).
To meet breed standards, Turkish Vans should have the characteristic “Van pattern” with a predominantly white body and color only on the head and tail.
The breed standard also emphasizes their muscular build, large size, and unique eye colors.
15. Famous Examples
The Turkish Van has captured the attention of cat lovers worldwide, including a few notable examples in popular culture. While there aren’t many famous Turkish Vans, the breed’s unique traits have made them a favorite in cat shows and among enthusiasts.

Their reputation as “swimming cats” has also made them the subject of various media features and documentaries.
16. Adoption vs. Breeders
When considering adding a Turkish Van to your family, you have two primary options: adoption or purchasing from a breeder. Adopting from a shelter or rescue organization can be a rewarding experience, as you are giving a cat a second chance at life.
However, Turkish Vans are rare in shelters, so finding one might be a challenge. Purchasing from a reputable breeder ensures you know the cat’s lineage and health history, but it can be more expensive.
17. Where to Get It
Finding a Turkish Van can be more challenging than other breeds due to their rarity. Reputable breeders specializing in Turkish Vans are the most common source. It’s important to research breeders thoroughly, ensuring they follow ethical practices and provide healthy, well-socialized kittens.
Alternatively, you can check with breed-specific rescue organizations or attend cat shows where Turkish Vans may be featured.

18. Price
The price of a Turkish Van can vary depending on factors such as lineage, breeder reputation, and location. On average, you can expect to pay between $400 to $1,500 for a Turkish Van kitten from a reputable breeder.
Cats from champion bloodlines or those with rare color patterns may command higher prices. In addition to the purchase price, consider ongoing costs such as food, grooming, and veterinary care.
19. Cost of Ownership
Owning a Turkish Van involves more than just the initial purchase price. Ongoing costs include high-quality food, regular grooming supplies, toys, and routine veterinary care.
Additionally, you may need to invest in interactive toys and climbing structures to keep your Turkish Van entertained. Budgeting for potential health issues, especially as the cat ages, is also essential.
20. Legal Considerations

There are typically no specific legal restrictions on owning a Turkish Van, but it’s important to check your local regulations, especially if you plan to breed or sell them. Some areas may require pet registration or have specific laws regarding the keeping of exotic or rare breeds.
If you’re importing a Turkish Van from another country, ensure you follow all necessary import and vaccination requirements.
21. Socialization Tips
Early socialization is key to raising a well-adjusted Turkish Van. Start by introducing them to various environments, people, and other pets gradually. Use positive reinforcement to create positive associations with new experiences.
Because they are naturally curious and confident, Turkish Vans usually adapt well to socialization, making them friendly and outgoing companions.
22. Nutritional Needs
A balanced diet is crucial for the Turkish Van’s overall health and well-being. High-quality commercial cat food that meets AAFCO standards is recommended. You might consider a mix of dry and wet food to ensure they get the right balance of nutrients and hydration.

Because of their active nature, Turkish Vans may require a slightly higher calorie intake, but be cautious to avoid overfeeding, as obesity can lead to health issues.
23. Breeding Considerations
If you’re considering breeding Turkish Vans, it’s important to have a thorough understanding of their genetic history and potential health risks. Breeding should only be done by experienced individuals who are committed to maintaining the breed’s standards and health.
Ensure that both the male and female are healthy, free of genetic disorders, and meet the breed standard. Responsible breeding also involves finding good homes for kittens and ensuring they are well-socialized before they leave for their new families.

The Turkish Van is a playful and intelligent breed that is ready to take you on an adventure. With a striking wisp of color topping their head and its tail painted to match, this mostly white cat is one of the rarest in the world. Let us introduce you to the Turkish Van!
The Turkish Van is regarded as one of the most beautiful cats in the world, with their predominantly white body that is kissed with darker markings on their head, tail, and/or back of their shoulders. These fur decorations are known as the “Van Pattern.” These markings can come in many colors and arrangements, including black, blue, and red. Their patterns can be solid, tortoiseshell, or tabby. The most famous design for the Van is a burst of red or brown on their head and tail. More rare are solid all-white Vans, which are known as “Turkish Vankedis” or "Van Kedi".
The Van’s body is often compared to a swimmer’s body, as they have large  barrel-chests matched with a durable and extended frame. Their tail is lengthy and sturdy, known for its beautiful blossoming fur. They have a stocky neck attached to broad shoulders and can weigh up to 18 pounds (8.16 kg). This is why the Vans are frequently referred to as the ‘jocks’ of the cat world. The Van’s coat is soft to the touch and absent of an undercoat. With semi-long hair that is often compared to cashmere. The Turkish Van has two coat lengths depending on the season; the winter coat is longer and thicker than its shorter and thinner summer coat.
The history of the Turkish Van dates back to between 6,000 B.C. and 3,000 B.C. Considered one of the oldest breeds in the world, ancient artifacts have been found that depict cats that are believed to resemble the Turkish Van. The modern history of the Van can be traced to Sonia Halliday and Laura Lushington. They were two British photographers on assignment in 1955 to capture images of Lake Van, the largest body of water in Turkey. They were gifted two (unrelated) Turkish Vans after they completed their assignment. Each cat had the "Van pattern" that is now famously associated with the breed. The two cats were mated and served as the base-lineage for Turkish Van cats in England. The Turkish Van was officially introduced in the United States in 1982.
Not one for long cuddles, the Turkish Van is all about adventure and action! They want to play and are well known for their dynamic personalities. These cats have strong and deep relationships with their guardians. They insist on getting a lot of attention and plenty of opportunities to play. Often, if they do not get the amount of acknowledgment they want, they will indeed let you know. Vans are an extremely talkative breed and will talk, sing, and yell at you whenever they see fit. Due to the Turkish Van’s activity level and territoriality, they are not recommended for homes  with small children.  Vans truly like to be up in high places and enjoy looking upon their environment from atop of shelves and refrigerators. Vans are confident and seem to take the position as the defender of the home, and may growl if they are threatened.
Turkish Vans are relatively healthy cats. However, like all cats, there are things to watch out for to help them live their best lives. The Van breed can be prone to obesity if they don't have the space to run around the house or plenty of toys to play with. Daily physical and mental stimulation is a must for this cat. Vans can also develop a heart condition known as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HMC). HMC is one of the most common heart diseases found in cats. While the Turkish Van is not at a higher risk for deafness as some cat breeds, genetically determined deafness does appear to be closely associated with the white spotting gene and the dominant white gene (excluding the albino white gene. Deafness in white cats is more common among those cats with blue eyes or with heterochromia.  This is because the white gene can occasionally cause the degradation of the cochlea (the part of the inner ear involved in hearing) in addition to disrupting melanocyte migration into one or both eyes.
They have a coat that's perfect for swimming.  The Van is known as the “Swimming Cat” and they often seek any form of liquid they can find. This means that a Van’s owner must be on high alert when it comes to sinks, toilets, and cups left unattended. They are known to jump in the shower or bath with you as well, and as a highly intelligent breed, they can learn how to turn on faucets and flush toilets.
They are known for the three V's. Turkish Vans are very soft, very vocal, and very active!
Their name is distinguished. The Turkish Van is also known as just ‘The Van.’ Formally known as the ‘Turkish Cat’ upon their initial discovery, people often confused the Turkish Van with the Turkish Angora. The term ‘Van’ was added at the end of the name to differentiate the two cat breeds.
They are believed to have ancient Biblical roots. The Turkish Van is believed first to be introduced in the story of Noah’s Ark; As Noah began to pair animals two by two upon his arc, a pair of what later would be known as Turkish Vans boarded. During the journey, it is said that the two cats jumped into the water and swam towards the closest shore. Once the rain had diminished, the cats began to walk across the land, eventually making a home in Lake Van.
