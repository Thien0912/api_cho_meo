Borzois, also known as Russian Wolfhounds or Long-Haired Greyhounds, are large dog breeds that are named after the Russian word for “fast or swift”. These elegant dogs require regular exercise and enjoy spending time with their owners. While they don’t need frequent baths, their long, silky coats do need regular brushing to keep them looking their best.
Originating in Russia, Borzois are sighthounds that rely on their keen vision and swift running during hunts. They were specifically bred for coursing and hunting wolves, foxes, and rabbits. Hunting in groups of three, they would work together to catch their prey. As time went on, Borzois gained popularity as beloved pets of royal families in Europe.
Ahead, we look at Borzoi dog breed, its history, personality, pros and cons of owning an Borzoi, characteristics, and must-know facts. We will also examine how to care for this breed and much more. Prepare for a tail-wagging adventure into the world of Borzois!
The Borzoi is a breed of dog known for its speed and agility. It originated in Russia in the 17th century, resulting from a cross between the Arabian Greyhound and a Russian Sheepdog with a thick coat. Bred by aristocrats, the Borzoi was primarily used for coursing, which became a popular sport among the Russian aristocracy. Standards for the breed were established in 1650.
However, during the Russian Revolution of 1917, many Borzoi dogs were killed due to their association with the czars. Notable figures such as Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales, and King Edward VII were gifted Borzoi by the Czar of Russia. Queen Alexandra not only owned Borzois as companions, but also bred and exhibited them. In the 1920s to 1940s, the breed gained popularity in America and was considered a glamorous dog. They were often seen with silent movie stars like Jean Harlow, Hope Hampton, Greta Garbo, and Sarah Bernhardt, and were even featured as models in the Art Deco era. Famous individuals like Marilyn Monroe and the artist Picasso also owned Borzois. The breed is now part of the AKC Hound group and belongs to the Sighthound family of dogs. In late 1936, the name of the breed changed from Russian Wolfhound to Borzoi.

They feature long, thin legs, a small body, a deep chest, curved backs, a tucked tummy, and a long tail, just like the Greyhound. Both the tail and the hindquarters of borzois are feathered. The head of the Borzoi is somewhat domed, with an unusually long and narrow face and muzzle. It also has a powerful neck and jaw. Strong and having an even or scissor bite, the teeth are. Their eyes feature a gentle look and are dark in hue. The Borzoi appears very graceful and elegant but is also robust, quick, and nimble. Both the males and the females are at least 26 inches tall.

The Borzoi can get bored with monotonous activities, but they do well in competitive obedience and agility events as well as with training that is motivational. The breed is self-assured and independent, so they don’t require continual care. Since the Borzoi was developed for coursing, it is in their nature to chase animals like cats, little dogs, and young children. Once engaged in a pursuit, they can become unyielding and unaware of their surroundings, even disregarding the risks of oncoming traffic or the owner’s cries.
Borzoi dogs are most comfortable being the sole pet in a family. They are not particularly friendly towards strangers, children, cats, or other dogs.

Many people don’t know much about the Borzoi. They are not very popular, ranking just 101st overall by the American Kennel Club (out of 201 possible breeds). The Borzoi is an elegant, statuesque, and somewhat mysterious dog with a great appearance and an interesting personality profile. These dogs can make great companions for people who like large dogs and can also fill a need for people looking for a beautiful and slender canine. Here is everything you need to know about the interesting and unique Borzoi.
Height:
26–30 inches
Weight:
60–105 pounds
Lifespan:
9-14 years
Colors:
Sable, Gold, Red, Brindle, Blue, Fawn, Mahogany, White, Black, Tan, Cream (and any combination thereof)
Suitable for:
People looking for a beautiful dog with a rich pedigree who aren’t afraid to put in some work
Temperament:
Calm and agreeable but can be stubborn and protective
The Borzoi is a purebred hunting dog that is considered to be a large breed. The largest Borzoi dogs can weigh over 100 pounds and stand over 30 inches tall. Borzois were originally bred in Russia to hunt wolves, so they are very tough, yet they can also be sweet, caring, and loving. The Borzoi is known for its slender body and long curly hair. This is one of the few large breed dogs with a long and luxurious coat. Borzois have a fascinating history that weaves a tale that connects the Russian aristocracy, the Romanov family, and the Russian Revolution.

The best way to get a Borzoi puppy is to contact a registered breeder. Borzois are not very common, nor are they particularly popular. That means that the chances of stumbling upon a Borzoi in a local shelter or in a rescue group are very low. If you want a Borzoi puppy, you are going to have to go through a breeder. It is recommended to use a registered breeder as they have a good reputation and will screen for genetic and congenital health issues. Since Borzoi health issues are almost all genetic, a registered breeder is very valuable in heading off any potential problems down the line.
The American Kennel Club describes the Borzoi as loyal, affectionate, and regal. These dogs can be very loving and very chill. However, they also warn that they can be protective and stubborn. Their size can make them hard to handle if they get excited or anxious. Borzois have an average intelligence level, and they won’t wow you with their smarts, but they are intuitive, and they absolutely adore their owners.
Yes. Borzois are great family dogs. However, some Borzois will not do great with small children. Their large size plus their background as a hunting dog can make them difficult to manage around small children. Small children do not have the spatial or social awareness that it takes to deal with large dogs, and kids have a chance to upset a Borzoi, which can lead to trouble. Families with older children should do fine with a Borzoi.
Borzois will need ample exercise and attention. They will also benefit from a house with a yard and some indoor space they can stretch out in. They might not fit in a small house or a house with a small or nonexistent yard.
Usually. Borzois can get along with other pets, including other dogs, but that will not always be the case. Since Borzois are hunting dogs, some of them can have a strong prey drive, and they can be protective and watchful. That means that some Borzoi will chase other animals, like cats, and might not settle in as smoothly as some people would like. It is advised to try out a Borzoi with your pets before buying one to ensure that the dog will be a good fit for your family situation.

You would think that since Borzois are large dogs, they would eat a lot, but that is not necessarily the case. Borzoi puppies eat a decent amount due to their high growth rate, but adults do not eat much more than the standard dog. You should consider putting your Borzoi on a joint health or joint supplement food. Since many health problems that Borzois can experience involve the health of their joints, a well-formulated joint food can help them as they age. The earlier you put your Borzoi on a joint health food, the better. Borzois are at a moderate risk for obesity, so you should not overfeed your dog. You should also avoid overfeeding because too much food paired with strenuous activity can increase the risk of bloat.
Borzois are energetic dogs that require a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. You should walk your Borzoi at least twice per day, and each walk should last 30 minutes or more. If you do not give your Borzoi the proper amount of exercise, they can get anxious and occasionally destructive. You also need to provide your Borzoi with ample mental stimulation. Mental stimulation keeps Borzois from becoming mischievous. You can provide mental stimulation by letting your Borzoi spend time outdoors, as well as giving them toys that will keep their brains engaged. Borzois that do not get enough exercise and mental stimulation can become hard to handle, especially given their large size.
Training is often necessary for a well-behaved Borzoi. Borzois can be willful and stubborn, which is a bad combination when you factor in their size. Experts recommend socializing your Borzoi from a young age for the best experience. You should put your Borzoi in a large number of situations and consistently reward good behavior while ignoring bad behavior. A poorly socialized Borzoi can be anxious, protective, and occasionally aggressive. Again, these are traits that you do not want to have in a dog that can weigh over 100 pounds.
Borzoi are not the smartest dogs in the world, but they can be trained in the ancient hunting arts. Borzoi are hunting dogs at heart, and you can train them to go out with you on the trail. They can still be used in a hunting capacity.
The Borzoi has moderate to heavy grooming requirements. The Borzoi has a long coat which requires regular maintenance to keep them looking and feeling their best. You should brush your Borzoi once per day or every other day to remove any tangles, mats, or debris that might get into the fur. You will also want to bathe your Borzoi once per week. Borzois shed once per year, and during this shedding period your dog will let off a large amount of hair for two to three weeks. Borzois also need regular nail trims to keep their nails at a manageable and healthy length. If you are unable or unwilling to do these basic grooming activities, you should consider getting a smaller dog or a dog with a shorter coat. Neglecting the Borzoi’s grooming needs can lead to health problems and can cause your dog to look and feel bad.
Borzois are typically healthy dogs. The breed is free from many potential pitfalls, and responsible breeders are often able to screen and eliminate most problems from their stock. However, the Borzoi does suffer from issues that affect many large dogs. The most dangerous potential health issue for Borzois is bloat. Bloat is a potentially fatal condition that affects most large breeds and deep-chested dogs. You should consult your veterinarian about the signs and treatment of bloat. Bloat requires immediate medical attention to avoid disaster. Other issues that affect Borzois include dysplasia of the hips and elbows, which can lead to mobility issues and arthritis in older dogs. Borzois can also suffer from osteochondritis dissecans, which is a joint condition. Buying from responsible breeders and putting your Borzoi on food for joint health can help mitigate some of these issues.

The biggest difference between male and female Borzois is the size. Female Borzois are noticeably smaller than males. Females typically weigh 15 to 20 pounds less than males. Males are built thicker and taller than females. Males will stand multiple inches taller than females. If you want a smaller dog and a leaner dog, you should look into getting a female Borzoi. If you want a larger dog, one that can stand over 30 inches tall and weigh over 100 pounds, you will want a male Borzoi.

The Borzoi is a wolfhound with a royal pedigree. Wolf hunting was one of the most popular and widespread activities for the Russian aristocracy during the 19th century, and the Borzoi was the dog of choice for these activities. Most aristocrats had Borzois and bred them in earnest. This made the dogs very popular, and they quickly became a symbol of the Russian upper class and of the Romanov family as a whole. The interest in wolfhounds during this time is why the Borzoi still exists today.
The eminent Russian writer Leo Tolstoy had a soft spot in his heart for the Borzoi dog. He would often include the dog in his writing, including in his momentous work “War and Peace.” Tolstoy’s love of the Borzoi highlights its Russian pedigree and shows how popular the dogs were during the Romanov era in Russia.
The Russian Revolution saw the demise of the czarist regime in Russia. During the revolution, communist revolutionaries seized the royal palaces, which included their kennels. These kennels were filled with royal Borzoi dogs, many of which were killed. The Borzoi was seen as a symbol of the royal Romanov family, which made it deeply unpopular. No good communist could own a Borzoi in good conscience, which damaged the dog’s prestige and breeding stock. Between the slaughter of the royal stock of Borzoi dogs and the stigma that the dogs carried after the revolution, the Borzoi’s population and prestige were decimated.

Borzois are large and elegant dogs with a great history and pedigree. These dogs can be a good fit for certain families. They will thrive in environments where they get ample exercise and mental stimulation. They might not work for families with small children or other pets, but most of the time, the pairing should go smoothly. Borzois are great for people who like large dogs but also want a sleeker and more elegant dog than something like a bulldog or a mastiff.

The Borzoi is a dog you can’t help but notice. They’re hard to miss, for one thing, being as large as some adults are. This dog has a regal manner, thanks to the breed’s early association with the Russian aristocracy. Then, there is their body shape and form. This is a gorgeous pup that many artists find photogenic and noteworthy.
Height:
26 – 28+ inches
Weight:
60 – 105 pounds
Lifespan:
10 – 14 years
Colors:
Any color or combination of colors
Suitable for:
Individuals or families looking for a laid-back and friendly dog
Temperament:
Loyal, loving, adaptable, easygoing, independent
The history of the Borzoi goes back to the 13th century. Their original purpose was to hunt wolves. The United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the breed in 1914 and the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1891. The qualities of this noble breed made these decisions no-brainers.
It’s worth noting that this background meant that people were more likely to gift them to others than sell them. Their grace is even a part of the official breed standard. It’s fitting considering the conformation of the Borzoi from nose to tail. Despite their size, this pup is quite adaptable and can even be a city dweller.

Their background probably helps the Borzoi do well for a pet if you live in an apartment. This dog isn’t a barker, which also helps. That lifestyle is a boon, considering their wanderlust potential, meaning this dog will run if given a chance.
The Borzoi is laid-back with a moderate energy level. They will fare best if you can ensure they get enough activity to keep their weight in check. This pup isn’t overly playful. They’re happiest enjoying your company and hanging out together. That’s a good thing because they are prone to separation anxiety if left alone too long. However, they’re affectionate and want to share their love.
Despite their size, the Borzoi is relatively long-lived. Many similarly sized breeds have much shorter lives. If you prefer larger dogs, put this pup on your shortlist, as they have many qualities that you may find desirable.

You might think with the Borzoi’s history that this would be an aggressive dog, but that’s not the case with this pooch. Instead, you’ll find that they are affectionate and loyal. They are also intelligent, albeit with a stubborn streak that novice pet owners will find challenging. Their strong prey drive means that you should keep them in a fenced-in yard, too.
The background of the Borzoi made them fast runners. If you think they look like a Greyhound, you’d be right. The two are related. That accounts for their speed to chase after wolves. The temperament of this pup will likely remind you of a cat. How they carry themselves and their quiet manner are distinctly feline in nature.
The Borzoi is a social animal, and thus, will make an excellent family pet. They will even welcome strangers into your home. During the early days of the breed’s history, these dogs were guests at many lavish events attended by others in the aristocracy. You can almost say that socialization is inherent in the Borzoi.
It also isn’t much of a stretch to learn that this isn’t an overly playful dog. They will indulge you in a game of fetch, but they’re not a pup for roughhousing with the kids. They will do best in a home with older children who will respect their space.
The events we mentioned earlier also included other dogs. Therefore, they will probably get along with other pets in your household. Because of their size, it might be problematic if you have smaller pups. The same caution applies to cats. If a feline runs from them, a Borzoi will give chase. This dog has a high wanderlust potential and the tenacity to see it through to the end.

It’s a shame that this breed isn’t more popular. The Borzoi is a good-looking dog with lots of desirable qualities. However, owning a large pup like this one also has its challenges that a prospective buyer should know upfront. While this isn’t a vocal pooch, these dogs do have a moderate tendency to nip that you must curb while they’re a manageable size as a puppy. A full-grown adult is another story.
Their hunting background, with its formidable prey, means that the Borzoi has strong jaw and neck muscles. They are also courageous dogs that aren’t intimidated easily. Combined with their speed and size, that makes early training imperative.
For a dog that is as large as the Borzoi is, they don’t have the appetite to match. That’s because of their lean form, which gives them only a low propensity to gain weight. It’s essential to give your pup a food formulated for canines of their size. These dogs mature slower than smaller breeds. Consequently, their diets are less calorie-dense than a Yorkshire Terrier, for example.
Also, we recommend giving your pooch a diet that is appropriate for their life stage. Puppy foods are more nutrient-dense to support their early development. You can start by offering your Borzoi three meals a day. You can cut it back to two once they get older. Encourage your dog to eat as soon as you put down the bowl. Give them about 30 minutes and then pick it up from the floor.
The fact that Borzoi is a fast runner should tell you everything you need to know about how much exercise they must get. It’s an essential trait for their original job. Wolves are tireless, too. If you’re going to control the population, an equally matched opponent is crucial. As we’ve discussed, the high wanderlust potential means that you’ll have to supervise their activity outdoors.
We recommend at least an hour of walking, running, or playing each day. That will satisfy the Borzoi’s need for exercise and keep this intelligent pup mentally stimulated. That’s essential for their overall health. Their social nature means that they will play nice at the dog park. However, supervision is vital because of their size. The setting may get them too excited to interact with smaller dogs.
When you combine intelligence and independence, you know it’s going to be a handful. However, it’s not impossible to train them, you just need to assert yourself as the boss in your relationship. Bear in mind that this pup is sensitive to harsh reprimands. That’s not the way to connect with them. Instead, try positive reinforcement with treats, as you’ll have better luck.
Consistency is key. Remember that the Borzoi is smart. However, many pups, like this one, are eager to please. This dog just needs the right direction for you to make it happen, so stay persistent.
The Borzoi has a long coat that requires regular care. We suggest brushing them at least every couple of days to keep mats under control. A pin brush is an ideal tool for the job. It’s also an excellent time to bond with your pooch. Makes sure to check their ears for trimming and their toenails for clipping. This dog is one that you want to always look their best.
Overall, the Borzoi is a relatively healthy pup. Surprisingly, elbow and hip dysplasia aren’t significant problems with a dog of this size. They do have other issues that are equally as much of a concern, though.
There are both size and personality differences between the sexes. Males and females are significantly disparate in size if that’s a consideration for you. Males carry themselves as decidedly masculine and confident. Likewise, the females are feminine with all the grace you’d expect from a pup with their background.
In any case, consult with your veterinarian about the best time to spay or neuter your pet if you don’t intend to breed them. More pups are still intact, perhaps because of their scarcity.

Not many breeds can claim to be a part of literature history like the Borzoi. Tolstoy immortalized the dog in his masterpiece, War and Peace. It’s not hard to see why the dog captivated this famous author. The novel is an excellent testament to the pooch’s charm.
The Borzoi’s association with the Russian aristocracy almost led to their demise during the Russian Revolution. The breed was a favorite of the Romanov family. They, like everyone else, were casualties of the war. It took several decades and the dedication of the Borzoi’s enthusiasts to save the dogs for future generations.
The Borzoi hunted wolves and was thus called the Russian Wolfhound. They earned the name because of their prowess. History tainted this moniker. That prompted American breeders to find more neutral grounds. They chose the Russian word, “borzyi,” meaning “swift” as a homage to the dog’s historical role.

Few breeds have the charisma as the Borzoi. The pup’s connection with nobility speaks a lot to what you can expect from inviting this dog into your home. This dog brings along their history as a hunter of wolves with the dignity that is befitting of a canine that socialized with royalty. This dog is relatively laid-back with few needs other than enough exercise to satisfy their Greyhound roots.
If you have the time and space to keep them happy, the Borzoi is an excellent choice for families, especially those with older children. The breed is adaptable, so even if you don’t have a fenced-in yard, they’ll still fare well as a city dog. In return, you’ll have a loyal and affectionate pooch that is relatively low maintenance.

Borzois are also known as Russian Wolfhounds and Long-Haired Greyhounds. The name Borzoi translates from the Russian language to “fast or swift”. The Borzoi is a large dog breed who enjoys daily exercise but also relishes relaxing with their owner. The Borzoi’s long silky coat needs to be regularly brushed but he does not have to be bathed frequently. A medium to large dog, this breed is strong yet graceful. The Borzois are members of the Sighthound family originating from Russia. Sighthounds depend on their sight and high-speed sprinting ability during a hunt. The Borzoi was bred for coursing and for hunting wolves, foxes, and rabbits. They would hunt in teams of three and capture the prey together. They later became popular as a companion dog for royalty across Europe.
The Borzoi was named after his ability to be speedy and agile. The Borzoi originated in Russia during the 17th century.  The breed was a cross between the Arabian Greyhound and a thick coated Russian Sheepdog breed. The Borzoi was bred by aristocrats as a coursing sighthound and because of this, hunting with Borzoi became the national sport of Russian aristocracy. The first standards for the breed were written in 1650.   During the Russian Revolution of 1917 many Borzoi were killed because they were associated with the czars. Queen Victoria of England, the Prince of Wales, and King Edward VII were gifted Borzoi by the Czar of Russia. Queen Alexandra not only had Borzois as her companions, she also bred and exhibited them. In the 1920s through 1940s, the breed was considered a very glamorous dog in America. They were seen with silent movie stars such as Jean Harlow, Hope Hampton, Greta Garbo and Sarah Bernhardt and were popular as Art Deco models. Marilyn Monroe and the artist Picasso also owned Borzois.  Additionally, they have been photographed on the front page of Vogue and other fashion magazines. The Borzoi is a member of the AKC Hound group. It is in the Sighthound family of dogs; the name changed from Russian Wolfhound to Borzoi in late 1936.
Similar to the Greyhound, they have long, slender legs, a narrow body, deep chest, curved backs, tucked abdomen and long tail. Borzois have feathering on the tail and hindquarters. The Borzoi has a strong neck and jaw and his skull is slightly domed with an extremely long and narrow face and muzzle. The teeth are strong and have an even or a scissor bite. Their eyes are dark in color and have a soft expression.  The Borzoi has a very graceful and elegant appearance yet is agile, strong and very swift. The males are at least 28 inches tall, and females at least 26 inches. Males average 75 to 105 pounds and females 60 to 85 pounds. Their coat is long and somewhat silky, either curly, wavy or straight.  They have a thick ruff of curly hair around the neck. Borzoi Puppies tend to have curly coats.  Although all colors and patterns are permissible, white with patches is the most common pattern.
The Borzoi is a moderate shedder and requires daily brushing with a hard bristle brush.  The dog’s teeth should be brushed several times a week to prevent tartar buildup. Nails should be trimmed monthly and the ears should be cleaned weekly. The breed is not a high-maintenance dog; the Borzoi cleans and takes care of his own grooming, much like cats do. It is important to provide a proper high-quality diet that is specifically formulated for large dog breeds.  Because the breed is prone to bloat, it is better to feed them a few small meals throughout the day instead of one large meal. Borzois need regular exercise and enjoy long walks. If the Borzoi is well exercise, he can adapt well to apartment living. Due to the breed’s high prey drive, he should not be walked without a leash.  The Borzoi enjoy and are well suited for the cold winter months. Due to little body fat, the Borzoi can be sensitive to certain drugs, especially anesthetics. The drug Xylazine should never be used on a Borzoi.
The Borzoi can suffer from a variety of health problems. Secure pet health insurance today to avoid high veterinary care costs. Our pet insurance tool lets you compare plans from leading companies like Figo and Spot. Find the “pawfect” plan for your pet in just a few clicks!
The Borzoi can be high-spirited, loyal and devoted.  They need early socialization with other animals and people.  The adult Borzoi tends to be quiet and rarely barks.  The breed is very smart and highly sensitive.  They do not do well with harsh handling or punishment. Although the Borzoi is a large breed, he can adapt to a small living space if he is exercised daily. The breed has plenty of stamina and does well in cooler climates. The Borzoi can become bored with repetitive activity, responding well to motivational training, competitive obedience and agility trials. The breed does not need constant attention, they are confident and independent. The Borzoi was bred for coursing, so they have a natural instinct to chase things such as cats, small dogs, and small children. Once on a chase, they can become steadfast and oblivious to their surroundings, even ignoring the dangers of traffic or the calls of the owner.
