If you’re considering bringing a cat into a home with the Shetland Sheepdog or you already have a cat and want a Shetland Sheepdog, it’s important to figure out how they will interact with each other.
The good news is that usually a Shetland Sheepdog will get along fine with a cat, but they often need a bit of direction and training. So, how can you introduce a Shetland Sheepdog to a cat? Just keep reading and we’ll break it all down for you.

While the Shetland Sheepdog is a herding dog species, they usually get along great with cats. The reason for this is that a Shetland Sheepdog is extremely intelligent and highly trainable.
While they might want to chase a cat around at first, they’re extremely receptive to direction and will ignore the cat if you train them correctly. However, because a Shetland Sheepdog is a herding dog, it’s very important to take the time to train them correctly.
Finally, keep in mind that each cat and Shetland Sheepdog will have their own personality, and because of this, it’s important to supervise all interactions and take things slowly to see if it’ll be a good fit.
If you’re looking to introduce your Shetland Sheepdog to a cat, or you’re looking at adopting a Shetland Sheepdog and you already have a cat, there are a few things you can do to help ensure a successful integration.
You shouldn’t just throw a Shetland Sheepdog and a cat together and hope for the best. Instead, start slow. Get them used to each other’s scent, allow them to see each other, and slowly advance to each new step.
Give each animal plenty of time to fully adjust to the new step until they both reach a point where it no longer interests them. Only then should you proceed to the next step.
If you can teach your Shetland Sheepdog basic commands before you try to introduce them to the cat, it’ll be extremely useful. This will allow you to keep your Shetland Sheepdog under some control and help them understand what you expect from them.
If you see the signs that things might be about to escalate, having a basic “come” voice command for your pup can help you quickly get things under control.
When you introduce your Shetland Sheepdog to your cat, you need to be there. Not only should you hang out for the first visit, but you need to be around for the first few visits until they fully adjust to each other.
Often the Shetland Sheepdog and the cat will simply start to ignore each other, and when this happens, the likelihood of something happening between the two of them is low.
While your Shetland Sheepdog should get along, don’t take it for granted! Stay vigilant watching the two interact together and ensure you’re in a place where you can act quickly if something starts to escalate.

If you want a Shetland Sheepdog and a cat, there shouldn’t be any problems. However, don’t take anything for granted, start slow, and ensure you have control over both animals. With the proper training, time, and a bit of patience, there’s no reason you can’t bring both animals into the same home without any major problems!

Often referred to as Sheltie, this dog breed is a popular house pet. They're an agile and very energetic herding dog with a harsh and straight long coat and a dense undercoat. You can often find Shetland Sheepdog puppies with blue, black, or sable merle with quite a lot of white markings. These bright dogs are a joy to play with and they can’t get enough hugs and kisses.
Although the Shetland Sheepdog can be reserved around strangers and bark from time to time, once it gets comfortable there is no end to the amount of love it can give. You’ve probably also heard that this dog breed likes to tune in with the mood of the house. Well, there is some truth in it. Many Shelties are an exact replica of their adoptive parents. So, if you are happy, they will share your happiness! There is nothing better than that.
The Shetland Sheepdog is always eager to please and is an obedient, quick, and very intelligent companion. Despite their small size, these pups do love to jump around and have fun. But their brightness and eagerness are what sets them apart.
This dog breed is a world-class herding animal that displays agility and obedience. It is also a very affectionate companion, especially if you have another dog around the house.
When the two dogs get introduced, the Shetland Sheepdog is often seen as a kindred spirit. This dog breed loves to play and almost always displays friendly behaviour. It is not uncommon for them to be a little standoffish the first time they meet a friend. But, with time, all these boundaries can be lifted and the Shetland Sheepdog can enjoy a positive relationship.
When it comes to cats, this dog breed can get along just fine. First, however, the cat will put the Sheltie in its place, and then they can play.
Talk about obedience! Overall, you can expect the Shetland Sheepdog to learn tasks and tricks rather quickly. But, because of their constant energy, you would have to provide it with the necessary mental and physical stimulation. That’s where regular exercise can come in handy.
The Shetland Sheepdog is a perfect family companion. It loves a welcoming home with charming adoptive parents but it won't like spending too much time in the house alone. What this dog needs is love and attention. So, the owner that provides that will always keep the Shetland Sheepdog in perfect shape.
Because of this breeds friendly and obedient nature, you don't have to worry about being an expert trainer to train it. With a little bit of effort and attention, you can go a long way.
This dog breed has seasonal shedding. So, it is best to brush it about 2 to 3 times a week, just to make sure their coat is silky smooth. Because of their double coat, you can expect the fur to end up everywhere around the house. With regular brushing and the occasional bath, you will find it is easier to remove some of the loose hair and avoid matting.
One of the most important things to remember about this dog breed is that shaving is not recommended. Since its coat creates a natural protection against heat and sunburn, you should avoid shaving it. Instead, a regular trim will prove useful, particularly during the hot summer days.
The Shetland Sheepdog is often quite healthy but the older it gets, the bigger the odds are that they will develop some health issues such as eye disease, thyroid disease, or hip dysplasia.
To keep your dog in tip-top shape, it is a good idea to do a hip evaluation once a while and pair it with an ophthalmologist visit.
This will make sure that whatever illness might affect him, you can still keep it in check.
To help protect them if they become sick or have an accident, you can purchase Shetland Sheepdog Pet Insurance. This is a practical way to reduce healthcare costs and get a more affordable medical treatment for your canine friend. Shetland Sheepdog Pet Insurance can help you gain access to the necessary treatment, regardless of how complex the condition may be.
Hip Dysplasia is an inherited condition that means the thighbone doesn’t fit snuggly in the hip joint.
The symptoms are generally pain and lameness which will vary in severity and can be present in one or both rear legs.
Sadly, it’s not uncommon for the disorder to lead to hip replacement.
Make sure you ask any breeder if the puppy’s parents have been tested and cleared for Hip Dysplasia. If they have not, or the issue is present in one or both, find another breeder.
Patellar Luxation is a relatively common problem that occurs when the patella is not properly lined up. This causes the Femur (thigh bone), Patella (kneecap), and Tibia (calf) to slip out of place. When this happens, the dog will generally skip or hop.
There are four grades, ranging from I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe, and patella cannot be realigned manually.
The constant rubbing caused by this issue can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease and severe levels of Patella luxation may require surgery to avoid further issues and pain.
Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited condition which causes changes and abnormalities in the eye, sometimes leading to blindness.
Changes can include choroidal hypoplasia (an abnormal development of the choroids), coloboma (a defect in the optic disc), staphyloma (a thinning of the sclera), and retinal detachment.
Usually, Collie Eye Anomaly occurs by the time the dog is two years old and sadly there is no treatment.

First bred on the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy herding dog that would have not only herded cattle but protected and guarded them. He is a lively dog, still more than capable of working in the fields, and is a highly intelligent breed. As well as being a prized working dog, the Sheltie is also known for excelling at agility and other dog sports. He will thrive taking part in these competitions because they exercise both his mind and his body, and they allow him to form a close bond with his handler.
The Shetland Sheepdog is also renowned for being a loving family companion. He will usually get along with all family members, is gentle with children, and he can usually integrate well with other dogs and even cats. Although he can be wary with strangers, this will normally pass quite quickly and he will befriend visitors as though they were part of his pack.
His intelligence and willingness to please make the Sheltie easy to train. This, in turn, makes him suitable for first-time owners. However, he does require some care, not only in the form of regular and vigorous exercise, but to care for his beautiful coat, too.

The Shetland Sheepdog is highly revered for its herding and working capabilities, as well as for its show-stopping coat and its prize-winning agility and sports performance. It also makes a loyal and loving companion suitable for individuals and families.
Do make sure you choose a reputable breeder. They will have had the parent dogs’ health checked and screened for conditions like hip dysplasia. They will also ensure that the parents and puppies are kept in ideal conditions, and they will have started to socialize and potentially even train the dog before you pick him up. This early socialization is especially important with the Sheltie because the breed can be wary around strangers. Through good socialization, they learn that new situations and new people do not need to be feared. Puppies also learn these skills from their parents. They learn how to react around people and in new situations from their mom, so you should try and meet your puppy’s parents to see how they react. Ideally, both the puppy and the mother will approach you without being scared.
Although the Sheltie does make an excellent family pet, they do have high energy requirements and they take some grooming. They also tend to be vocal. This means that some Shetland Sheepdogs might end up in local shelters.
The Sheltie is a highly intelligent dog. They not only excel at learning commands but thrive on the training because it keeps their brains agile. They have the mental acuity to take on numerous tasks. They do require a lot of physical exercise, and they tend to shadow their owner all day, every day.
The Sheltie is a gentle and caring breed. They are referred to as a shadow breed because they will form a very close bond with their owner and they tend to stick to your feet as you walk around the house. Because they are gentle by nature, they are suitable as companions for children, and they are naturally gentle with small kids. They do tend to bark when they get excited, or when they think something is worth investigating, though, and you should always supervise time between very young children and dogs because accidents do happen.
The Shetland Sheepdog is a herder by nature, and one of the techniques they use to keep livestock in line is to nip at their heels. This isn’t an aggressive move, but even when kept as part of a family, they may adopt this technique and try to gently herd children and other pets. Early training can prevent them from heel nipping, and it will ensure a good relationship between your dog and any children in the house.
Although, or perhaps because, the Shetland Sheepdog is a natural herder, they do not instinctively attack animals. They will get along with other dogs and can normally be kept with cats and other animals in the same house. Ideally, they should be introduced to other pets gradually and on neutral territory, but where this isn’t possible, take things slowly and calmly. If you rush the early meetings, it can stress all the animals out and make it even more difficult to make good introductions.
The Shetland Sheepdog can make an excellent family companion. They are sweet, friendly, and usually get along with all family members. They do require a lot of exercise, they shed excessively, and they tend to bark, however. No breed is suitable for all potential owners, and you must choose a breed that is suitable for your living conditions, your family, and your lifestyle. Below are additional aspects of raising a Shetland Sheepdog that we think are important to know before bringing one home.
As an active dog, the Shetland Sheepdog does have quite a big appetite for a relatively small breed. Expect to feed between 1-2 cups of good quality food per day. This should be fed over two meals, and if you use treats as a means of training, remember to include this in your dietary calculations.
The breed is prone to putting on weight, so you should measure the amount of food you give each day. Look for good quality food that provides a balanced diet and fills your dog up without adding excess calories. Also look for food with a good amount of omega fatty acids, vitamin A and zinc. These are especially beneficial for dogs’ coats and will enable you to retain the beautiful shine in this breed’s luscious coat. Foods that contain fish oil, flaxseed, chicken fat, and biotin are especially beneficial for this purpose.
As with any breed, you must also ensure that your Sheltie has a constant supply of fresh water.
The Sheltie does require a lot of exercise. You should walk him at least one hour a day, ideally over two walks. This energetic breed can run for hours, and will barely need time to rest, so if you can provide more exercise than this, he will appreciate it. Agility and dog sports classes offer a great way to burn off some of that energy while socializing your dog and providing him with mental stimulation at the same time.
Agility is one way to provide socialization, and this is an important part of owning a Shetland Sheepdog. The breed is naturally shy around strangers when they first meet. As such, early training should be geared towards meeting people and putting your dog in unusual and new situations. Done smartly, this will help teach them that new people are not to be feared.
You will also want to ensure that you train your Sheltie not to nip at the heels of any children in the house, and because they tend to bark a lot, you will want to train them to limit this barking. It is acceptable for dogs to bark in certain situations, but some breeds will bark at any noise and any movement, which isn’t ideal.
The Shetland Sheepdog is a very intelligent breed and will flourish with training. Attend puppy classes when your dog is young. These not only give your dog a grasp of basic commands like “sit” and “stay” and help with recall, but they teach you how to train your dog so that you can continue the journey when you get home.
The Shetland has a beautiful coat. This coat is meant to protect them from the harsh weather conditions experienced on the remote Shetland Islands, off the coast of Scotland. It is double-layered, and it does shed throughout the year, with two shedding seasons. If your dog lives indoors, it may not experience seasonal shedding but will still lose a lot of hair throughout the year.
Although the Sheltie looks like it has very high maintenance requirements, its coat does not require much special attention. You should be prepared to brush your dog’s coat at least once, and ideally twice, a week. This will remove dead hair and it will help to prevent the coat from becoming knotted. However, you should only bathe your dog when it is absolutely necessary, and unless he is attending a show, you shouldn’t have to have him professionally cut or groomed.
Dogs do require help maintaining good dental hygiene. Starting when they are a puppy, you will need to brush their teeth three times a week, daily if they allow it without getting too stressed. This will prevent and minimize plaque and tartar. Poor dental hygiene can affect your dog’s health especially because they will eat less if it is too painful.
Finally, clip your Sheltie’s nails when you can hear that they are too long. Be careful not to cut too far, because it can cause bleeding if you cut the quick. Most dogs need their nails clipping every month, but because of the amount of running that a Sheltie does, you may only need to clip every two months, especially if they walk on concrete and other abrasive surfaces, frequently.
Generally healthy and hardy dogs, there are some conditions that the Shetland Sheepdog is prone to and that you should look out for.
Minor Conditions

 Allergies
 Cataract
 Hypothyroidism
 Patellar luxation

Serious Conditions

 Epilepsy
 Von Willebrand disease
 Deafness
 Hip Dysplasia



Male vs Female
There are no major physical or characteristic differences between male and female Shetland Sheepdogs, although some owners believe that male dogs, in general, are more dominant and territorial while also being more playful and independent. None of these characteristics are particularly prevalent in Shelties.


3 Little-Known Facts About the Shetland Sheepdog
1. Shelties are incredibly intelligent.
The Shetland Sheepdog is ranked as one of the most intelligent breeds in the world. It takes them around six repetitions to learn a new command and, as well as basic one-step commands like “sit” and “heel”, they can learn far more complex behaviors.
They are regularly used as medical assistance dogs. In this role, they monitor their owner and can recognize when their physical or mental health is taking a turn for the worse. When they spot telltale symptoms they can react by checking on the owner, fetching medicine, even calling for help, and then sitting with the person until they recover. Diabetic alert dogs, for example, can identify the scent changes associated with hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events and instruct their owner to check their blood sugar levels. They will even fetch the blood sugar monitor.
This breed may also be used as mobility assistance dogs when they are required to perform everyday tasks like fetching the paper, doing the washing, and helping their owner get around.
2. They excel at agility.
Their ability to learn and master new commands is part of the reason that the Sheltie is also considered an excellent breed for agility and sports. In fact, they positively thrive on this kind of activity. The breed requires a lot of mental and physical stimulation every day, and agility training is one way to provide all of this stimulation. They are energetic, they love to learn, and they enthusiastically want to please their owner. As well as agility courses, the Sheltie is obviously an excellent herder. The breed also takes very well to events like rally and flyball.
3. They don’t take as much grooming as you would expect.
That long hair is double layered and it does shed. In fact, it sheds a lot, and you will find that you are constantly hoovering and sweeping to clear it up. However, despite this, the Sheltie does not take as much grooming and care as you might imagine. There’s usually no need to provide regular baths, and you shouldn’t have to trim their hair too often. You will need to brush them, usually a couple of times a week because this will help minimize shedding and preventing their hair from getting knotted and matted, but this is required with a lot of other breeds, too.
 
Final Thoughts
The Shetland Sheepdog is a beautiful, sweet, and good-natured dog. But under the elegant exterior lies the beating heart of a hard-working, highly energetic, working dog. The Sheltie will run for hours without a break, tend to their flocks and keep them in line, and then dutifully follow their masters around the house when they get home. They are still used as herding and farm dogs, but this breed is also known for making an excellent family dog. If you keep Shelties as family companions, you must be prepared to provide plenty of physical and mental stimulation, but you will be rewarded multiple times over, thanks to their nature.
If you decide to bring one of these playful pups into your home you will not be disappointed. Just make sure you can provide what they need and you will have earned a friend for life.

The Shetland Sheepdog, affectionately known as the “Sheltie,” is a small to medium-sized herding breed from Scotland. Originally bred in the Shetland Islands to herd sheep, this breed retains its strong work ethic and sharp instincts. Shelties are known for their long, dense double coats, which come in various colors such as sable, black, and blue merle, often accented with white and tan markings. Regarding temperament, Shelties possess a gentle yet energetic personality, making them popular companions for families and individuals alike. They are highly trainable and thrive in active households where they can participate in activities such as obedience, agility, or simply playing with their loved ones.
One of the defining characteristics of Shelties is their high level of intelligence. They are quick learners and possess an innate desire to please their parents. Whether it’s learning new tricks or mastering obedience commands, Shelties excels in various training endeavors. Their sharp minds make them highly adaptable and capable of handling advanced tasks. They’re also ideal candidates for dog sports and competitions.
When considering a Sheltie dog, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you decide to purchase a Shetland Sheepdog puppy, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Sheltie breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The small, active Shetland Sheepdog was once a Scottish farmer’s best friend. They sounded the alarm when anyone approached the property, barking at birds and other animals to shoo them from the garden. Later, with crosses to Scottish herding dogs, they keot the sheep flocks in line.
While at first glance they look like a smaller version of the Collie, the two are distinctly different breeds. Shelties are loving companions for all members of the family, including kids, but they can be reserved or even shy around strangers. Because of their protective nature, they’re quick to bark if they sense that anything’s amiss in their territory. Training is essential to keep this trait from becoming a nuisance. On the upside, they make excellent watchdogs. You just have to teach them some discrimination.
Ask any Sheltie dog parent, and they’ll probably tell you how smart their dog is. According to Dr. Stanley Coren, an animal intelligence expert, that’s more than parental pride talking. In his studies of the intelligence of 132 different dog breeds, Shelties ranked sixth in intelligence. Shelties understand a new command after being told it fewer than five times, and they obey commands the first time given at least 95 percent of the time.
Because of their intelligence, willingness to please, and athletic ability, Shelties excel at performance events. In their size group, Shelties typically dominate the field in agility. They’re also exceptionally good in competitive obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding. In fact, Shelties have a reputation for being a little too smart for their own good. This is a breed that needs a job. Without plenty of mental stimulation, Shelties quickly become bored and will invent their own entertainment, which may or may not be to their people’s liking.
Shelties retain a strong herding instinct. You’ll find that your Sheltie will enthusiastically chase and try to “herd” squirrels, rabbits, and children, running around them, barking, and nipping. Sheltie parents should discourage this habit, especially with children, because it can lead to biting. Never let your Sheltie herd unless it’s in a herding class with appropriate subjects such as ducks or sheep. Ideally, Shelties need a fenced yard where they can play safely and be prevented from seeking out animals, people, or cars to “herd.”
Intelligent and Energetic: Shetland Sheepdogs, often called “Shelties,” are highly intelligent and energetic dogs, making them quick learners and excellent candidates for dog sports and obedience training.
Herding Instinct: They have strong herding instincts due to their historical role as sheepdogs in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. This instinct can manifest in their behavior, such as nipping at heels.
Compact Size: Shelties are a small to medium-sized breed, known for their elegant and well-proportioned build, making them suitable for both apartments and houses.
Loyal and Affectionate: They are known for their loyalty and affection towards their families, often forming close bonds with their owners.
Double Coat: They have a double coat that requires regular grooming to prevent matting and to manage shedding.
Good with Children: Shetland Sheepdogs are generally good with children, making them a popular choice for families.
Adaptable: They adapt well to various living situations and can thrive in urban or rural environments, provided they receive enough mental and physical stimulation.
Health Considerations: While generally healthy, they can be prone to certain genetic conditions like hip dysplasia, eye disorders, and thyroid issues, so regular veterinary check-ups are essential.
Longevity: Shelties typically have a longer lifespan, often living between 12 to 15 years with proper care.
The Sheltie hails from the rugged Shetland Islands, which lie between Scotland and Norway, about 50 miles north of Scotland and a bit south of the Arctic Circle. These islands are also home to other small breeds of animals, such as Shetland Ponies and Shetland Sheep. For many years, the Shetland Sheepdog was called the Toonie, taken from the Norwegian word for “farm.” Farmers bred the dogs, crossing the Border Collie with smaller dogs, to herd and protect their flocks of Shetland Sheep. Some speculate that one of the tasks of Shetland Sheepdogs was to protect the small sheep from birds. Indeed, many of today’s Shelties seem to have a passion for chasing birds, and some even try to chase airplanes and helicopters flying overhead.
In the early 1800s, the Sheltie was brought to England and Scotland, where he was described as a miniature Collie. On the Shetland Islands, the farmers started breeding their small Shelties to be even smaller and fluffier, so they could sell them to visitors to the islands.
It’s rumored that a Prince Charles Spaniel (a variety of English Toy Spaniel) and Pomeranian dogs, left on the island by tourists, were crossed with the native sheepdogs. There was so much crossbreeding that by the end of the 19th century, islanders realized that the original type of dog was disappearing. However, there was much dissension about what the original dog looked like, and how to get back to it. Some breeders believed they needed to crossbreed with Collies in order to regain the original type. Others felt that they should breed only the existing Shelties who were closest to the original type. Yet another contingent continued to crossbreed indiscriminately with other breeds to develop small, pretty pets. Shelties of all three types were entered in dog shows in the early 20th century, up to World War I.
In 1909, England’s Kennel Club recognized the breed. Altogether, 28 Shelties were registered that year as Shetland Collies (rough). Four of them still appear in the pedigrees of many modern champion Shelties: two males named Lerwick Tim and Trim and two females named Inverness Topsy and Inga. The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was Lord Scott in 1911. Collie breeders in England were unhappy about the name of the breed, however, and protested to the Kennel Club. This led to the change of the name to Shetland Sheepdog.
The Shetland Sheepdog stirred up controversy both in Great Britain and the United States for many years, with rumors of crossbreeding and long-running disagreements about what the breed should look like. As a consequence, many Shetland Sheepdog clubs were formed to support the different viewpoints. Finally, in 1930 the Scottish and English Clubs got together and agreed that the dog “should resemble a collie (rough) in miniature.” U.S. breeders imported Shelties from England until the 1950s, but by that time, American and British Shelties had begun to diverge greatly in type and size.
Today, almost all Shetland Sheepdogs in the U.S. are descended from dogs that were imported from England between World Wars I and II. As the breed became more well-known, its numbers increased in the U.S. In the 1970s, their popularity exploded and Shelties appeared on the American Kennel Club’s list of the 10 most popular dogs in 12 of the next 15 years, peaking in the early 1990s.
As of 2022, the Sheltie ranked 27th in popularity among the most popular dog breeds registered by the American Kennel Club. And how are Shelties faring in their native Shetland Islands? Ironically, they’re fairly rare in thir rugged homeland — the breed has been replaced by the Border Collie.
The Shetland Sheepdog stands between 13 and 16 inches tall at the shoulder, but it’s not unusual for them to be over- or undersized. A typical Sheltie weighs about 22 pounds.
The Sheltie is intensely loyal, gentle, and sensitive. There’s a wide range of personalities in the breed, from outgoing and boisterous to calm and sedate to shy. It’s normal for Shelties to be reserved with strangers, but steer clear of dogs that seem overly timid or nervous. If you’re choosing a puppy, it’s fine if they don’t always come right up to a stranger, but they should be happily curious and ready to make friends with someone who sits down on the floor with them.
Whatever their personality, Shelties prefer to be with their people at all times and will follow them from room to room during the course of the day. Like all dogs, Shelties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they’re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sheltie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Shelties are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shelties will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.
Although Shelties were bred to withstand harsh weather conditions, they love their people and should live indoors with them as part of the family. While they can be relatively inactive indoors, Shelties were bred to be working farm dogs and need ample exercise. They enjoy going for walks, playing fetch with the kids, and running around the dining room table. Afterward, they’ll help you hold down the sofa.
Because of their small size, Shelties can do well in an apartment if their people are committed to providing daily walks and playtime, as well as training them not to bark incessantly. This requires finesse. Shelties can have their feelings easily hurt by harsh treatment. Instead of yelling at your Sheltie for barking, acknowledge their alert (“Thanks for telling me about the squirrel in the yard”) and give a verbal reprimand only if he continues barking. In general, Shelties respond best to positive reinforcement such as praise, play, and food rewards. Try to keep training interesting for your dog. Shelties can become bored easily, and see no point in repeating an exercise multiple times if it was done correctly the first time.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 2 cups of high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.
How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don’t all need the same amount of food. An active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.
The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog. Keep your Sheltie in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day rather than free feeding.
If you’re unsure whether he’s overweight, give them the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at them. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without having to press hard. If you can’t, they need less food and more exercise.
Shelties have a double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, causing the longer, harsher topcoat to stand out from the body. The hair on the head, ears, and feet is smooth, but the mane and frill (the hair around the neck and on the forechest) are abundant. The legs and tail are furry as well. You’ll see three basic colors in the breed, all with varying amounts of white and/or tan markings:
A Sheltie who’s more than 50 percent white or who has a brindle coat won’t do for the show ring, but their color doesn’t affect their ability to be a great companion.
The Shetland Sheepdog’s beautiful coat requires, at a minimum, a thorough weekly brushing with a pin brush. Be sure to get right down to the skin, and never brush a dry coat. Use a spray bottle to mist it as you go to prevent damage to the hair. Pay special attention to the fine hair behind the ears, which tends to tangle. If you find a mat in this area early, it can usually be brushed out with a small slicker brush. Your Sheltie will need extra brushing during shedding season. Males and spayed females generally shed once a year, while unspayed females shed twice a year, a couple of months after each estrus period.
A proper Sheltie coat — a harsh outer coat and soft undercoat — sheds dirt and repels water, so Shelties need baths only when they get really dirty, which varies from dog to dog. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they’re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Sheltie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.
Dental hygiene is also important. Brush your Sheltie’s teeth at least two or three times a week to keep their breath fresh and prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease. Daily brushing is even better.
Start grooming your Sheltie when he’s a puppy to get them used to it. Handle their paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside their mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you’ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and handling when they’re an adult.
Shelties are excellent family companions, especially when they’re raised with children who know how to handle dogs respectfully. As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs. Supervise all interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent biting or ear-pulling from either party.
Never leave dogs and young children alone together. When it comes to other dogs, Shelties have a definite preference for their own kind, even if they don’t live with other Shelties. On first introduction, they seem to recognize other Shelties as kindred spirits and are usually immediately friendly and willing to play. They tend to be standoffish with new dogs of other breeds, however. They can get along with cats, once the cat puts the Sheltie in their place for trying to herd them.
People sometimes adopt Shetland Sheepdogs without a clear understanding of what goes into parenting one. Unfortunately, these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Additionally, other Shelties end up in rescue because their parents have divorced or died. If you’re interested in adopting an adult Shetland Sheepdog, a rescue group like one of these is a good place to start:
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems, and they may not socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have both health and behavioral issues.

As the breed name suggests, the Shetland Sheepdog—affectionately known as the “Sheltie”—hails from Shetland. In this Scottish archipelago, this breed was first developed as a quick, intelligent, and versatile herding dog, flock guardian, and all-purpose farm dog.
The traits that the Shetland Sheepdog was bred and valued for have been passed down through generations, and today, the breed is hailed as a sparky, energetic, and devoted family companion. Read on to learn more about this little but bighearted Scottish canine.
Height:
13–16 inches
Weight:
15–25 pounds
Lifespan:
12–14 years
Colors:
Sable and white, black white and tan, blue merle white and tan, blue merle and white, black and white, sable merle and white (AKC-standard colors but more are possible)
Suitable for:
Active and loving families, families with children and other dogs
Temperament:
Energetic, intelligent, alert, affectionate, loyal
Part of what makes the Sheltie so fascinating is that their heritage is such a melting pot. The Sheltie’s ancestors were bred from spitz-type dogs like Pomeranians and Yakki dogs from Greenland, along with spaniel types. The larger Collie is the Sheltie’s cousin, and their resemblance has led some people to wonder if the Sheltie is just a miniature Collie, but they’re two completely separate breeds.

Shetland Sheepdogs are highly energetic and active as adults, so just imagine what they’re like as puppies! These curious little fluffs are sure to want to explore everything and enjoy plenty of play sessions, so be prepared to devote lots of time and energy to your Sheltie puppy. This is also the ideal time to start training and socializing, as dogs are more likely to pick up good habits if they learn from a young age.
That said, we always urge potential owners to think about adopting rather than purchasing if possible, due to the overwhelming number of dogs in shelters. If this is something you’re willing to consider, search terms could include, “Shetland Sheepdogs/Shelties for adoption.”

Shelties are known for their lovely temperaments, family-orientedness, and trainability, but it’s essential to devote time to socializing and training your clever and lively dog. This breed typically adapts well to life in any environment—whether that’s the countryside, suburbs, or city—as long as they get enough daily exercise and mental stimulation.
Since Shelties are often so devoted and highly intelligent, they are sensitive and perceptive dogs. They pick up on everything from your mood to your tone of voice when you speak to them and can be prone to separation anxiety if not taught how to spend a healthy amount of time alone.
In addition, while Shelties usually get along nicely with kids and other dogs, they can be a little reserved around strangers due to their natural sense of alertness. This comes from their herding and guardianship background. Socialized Shelties are not at all aggressive dogs, but due to their initial unease around strangers, new people should be introduced gradually.
As long as they are properly trained and socialized and children are taught to interact respectfully with the dog, Shetland Sheepdogs are great with children—so great, in fact, that the AKC scores Shelties five out of five in its “good with young children” breed rating. The Sheltie’s loyalty and playful nature mean they often form unbreakable bonds with the young members of a household.
Yes, Shelties are known for getting along well with other dogs and cats in the household. That said, this depends on socialization and careful supervision while your furry friends get to know one another. It’s never a good idea to introduce a new pet into the household without gradually introducing them to the resident pets under close supervision.

High-quality, complete, and balanced food formulas are designed to meet all of a dog’s nutritional needs. That said, a dog’s dietary requirements can vary greatly depending on factors like health, age, and flavor preferences. Some pups can be very finicky!
Whichever formula you choose should suit your Sheltie’s age range (puppy, adult, or senior) and any health issues they may be experiencing (obesity, kidney problems, etc.). If your dog has health issues, your vet can recommend an ideal formula and may prescribe a special prescription diet. Leave clean water out for your Sheltie at all times.
Shelties have a lot of energy and need daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. Daily walks can be supplemented with other activities like play sessions, agility exercises, and obedience training. Shelties are versatile and love putting their sharp minds to work in a variety of ways.
In general, Shelties need around an hour of exercise per day, but this varies depending on the individual dog’s energy levels, personality, and any health conditions they may be experiencing. Adapt to your dog’s needs instead of going “by the book.”
Fortunately, Shelties are famed for their trainability due to their people-orientedness, adaptability, and keenness to learn. These traits have often helped them reach champion status in agility, herding, and obedience events. They tend to pick up new commands with ease, though dogs learn at different paces, so keep calm if things take a bit of time for your pup.
Remember that your Sheltie is sensitive and needs their leader to be calm and kind, as well as firm. The eager-to-please Sheltie is enthusiastic about training sessions in which positive reinforcement is front and center and in which they have an opportunity to bond with their human parents. Training also provides your Sheltie with mental stimulation, which is incredibly important for these smart dogs.
Shelties are double-coated dogs, a trait that came in handy when they were herding and guarding sheep in harsh weather conditions on the Shetland Islands. The undercoat is soft and dense, and the long outer coat has a rough texture. Having this kind of coat means that Shelties shed a fair bit, especially during shedding seasons (usually spring and fall).
You can take care of your Sheltie’s coat by brushing it weekly, but during shedding seasons, you’ll need a good de-shedding tool to tackle the mass of undercoat hair that falls out. A nail clipper is another tool to keep handy, but if you’re not comfortable occasionally trimming your dog’s nails, it’s best to go to a groomer.
Like other breeds, Shelties are prone to certain health conditions. Responsible breeders have thorough checks in place to reduce the risk of health conditions being passed down, but wherever you get your Sheltie from, it’s essential to be aware of these potential conditions just in case.
Eye conditions like Collie eye anomaly and progressive retinal atrophy are two of the conditions linked to Shelties, and they’ve also been linked to a variety of joint conditions including Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Blood disorders like Von Willebrand’s disease can also affect this breed.
Some breeders and Sheltie parents say that females often have an independent streak while males tend to be clingier and goofier, but personality depends on the individual dog, not whether they’re male or female. Females can be just as affectionate as males, and there are sure to be males with a healthy dose of independence!
Most of the differences between male and female dogs are linked to whether they’ve been spayed (females) or neutered (males). Unspayed female dogs go into heat, during which time, they can become more irritable and skittish, and they experience swelling of the vulva and vaginal bleeding.
Similarly, intact males can display heightened territorial behavior around other male dogs and engage in behaviors like urine spraying and roaming.

On the Shetland Islands, Shelties were once known as “toonie dogs,” “toon” meaning “farm.”
Shelties were bred to be much smaller than their relatives for practical reasons. Finding food on the cold Shetland Islands could be tricky, so the smaller the dog, the easier it was to feed them. This is also why Shetland ponies are so small.
Shelties are known for barking because of their history as guardians and herding dogs. Some barking is normal, but you may need to work on this with your Sheltie so it doesn’t turn into nuisance barking.

The best way to describe a Sheltie is a big ball of energy, affection, and joy wrapped in a little fluffy package. These dogs’ sweet natures and sensitivity make them delightful companions, though they can be rather vocal and easily hurt by a harsh tone of voice or feeling ignored.
It’s essential to work on building a healthy and solid bond with your Sheltie to help them develop into a well-mannered and confident individual.
