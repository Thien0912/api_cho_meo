Bloodhounds are popular with pet owners because of their incredible sense of smell and their gentle and affectionate nature. However, if you are a cat owner considering bringing a Bloodhound into your home, you may wonder whether these dogs are good with cats. The short answer is that while many are, it depends on the specific dog and cat. Keep reading as we examine the Bloodhound personality to see if they are a good fit for a household with cats and list a few tips and tricks that you can follow to help them get along better.

A Bloodhound is a large, powerful dog created to track and traverse scents. They have an amazing sense of smell, making them excellent search-and-rescue dogs and successful tracking companions when on a hunt. Bloodhounds are known for their calm and easygoing temperament and are generally friendly and affectionate with their human family members and other animals. However, like any dog breed, individual temperaments may vary. These large dogs can weigh more than 100 pounds and are usually docile and a little clumsy when not chasing a scent. Since they are a member of the hound group, they may chase after smaller animals, including cats. Early socialization can help ensure that they get along when they become adults.
Cats are independent and territorial creatures known for their agility and hunting skills. They tend to be more cautious when encountering unfamiliar animals or situations. They are highly sensitive to environmental changes and may become stressed or anxious when introduced to a new pet or living arrangement. They will often be the aggressor, especially if they are there first.
When introducing these two animals to one another, proceed cautiously, move slowly, and supervise interactions. Here are a few other tips.

Bloodhounds have a gentle and friendly nature, but their strong prey drive may cause them to chase small animals, including cats. Introducing them carefully and monitoring their interactions are crucial to prevent potential harm.
Once the Bloodhound and cat have established a positive relationship and can be trusted together, they can be left alone for short periods. However, many experts recommend gradually increasing unsupervised time and constantly monitoring their behavior for any signs of aggression or stress.
The time that it takes for a Bloodhound and a cat to get along can vary depending on their personalities and previous experiences. It may take them a few weeks or even months to establish a comfortable relationship, so patience and gradual introductions are essential.
Positive signs of a good relationship between a Bloodhound and a cat include relaxed body language, mutual curiosity, and playfulness without aggression. They may also groom each other or share sleeping spaces. However, addressing any issues or seeking professional guidance is vital if there is excessive fear, aggression, or avoidance behavior.
Bloodhounds make great pets, and they are quite friendly and often patient with children and other pets. Many will have no problem getting along with cats, but they are hunting dogs, and some will have a strong prey drive that causes them to chase after small animals, including cats. Gradual, supervised introductions and plenty of early socialization with cats and other animals can help them get along better as adults, and it will make it easier to bring new pets into your home.

The inspiration for the phrase “nose like a bloodhound,” comes from these large, wrinkly hounds, famous for their ability to relentlessly track the scent of missing or fugitive humans. Bloodhounds are the most efficient finders of people. No modern technology yet invented is as sensitive or accurate as the nose of a Bloodhound.
Height:
23 – 27 inches
Weight:
80 – 110 pounds
Lifespan:
10 – 12 years
Colors:
Black and tan, liver and tan, red
Suitable for:
Individuals or families who don’t mind drool and appreciate vocal dogs
Temperament:
Friendly, independent, inquisitive, tolerant of children and other pets, single-minded when following a scent
When not tirelessly following a scent, however, Bloodhounds are sweet-tempered, docile dogs who enjoy the company of humans and other dogs. While they do present some challenges, Bloodhounds can make wonderful companions for the right family or individual. Read on to learn more about the Bloodhound and to help decide if this is the breed for you!

Be sure you are purchasing a puppy from a reputable breeder rather than a pet store or a puppy mill. The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a good place to start your search for responsible breeders. Local veterinarians or other Bloodhound owners may also be able to point you to a breeder. Responsible breeders will always ensure puppies are vet-checked and that their parents are healthy and free from known health conditions.
If you prefer to adopt rather than purchase a Bloodhound, look for Bloodhound-specific rescue groups in your area. The cost to adopt a Bloodhound varies by rescue group but will almost certainly be less than the cost of purchasing a puppy. While it’s not impossible to find Bloodhound puppies available for adoption, it’s more likely to be adult dogs who find themselves in need of a new home, something to consider as you decide whether to buy or adopt a Bloodhound.

Bloodhounds are typically friendly, social, and tolerant dogs with a strong stubborn streak. They are not considered the most intelligent of dogs, not necessarily because they aren’t smart, but because they are independent and relentless when trailing a scent. Bloodhounds are smart enough to find and follow a scent for miles and sometimes days on end but they also probably aren’t going to pay any attention to commands while doing so.
Bloodhounds get along well with children and are known to be quite tolerant of them. Because they are a large and sometimes clumsy breed, they should be supervised with smaller children in case of accidental knockdowns and the like. Bloodhounds are social dogs who prefer to be involved in the family rather than relegated to outdoor living. Families who want to share their home with a Bloodhound should be aware that the Bloodhound is a drooler, because of their long jowls. Bloodhounds may also display common hound traits like loud baying and a doggy odor.
Because they were originally bred to work as part of a pack, Bloodhounds usually get along well with other dogs. Early socialization is important, especially with smaller dogs who occasionally may be viewed as prey. Some Bloodhounds can be aggressive to other dogs of the same sex.
Bloodhounds can get along with cats, especially with early socialization. Like smaller dogs, cats can sometimes be a bit too prey-like to safely live with Bloodhounds, so some caution is in order. Smaller pets such as rodents and birds should be kept away from Bloodhounds.

Here is some basic information on what is required to successfully and properly care for a Bloodhound.
Bloodhounds should be fed a high-quality, nutritionally balanced diet either commercially prepared or homemade. If you choose to feed a homemade diet, be sure to consult your veterinarian for help making sure it is properly balanced. Make sure you feed your Bloodhound the correct food for their age, whether puppy, adult, or senior. Like most hounds, Bloodhounds love to eat, so you will need to carefully monitor their weight and adjust their food intake accordingly.
Although Bloodhounds are often thought of as lazy dogs who sleep on the porch all day, they were bred to tirelessly follow a scent for miles on end and are more active than is commonly assumed.

A post shared by Hank (@_hankthebloodhound_)

Bloodhounds require daily exercise, either a walk or safe play in an enclosed area. They should always be kept on a leash when not within an enclosure as they will take off after an enticing scent no matter where it may lead them. A fenced yard is ideal as a safe play space but make sure the fence is high and sturdy enough to contain a large, strong, and escape-prone Bloodhound who will also attempt to dig their way to freedom if given the opportunity.
There’s really no way around the fact that Bloodhounds can be challenging to train. While they are devoted and docile dogs, their independence and stubbornness make patience and skill a must for successful training. Getting an early start to socialization and training will yield the best results as Bloodhounds tend to get set in their ways and bad habits can be hard to break. Bloodhounds like to be in charge, so firm, consistent handling is important. They will do best with positive training, full of rewards. Just make sure to keep an eye on your dog’s weight if you find that treats are their preferred reward.
Bloodhounds are a short-haired breed but they do shed, usually once or twice a year. Weekly brushing will help keep the amount of hair in your house to a minimum. Bloodhounds do require regular bathing to keep their doggy odor at bay. Keep the Bloodhound’s floppy ears clean to help prevent infection. As with all dogs, the Bloodhound’s nails should be kept trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.
Male Bloodhounds are usually noticeably larger than females. It is also reported that females tend to socialize more easily than males and that they have a longer attention span. These characteristics may make female Bloodhounds a bit easier to train than males.

While not created directly by a deity, Bloodhounds were first developed by prominent members of medieval religious orders. About a thousand years ago, monks in Western Europe carefully bred and maintained large packs of Bloodhounds on the grounds of their monasteries.
Unlike other hound breeds like the Coonhound or Otterhound, Bloodhounds aren’t named after what they hunt or track. The name “Bloodhound” comes from the term “blooded hound,” used to describe the dogs bred by the monks. During that time in history, the term “blooded” referred to being of noble or aristocratic blood, which is how the early Bloodhounds were perceived.
No, they don’t have to swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth (their handlers take the oath instead), but Bloodhound tracking evidence is often admissible in a court of law. The handlers must provide proof of the dog’s pedigree and training for their evidence to be accepted. Some states are more skeptical than others, but quite a few do allow Bloodhounds to serve as witnesses for the prosecution, so to speak.

As you have seen, Bloodhounds can be big, lovable companions with the right mix of training, socialization, and living situation. Wrinkly, mournful-faced Bloodhound puppies are hard to resist but keep in mind that puppy will grow into a large, stubborn adult dog with a penchant for drooling. Make sure you do your research and try to spend some time around adult Bloodhounds before you decide to bring a Bloodhound pup into your family. If you do decide this is the breed for you, hide all your stray socks, fortify your backyard fence and make sure you work with a responsible breeder or rescue group to choose your new companion.

The Bloodhound is a distinctive breed known for its incredible sense of smell and tracking abilities. Originally bred for tracking game, Bloodhounds are often used in search and rescue operations and have a reputation for being excellent scent hounds. Here’s an overview of the Bloodhound, including its characteristics, temperament, health, and more:

Physical Appearance:

Temperament and Personality:


Friendly and Gentle: Bloodhounds are known for their gentle and friendly disposition. They tend to be affectionate with their families and can be good with children.

Sociable: Bloodhounds are generally sociable and can get along well with other dogs and pets, especially when properly socialized from a young age.

Strong Instincts: They have strong instincts for tracking and can become easily distracted by scents, making training a challenge.


Exercise and Activity Needs:


High Exercise Requirements: Bloodhounds require regular exercise to maintain their physical health and mental well-being. Daily walks, playtime, and opportunities to explore outdoors are important.

Tracking and Scent Games: Activities that engage their sense of smell, such as tracking games or scent work, can provide both physical and mental stimulation.


Training and Socialization:


Positive Reinforcement: Bloodhounds respond best to positive reinforcement training methods. Using treats and praise helps encourage desired behaviors.

Early Socialization: Early and ongoing socialization is essential for Bloodhounds to become well-adjusted adults. Exposing them to various people, pets, and environments helps them develop good manners.

Bloodhounds date back to a seventh-century Belgian monk but they began to be developed in Britain some 500 years later to hunt rabbits, wild boar and deer. Described as “a nose with a dog attached”, they have 230 million scent receptors while humans have five million. This has lent them extraordinary scenting abilities which, coupled with a high prey drive, has made them highly prized as one of the best dogs for tracking.
Bloodhounds have also proven to be very useful in helping to track people – be it for work or sport – and they have an entry in the Guinness World Records as the first animal whose evidence is legally admissible in some US courts. But although their working credentials are in no doubt, bloodhounds have also found their way into homes as family pets. One for you? Let’s take a look at this beautiful scent hound.
Bloodhounds need between an hour and two hours of exercise each day and you should certainly give them as much as you possibly can. Without exercise and mental stimulation, they can rapidly become bored and put on weight but the good news is that you don’t need to engage in high-level activities.
Gentle exercising will more than suffice – and is, indeed, recommended to prevent putting pressure on their joints. Combine a walk with plenty of opportunities to sniff around and engage their mind with tracking games or a spot of hide-and-seek. Ideally, you would also have a large yard or a safe place for them to go off-lead to run and play.
Bloodhounds can be among the biggest barkers – in terms of volume, anyway. They have a loud, deep bark and they also howl and whine, but they tend to only do so if they feel distressed in some way.
There are steps you can take to make life easier and more pleasurable for both you and a bloodhound.
“Bloodhounds require good socialization from an early age, which should help to reduce the risk of them barking at new people, objects, and animals,” explains vet Dr Rebecca MacMillan.

You should also be aware that bloodhounds can suffer separation anxiety.
“Training them to feel comfortable in their own company is important,” Dr MacMillan adds. “Separation anxiety is a behavioral problem that could lead to excessive barking and howling if you leave them in the house alone. By getting your dog used to being by themselves, gradually and from a young age, you can reduce the risk that they will become upset if you need to leave them.”
Bloodhounds are among the smartest dog breeds according to the American Kennel Club and much of that is due to their tracking abilities. It means they are both easy to train yet easily distracted if they suddenly catch a scent so you need to patient, start as early as possible and quickly instil basic obedience during short training sessions (they don’t have long attention spans).
With lots of positive reinforcement – being sure to never allow treats to make up more than 10% of a Bloodhound’s calorie intake – you’ll soon find they become confident and willing dogs. You should also consider learning how to crate train a dog because you need to steer bloodhounds away from following their instinct to wander by giving them their own designated den. And if you let them out in the yard to train, ensure it’s well enclosed to prevent them digging or jumping out.

As pack dogs, bloodhounds love being around other people and that includes children and other pets. You’ll find they are tolerant and patient as well as being one of the more mild-mannered and calm dog breeds. Even so, there is a little bit of work to be done.
“Bloodhounds aren’t aggressive but can be a bit nervous so careful introduction to children and other pets is required,” says Dr MacMillan. “If this is done from an early age with plenty of positive experiences your bloodhound should make a good family dog. I find them to be generally calm and gentle dogs, but their size can make them clumsy around very small children.”
Bloodhounds have a short, dense coat and they need minimal grooming.
“The main thing to keep an eye on is their skin folds,” says Dr MacMillan. “Make sure that these folds are regularly cleaned and dried to avoid skin infections developing.”
Another thing to consider, depending on how sensitive you are to such things, is a bloodhound’s tendency to drool – as they are definitely a breed that drools. Grab a towel to clean up their jowls and that’ll help if they’re about to sling!
“Also check that the loose folds of skin around their neck are not getting moist or sore,” says Dr MacMillan. “If your dog suffers from skin or ear infections, your vet will be able to advise you on a suitable grooming regime and products.”
Bloodhounds are active dogs but they don’t need huge amounts of food. A couple of meals each day made up of a high-quality diet packed with animal-based proteins and a good mix of vegetables, carbohydrates and vitamins and minerals will suffice so just aim for the best dog food.
There are a few common health complaints that you need to be aware of with bloodhounds and one – which is rather common across many breeds – is hip and elbow dysplasia.
“These hereditary conditions affect the development of the joint, leading to joint pain and lameness,” says Dr MacMillan.
Since they have large ears, they can trap moisture and warmth in the ear canal, causing yeast and bacteria to thrive when there is no circulating airflow, causing inflammation, pain, and discharge so that’s certainly something to watch.
“Bloodhounds are also prone to skin allergies and ear infections, so they may require regular treatment for these issues,” Dr MacMillan adds.
There’s also a serious condition to be aware of.
“Being a large, deep-chested breed makes Bloodhounds more likely to suffer from gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) than some other dogs. This is where the dog’s stomach bloats and twists on itself, which could be fatal.”
Bloodhounds are very rewarding pets particularly for owners and families who are very active. So long as you train them well and early, ensure they are socialized and don’t leave them alone for many hours, you will have few problems. Their affectionate, gentle nature is sure to win you over and it’s fun to watch their single-minded determination on a scent trial.
