If you're considering bringing a Bernese Mountain Dog and a cat into your family, it's essential to understand their unique needs and personalities.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are gentle giants, known for their calm and patient nature, which makes them a great match for families with cats.
However, as with any large breed dog, they do require regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behavior.
A daily walk of at least 30 minutes is recommended to keep your Bernese Mountain Dog happy and healthy.
The Bernese Mountain Dog is a gentle giant, typically standing between 23 and 27.5 inches tall.
Their thick, medium-length double coat requires regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling. This breed can weigh anywhere from 70 to 115 pounds, making them a substantial addition to any family.
Their lifespan is relatively short, ranging from 7 to 10 years, so it's essential to cherish the time you have with them.
The Bernese Mountain Dog is a majestic breed with a sturdy build. They typically stand between 23 to 26 inches tall, with females being on the shorter end of that range.
Their weight can vary, but you can expect females to weigh between 70 to 95 pounds, while males tend to be a bit heavier, weighing between 80 to 115 pounds.
Their thick, medium-length double coat requires regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling. It comes in a variety of colors, including black, rust, and white, or black, tan, and white.
Despite their large size, Bernese Mountain Dogs are known for being gentle and even-tempered, making them a great addition to families. They're also extremely loyal, always happy to be by your side.
Originating from Switzerland, this breed has a long history of being a working dog, used for tasks such as herding and drafting.
The Bernese Mountain Dog has a rich history that spans thousands of years. They originated in and around the Swiss city of Berne, with genetic ties to the Roman mastiff.
Their ancestors were used by dairy farmers to pull carts, herd animals, and serve as guard dogs. These tasks required strength and intelligence, which the Bernese Mountain Dogs possessed in abundance.
The breed's popularity waned with the modernization of farms, but breed enthusiasts stepped in to save the day. Professor Albert Heim, a renowned European dog expert, created the first breeding club for the Bernese Mountain Dog.
In 1926, two Berner pups were welcomed into a Kansas farm, marking the breed's debut in America. Their popularity grew quickly from there.
The American Kennel Club officially recognized the Bernese Mountain Dog breed over a decade later, in 1937.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are known for their gentle nature and eagerness to please, making them excellent house dogs. They're highly trainable, and with proper socialization, they can be open to meeting strangers and are quite affectionate with their families.
Their intelligence and trainability make them a joy to work with, but their size means they can accidentally knock over a child or adult if they get too energetic. They're not the right breed for you if you work long hours and expect a dog who can remain happily alone at home.
Here are some key characteristics of Bernese Mountain Dogs at a glance:
Bernese Mountain Dogs are known for their gentle nature and eagerness to please, making them excellent house dogs. They thrive on attention and affection from their families, and can become destructive if left alone for too long.
These intelligent dogs are highly trainable, but require thorough obedience training in puppyhood to prevent unwanted behaviors. With consistent training, they can excel in various dog sports and activities.
One of the most distinctive characteristics of Bernese Mountain Dogs is their thick coat, which sheds heavily and requires regular grooming. This makes them a great choice for outdoor enthusiasts who live in cold climates, but may not be ideal for those with allergies or a preference for low-maintenance grooming.
In terms of exercise, Bernese Mountain Dogs need regular physical activity to stay happy and healthy. They require at least a medium level of exercise, which can be achieved through daily walks, playtime, and outdoor activities.

Here's a summary of the key characteristics of Bernese Mountain Dogs:
Bernese Mountain Dogs are generally gentle with children, making them a great option for families with younger kids. However, their large size and energetic nature can make them a challenge to manage, especially for new dog owners or elderly people.
The Bernese mountain dog is a large breed, with males typically growing between 25 to 27 ½ inches and females growing between 23 to 26 inches at full size.
Their weight can vary, but they usually range from 70 to 115 pounds, depending on their diet and exercise level.
These dogs have a beautiful, silky, tri-colored coat of black, white, and rust with distinctive markings and dark eyes.
Their long, thick hair results in very high amounts of shedding, so consistent grooming and maintenance are a must to manage the shedding.
You'll likely find some dog hair throughout your home and on your belongings, and those with allergies to dog hair should consider looking into alternatives.
Be prepared for some slobber, as Bernese mountain dogs are predisposed to drooling, and you may find yourself wiping their face every once in a while.

Fresh water should always be available for your Bernese Mountain dog, and selecting a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet is essential. This is especially crucial for Berner puppies, which require a diet made for large breeds to prevent joint problems and other issues.
Feeding your dog twice a day is a common practice, but it's essential to discuss the diet and quantity with your veterinarian to ensure your dog is eating properly. They can help you determine the best feeding schedule for your dog.
Using slow feeder bowls instead of elevated bowls can help prevent bloat, which is a significant risk for large breed dogs like Bernese Mountain dogs.

Bernese Mountain Dogs are naturally relaxed around other pets, including cats, dogs, and farm animals. They're not inclined to cause conflict or chase small animals.
These gentle giants are ideal family pets, rarely aggressive and patient with small children. They can handle roughhousing, but it's essential to teach kids to treat them gently.

Supervise interactions between Bernese Mountain Dogs and other pets, especially when introducing a new furry friend to the household. This will help you understand their temperaments and ensure a harmonious household.
If you have other pets, like dogs or cats, Bernese Mountain Dogs are unlikely to act aggressively towards them. However, they may enjoy chasing small mammals, like squirrels or raccoons.
If you're considering bringing a Bernese Mountain Dog into your home, you'll want to know that they have a good-natured personality, making them excellent house dogs.
Their gentle nature and eagerness to please mean they thrive on attention and affection from their family, and they're quite trainable, too. With proper socialization, they can be open to meeting strangers and are quite affectionate with their families.
However, Bernese Mountain Dogs don't like to be left alone for too long, so they're not the best fit for busy owners who work long hours. They require regular interaction and exercise to stay happy and healthy.
When introducing a Bernese Mountain Dog to your family, it's essential to teach your young children to treat the dog gently and supervise interactions between them.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are rarely, if ever, aggressive, making them ideal family pets. They have plenty of energy and patience around small children.
Roughhousing is a natural part of childhood, but it's crucial to teach your kids to be gentle with your Berner. This will help prevent accidental injuries to both the child and the dog.
Bernese Mountain Dogs can handle their fair share of roughhousing due to their robust nature, but it's still important to supervise interactions between children and dogs.
Owning a dog is a big responsibility, and it's essential to consider the costs involved. You can expect to spend around $1,000 to $2,000 per year on food, vet bills, and other expenses.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are large dogs, so they need plenty of space to move around. A house with a big yard is ideal, but a small yard or even an apartment can work if you're willing to take them on regular walks.
Their thick coats require regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling. Brushing them daily can help prevent these problems and keep them looking their best.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are intelligent and trainable, but they can be stubborn at times. Consistent training and positive reinforcement are key to developing good behavior.
Their calm and gentle nature makes them great family pets, but they can be wary of strangers and may take time to warm up to new people.
To introduce a dog to a cat safely, start by providing a dog-free sanctuary for the cat and gradually introduce them in a controlled environment, beginning with basic commands and face-to-face meetings. Follow a step-by-step process to ensure a smooth and stress-free introduction.

The Bernese Mountain Dog is a truly loveable breed, most recognized for its large size and friendly personality. This is the “gentle giant” of the dog world, and they are as loving as they are large! They may look intimidating, but they are very affectionate and welcoming dogs when it comes to you and your family, and they’re usually friendly toward strangers as well.
This breed’s size is indicative of the room they’ll need to feel most comfortable. Although they will love spending time with their owners, they’ll also be happiest with large yards where they can run and play. Because they were bred as working dogs, they’ll enjoy keeping a close watch over your home as well.
If you’re looking for a dog that is emotionally attached and affectionate but can also protect you and your home, the Bernese Mountain Dog may be for you — as long as you can handle their size. We’ll go over everything you need to know below so you can decide if this is the breed for you.
Bernese Mountain Dog puppies are adorable balls of fluff, but don’t be fooled into taking home more than one! This breed is named the tenth-largest dog breed according to the American Kennel Club, and they often grow to be more than 100 pounds. Those little fluffs can quickly become massive, powerful dogs that can be physically hard to control on walks, so just one will do.
This dog was bred as a working breed, specifically for pulling carts and herding cows, and as watchdogs. They’re extremely alert and will let you and everyone in the neighborhood know if they think there’s any kind of threat to you or your property. This, combined with their size, means they aren’t suitable for apartment dwellers or for those who can’t handle some loud barking from time to time.
Despite their strength and girth, these are very sensitive dogs who don’t deal well with negative reinforcement. They’ll seek to please any owner who establishes themselves as a leader, but their feelings will get hurt if they’re reprimanded or spoken to in a negative tone.

Bernese Mountain Dogs are known to be one of the friendliest breeds around, and their attitude and gentleness with children only serve to support that reputation. Not only will these dogs be gentle with kids, but they’re also very tolerant of children who may play too roughly. They somehow know that kids need a little more patience than other humans.
Perhaps the best part about how these dogs interact with kids is how they’ll protect them. Many breeds are protective sometimes to a fault, but Bernese Mountain Dogs are usually very good at assessing if something or someone is a real threat, so you won’t have to worry about your dog attacking a child’s friend during a playdate.
One of the most joyous things in the world is a puppy acting like a puppy, and with this breed you’re in for some extended puppy time! Bernese Mountain Dogs may grow physically into full-grown dogs quickly, but their minds are slower to mature than with other dog breeds.
This is not to say your pup won’t be intelligent, because they will. The quintessential puppy behavior that we all know and love will just be extended and enjoyed longer. They’ll be playful and somewhat mischievous, and they’re not quick to lose interest in games like keep-away and being chased.
These dogs originated somewhere in the 18th century when they were bred as working dogs to work on farms pulling carts, herding, and protecting crops. When alternative breeds became available to the Swiss farmers which brought them to popularity, this breed nearly became extinct.
Thankfully, a small group of Swiss people sought to preserve the breed, and we owe them for their popularity again today. It’s likely that the decline in numbers led to many of the Bernese Mountain Dog’s health issues, as rebuilding the population meant pulling from a small gene pool. Even so, this dog remains a popular breed today after nearly being lost altogether.
The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, lumbering pup that has as much love in their hearts as they do fur on their large frame. They are very affectionate dogs that love cuddling and human interaction, and they’ll always love being around you and your family.
They are regarded as one of the friendliest dog breeds out there. Whether you’re introducing your pooch to close family, distant relatives, other dogs, or complete strangers — as long as there is no obvious threat — your dog will enjoy pets and play with just about anyone. Expect your Bernese Mountain Dog to be a big, emotional, and sensitive mush.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are excellent family dogs, as they carry a lot of affection and love that will happily be shared with anyone in your house. This includes people of all ages, including children, and this breed’s friendly nature will extend to strangers they meet on walks, at the dog park, and anyone coming to visit.
These dogs are big babies and love human interaction, so the more people you have around, the happier they will be! In fact, these dogs crave attention and company more than anything else, so whether they’re relaxing inside, playing outside, or keeping watch of your property, they’ll always be happier if someone is around. So, these dogs are not suitable for homes where they will be left alone for long stretches of time, so if you and everyone in your household works or goes to school, you’ll want to consider a more independent breed.
Bernese Mountain Dogs also have big personalities. They are often goofy and playful, and they enjoy being the center of attention. They’re likely to become key parts of your family dynamic and will bring a lot of joy to everyone in your household.
These pups are usually as good with other dogs as they are with strangers. You won’t often see a Bernese Mountain Dog being unfriendly or aggressive toward any other animal. They also don’t have a high prey drive, so they’re unlikely to chase a cat or other small animal around or lunge at squirrels or rabbits when outside. As long as your other pet is okay with your big lumbering pooch, the interaction between them should be positive.
It’s important to remember the size of these dogs, especially in relation to other animals you may have. A Bernese Mountain Dog will happily play with other pups and even cats if the other animal is willing, but you should watch to make sure things don’t get out of hand accidentally. There isn’t a malicious bone in this breed’s body, but sometimes they don’t know their own strength!
These dogs eat large quantities, and they eat often. Be prepared to feed your furry friend about four to six cups of food every single day once they’re fully grown.
The diets of many dog breeds change from puppyhood to adulthood, and this is particularly true of this breed. Until they reach about six months old, you’ll want to feed your pup three times a day and about a cup at each feeding. From six months to about eight months you can decrease the frequency to twice a day and up each feeding to about two cups each. Finally, between eight months and a year old they can be fed once per day, but their serving should be between four and six cups of food. Speak with your vet multiple times in the first year to ensure your pooch is growing at a healthy rate and getting all of the nutrients they need.
You should only feed your pup a high-quality dog food that’s rich in protein and will help them grow properly. Be careful not to overfeed, as this breed is prone to several joint issues that can be made worse by weight gain beyond their healthy weight.
Although these dogs are gentle giants, they’ll still need a good amount of exercise each day to stay healthy and to maintain their weight. You should set aside at least an hour of vigorous exercise or an hour and a half of normal exercise every single day for your dog. These dogs have a lot of energy, and if you commit to this breed you need to dedicate a lot of time to getting that energy out!
As a large dog breed, Bernese Mountain Dogs are prone to issues like bloat. This can be a life-threatening issue where the stomach fills with gas and turns over on itself. While there is no guaranteed way to avoid bloat, but not exercising your pup right after drinking large volumes of water or after feeding can help prevent it. You were told as a child not to swim for thirty minutes after eating — give your dog a similar amount of time and up to an hour after eating or drinking before going for a walk or playing outside.
Lastly, exercising as a puppy is important and healthy, but given that this breed is prone to joint issues you should avoid play or exercise on hard surfaces as much as possible. Take your pup to the yard for play or to a field or dirt trail for walks until they’re about two years old.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are intelligent and usually eager to please their owners, which means that they are fairly easy to train. They will pick up on commands quickly and will learn tricks with ease.
However, these dogs need a leader that will teach them how to behave. If these pups aren’t treated with positive authority they will become the masters of their own behavior, and with a 100+ pound dog, that’s the last thing you want!
If you don’t have experience with leading and training a dog, you should seek out a trainer to help you establish the leadership these pups need while maintaining a happy and healthy relationship with your dog. With the right kind of owner who is willing to lead and guide, the Bernese Mountain Dog will be very open to training and learning new tricks and commands.
This breed has medium-to-long length hair that is very dense, so be prepared for weekly brushing to avoid it becoming matted or tangled. You’ll also want to keep up with weekly brushing to cut down on shedding and subsequent vacuuming. You won’t avoid shedding entirely though, as this breed sheds regardless of the season.
The good news is that you won’t need to bathe your pup too often — once a month or even once every other month should be plenty. Once you get your mammoth of a dog in a bathtub or kiddie pool, you’ll be thankful that bathing is infrequent!
You should keep your dog’s nails trimmed and ears cleaned as well to avoid cracked or broken nails as well as ear infections. Bernese Mountain Dogs are also prone to tooth and gum issues, so prepare to brush your pup’s teeth every other week or so to help limit issues. Getting them teeth-cleaning toys or treats can also help you keep up with their dental hygiene.
Speaking of dental hygiene, you should also be prepared to wipe slobber off of your dog’s chops often. This breed drools quite a bit, and while wiping their mouths a few times throughout the day won’t limit dental problems, it will keep the slobber off of your floors.
Unfortunately, this breed is prone to a myriad of health problems, several of which are very serious and life-threatening in some cases. You should plan on frequent vet visits with this kind of dog, and you should always be mindful of the below health issues.
Minor Conditions

 Obesity
 Epilepsy
 Eye problems, including retinal atrophy

Serious Conditions

  Hip dysplasia
 Bloat
 Organ damage
 Tooth and gum problems
 Cerebellar abiotrophy


 
Male vs Female
Male Bernese Mountain Dogs are usually larger and can easily top 100 pounds, while females will usually be under this weight and a bit shorter. Both genders are equally as likely to be affectionate, energetic, and loving. You may find that males are a bit more alert and protective of your home. For the most part, temperament in this breed isn’t dependent on their sex.

Bernese Mountain Dogs are wonderful companions for families and singles that have time, attention, and affection to give. These dogs love being around their humans, so they’re the perfect companion dog that will stick by you no matter what.
These dogs are large and strong, but they’re also gentle and abundantly friendly toward most people they meet, family and strangers alike. They’re moderately active, and they have an appetite that will put any other dog’s food intake to shame.
Although these dogs, unfortunately, have one of the shortest lifespans of any dog breed and are prone to some pretty serious health issues, the love and adoration you will get from a Bernese Mountain Dog will make the absolute best of the years they do spend by your side. If you’re looking for a big mush of a pup who will bring you a ton of joy, happiness, and laughs, the Bernese Mountain Dog may be the perfect companion dog for you!

One of the Sennenhund-type dogs developed in the Swiss Alps, the Bernese Mountain Dog is a large breed that originated in Bern, Switzerland. They were developed from Roman Mastiffs as alpine herding dogs and general farm dogs, as well as draft animals.
Now, the Bernese Mountain Dog is in use as a herding or livestock guardian dog, competition dog, or beloved family pet. These dogs have a lot of excellent traits for a variety of pet owners, but there are some things to be aware of before you bring one home.
Height:
23–27.5 inches
Weight:
70–115 pounds
Lifespan:
7–10 years
Colors:
Black, rust, and white; black, tan, and white; black and rust; black and white; rust and white
Suitable for:
Active families, those looking for a low-shedding dog
Temperament:
Single owners, active owners, active families, cold climates
Bernese Mountain Dogs are good all-around farm dogs, but one of their unique historical uses was as a draft animal. With their imposing size and strength combined with a calm temperament, Bernese Mountain Dogs are natural at pulling small carts or wagons. This use arose in Switzerland, but these dogs are often trained to give children rides or pull carts in parades. Carting competitions are common for this breed.

Although they’ve been around for a while, Bernese Mountain Dogs are among the rarer breeds. They are growing in popularity, however, so more breeders are cropping up throughout the U.S. Since these dogs are prone to certain health problems, including joint issues and possible behavioral problems with irresponsible breeding, it’s crucial to work with an ethical breeder committed to pairing healthy, well-tempered dogs.
You may find Bernese Mountain Dogs in rescues or shelters. People may surrender these dogs if they grow too big or require more work than they can provide. You’re less likely to come across Bernese pups in a shelter environment, however.

Bernese Mountain Dogs are bred to be docile, aloof, confident, and well-mannered. As livestock guardians, they’re supposed to hold back unless they need to intervene, such as protecting a herd from a wolf or protecting an owner from an attack. These dogs get along well with families and other pets, but they require a lot of exercise and enrichment to stay happy and avoid destructive or nuisance behaviors.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are calm and gentle with children, leading to their use as cart animals. They are affectionate and tolerant, even allowing children to climb on them. However, it’s important to teach your kids to behave appropriately with these dogs, due to their size, and always supervise interactions.
Bernese Mountain Dogs were developed as farm dogs and tend to be relaxed around livestock, other dogs, cats, farm birds, and all types of animals. These gentle giants aren’t inclined to cause conflict or chase and kill small animals like some other working breeds. Individuals can have different temperaments, however, so it’s best to supervise interactions until you know all your pets get along.

If you’re considering a Bernese Mountain Dog, here’s everything you need to know before bringing one home.
Bernese Mountain Dogs need high-quality food to support every stage of their development and encourage healthy growth. It’s important not to overfeed these dogs, as excess weight can contribute to joint problems and other health problems. Be sure to consult with your vet about your dog’s body condition and diet.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are outdoor dogs bred to patiently watch cattle, only moving quickly in response to a threat. They need some activity and exercise, but they lack the endurance of some of the hunting and working breeds. You don’t need to spend hours exercising the Bernese Mountain Dog, but they will need regular walks or playtime to avoid boredom and problem behaviors. These dogs make great hiking partners or canine competitors in agility, herding, obedience, or rally sports.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are intelligent and eager to please. Start with obedience and socialization training early to help a puppy grow into a well-adjusted adult. Despite their size, Bernese Mountain Dogs are gentle, sensitive dogs that don’t respond well to harsh training methods. Positive reinforcement engages the dog’s natural desire to please and gets better results.
As one of the Sennenhund types, Bernese Mountain Dogs are designed to thrive in cold climates. They have a thick double coat with a wooly undercoat and thick topcoat. They shed all year round and seasonally, so they require regular brushing to remove loose hair. Bernese Mountain Dogs also need their nails trimmed, their ears cleaned, and their teeth brushed as needed.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are prone to the same conditions as other large breeds, including bloat and cancer. However, they have an unusually high rate of musculoskeletal conditions, including arthritis, hip dysplasia, cruciate ligament rupture, and osteochondritis, which often strike at a young age and affect mobility. Otherwise, these dogs may have problems with their vision and heart.

There’s no significant difference in the temperament of the male vs. the female Bernese Mountain Dog. The males are usually larger, which can add to your food and vet expenses with an already large breed. It’s important to spay or neuter your Bernese Mountain Dog to prevent some problem behaviors and eliminate the risk of reproductive cancers, such as mammary cancer, in this vulnerable breed.

During their work as farm and cart dogs, Bernese Mountain Dogs were used to transport carts of milk and cheese for dairy farmers. They eventually earned the local nickname, “Cheese Dogs.”
Bernese Mountain Dogs began showing locally in the early 1900s, leading to a group of Burgdorf breeders founding the first breed club: the Schweizerische Durrbach-Klub. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Bernese Mountain Dog in 1937 within the Working Group.
Stella, a Bernese Mountain Dog in Plymouth, Michigan, is a local celebrity. She has two restaurants named after her, Stella’s Black Dog Tavern and Stella’s Trackside, as well as a book titled. “Introducing Stella.”

A loyal and gentle giant, the Bernese Mountain Dog has a long history as a steadfast and versatile farm worker.

The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large working breed from the canton of Bern in the Swiss Alps and one of the four Sennehund, or Swiss Mountain breeds. Known for their distinctive tricolor coat of black, white, and rust, these fluffy, gentle giants weigh between 70 and 115 pounds. They are known for their calm and affectionate temperament, earning them a reputation as devoted family companions. Bernese Mountain Dogs are also intelligent and relatively easy to train, making them well-suited for active families with children. They were first bred to pull carts, herd livestock, and protect their families from predators. Although they were first brought to the United States in the 1920s for farm work, today, this devoted breed serves as a working dog, therapy dog, service animal, and companion.
Before bringing home a Bernese Mountain Dog puppy, take a moment to do some research on this breed’s predisposition to health conditions and shortened lifespan. Because of the dedicated efforts of breed conservationists, the Bernese Mountain Dog lifespan has increased by a few years. Still, it’s worth noting they face the highest risk of canine cancer compared to other dog breeds. Sadly, the Bernese Mountain Dog’s life expectancy is only six to eight years.
Prioritize adoption from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you’re searching for Bernese Mountain Dog puppies, choosing a reputable breeder is crucial. Conduct thorough research to ensure the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The Bernese Mountain Dog, affectionately called the Berner (known as the Berner Sennenhund in their Swiss homeland), is instantly recognizable with their flashy, tricolor coat and white “Swiss cross” on the chest. Underneath that beautiful coat is a sturdy dog well suited for heavy work: These beautiful, gentle dogs have traditionally been used as herders and draft dogs in Switzerland.
The Berner was originally a vital part of farm life, driving cattle, protecting family, and pulling carts loaded with goods to sell at nearby villages. Although they’re good-mannered, hard workers, they nearly became extinct in the early 20th century, when other means of transportation became accessible to farmers. Fortunately, a handful of fanciers sought to preserve the breed.
In addition to being strikingly good-looking, the Berner has a wonderful temperament. They’re known for being loyal, affectionate, eager to please, and intelligent. They’re easy to train if you allow them time to analyze what you want them to do. Most of all, they have a happy-go-lucky attitude about life.
The Berner is calm but gregarious and sometimes even a little goofy when playing with family. They do well with children of all ages and with adults, but they aren’t a good choice for people who live in apartments or don’t have a large, fenced yard for them to play in. The Berner needs to live with their family rather than be relegated to an outdoor kennel. They’re happiest when they can participate in all family activities.
Since they were bred to be working dogs, the Berner likes to learn and can be easily trained. Early obedience training and socialization are recommended since they are very large—usually about 100 pounds—when mature. Prospective owners should know that the Berner is slow to mature physically and mentally; they may remain puppyish for some time. Additionally, the Berner is known to have a “soft” personality; their feelings are easily hurt, and they don’t respond well to harsh corrections.
Despite their beauty and excellent temperament—or perhaps because of these qualities—Berners often have a short life span. The breed has a small gene pool, which has resulted in numerous health problems related to inbreeding. As more people learn about the breed, many dogs with health problems are being bred with little or no regard for the effect this has on the breed as a whole.
Appearance: Bernese Mountain Dogs are striking with their large, sturdy frame and striking tricolor coat. They have a rich black base with rust and white markings, including a white blaze on their face, a rust “mask,” and rust paws. Their thick, double coat provides warmth and protection in cold climates.
Gentle Nature: Berners are known for their gentle and affectionate nature. They are often referred to as “gentle giants” due to their large size combined with their kind and loving disposition. They are patient and good with children, making them excellent family pets.
Loyal and Protective: These dogs are fiercely loyal to their families and have a protective instinct, making them excellent watchdogs. While they are generally not aggressive, their size and protective nature can deter potential threats.
Working Heritage: Bernese Mountain Dogs have a strong work ethic, originally bred as working dogs in the Swiss Alps. They were used for pulling carts and as farm dogs; some of that work ethic remains in their DNA. They enjoy being given tasks and participating in activities with their owners.
Health Considerations: Unfortunately, Bernese Mountain Dogs are prone to health issues, including hip and elbow dysplasia, certain types of cancer, and bloat. Prospective owners should be prepared for potential veterinary expenses and invest in regular check-ups and preventive care.
Short Lifespan: One of the downsides of this breed is its relatively short lifespan, typically 7 to 10 years. Consider this when deciding to bring a Bernese Mountain Dog into your family.
One ancient breed, the Molosser, stands out as one the most versatile, well-traveled, and influential in the development of a variety of Mastiff-type dogs, including Berners. It’s thought that the four Swiss Sennenhund breeds (Appenzeller Sennenhund, Entlebucher Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, and Berner Sennenhund) developed as crosses between farm dogs from the Swiss Alps and the Molosser or Mastiff-type dogs that the Romans brought with them when they invaded the Alps in the first century B.C.
It’s likely that Bernese Mountain Dogs have been working on Swiss farms for more than 2,000 years, quietly tucked away on small holdings in the Alps. They’ve pulled carts, accompanied livestock, stood watch, and provided owners with loyal companionship. By 1888, only 36 percent of the Swiss population worked in agriculture, and the need dwindled for a strong dog who could herd cattle and pull a cart filled with goods.
During World War I, dog shows and breeding took a backseat to war efforts. But after the war, the first Bernese Mountain Dogs were exported, first to Holland and then to the United States—although the American Kennel Club did not yet recognize the breed.
In 1936, two British breeders began importing Berners, and the first litter of Berner pups was born in England. The same year, the Glen Shadow Kennel in Louisiana imported a female and a male Berner from Switzerland. By early 1937, the AKC sent Glen Shadow a letter saying that the Bernese Mountain Dog had been accepted as a new breed in the Working Class.
World War II again interrupted the breed’s progress outside its native land, but after 1945, importation and registration resumed in the United States. 1968 the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America was founded, with 62 members and 43 registered Berners. Three years later, there were more than 100 members in the club.
Meanwhile, the breed, which had died out in England during World War II, was reintroduced in Great Britain. The Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America became a member club of the AKC in 1981. In 1990, the AKC adopted its current Bernese Mountain Dog standard.
Male Bernese Mountain Dogs, on average, stand 25 to 28 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 80 to 115 pounds. Females stand 23 to 26 inches tall and weigh 70 to 95 pounds. Individuals of the breed may be smaller or larger.
The Berner is an affectionate, intelligent, and alert dog. They’re also gentle, calm, and tolerant. They like to be with family and thrive when included in family activities. Their large size is one of his most notable features, and of course, early training is essential to teach them how to behave properly in the house and with people.
Slow to mature, Berners reach adult size long before they reach mental maturity. Though they aren’t usually aggressive, Berners are protective of family. They can be aloof with strangers and generally a bit shy, so it is important to expose Berner puppies to a wide variety of people, animals, and situations.
Socialization helps ensure that your Berner puppy grows into a well-rounded dog. Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors regularly and taking your pup to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help polish their social skills.
Bernese Mountain Dogs sometimes have health issues due to irresponsible breeding. Not all Berners will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.
Berners are not suited to apartment or condo life. A home with a large, securely fenced yard is the best choice. Because the Berner is a working dog, they have plenty of energy. In addition to yard play, they need a minimum of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise daily; three times that amount keeps this sturdy dog in top condition.
With their thick, handsome coat, the Berner is a natural fit for cold climates. They love to play in the snow. Conversely, with his black coat and large size, they’re prone to heat stroke. Don’t allow them to exercise strenuously when it’s extremely hot; limit exercise to early mornings or evenings when it’s cooler. Keep them cool during the day’s heat, either inside with fans, air-conditioning, or outside in the shade.
You’ll need to take special care if you’re raising a Berner puppy. Like many large-breed dogs, Berners grow rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.
A Bernese Mountain Dog diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Bernese Mountain Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.
The Berner coat is gorgeous: a thick double coat with a longer outer coat and a wooly undercoat. Characteristically tricolored, the majority of the Berner’s body is covered with jet-black hair with rich rust and bright white. There’s usually a white marking on the chest that looks like an inverted cross, a white blaze between the eyes, and white on the tip of the tail.
Beauty has a price, though; in this case, it’s that the Berner is a shedder. They shed moderately all year and heavily in the spring and fall. Brushing several times a week helps reduce the amount of hair around the house and keeps the coat clean and tangle-free. Periodic bathing every three months or so will maintain their neat appearance.
Brush your Berner’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.
Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn’t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. They’re too long if you hear them clicking on the floor. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far, you can cause bleeding. Your dog may not cooperate the next time it sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you’re not experienced in trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.
The ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, indicating an infection. When you check your dog’s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don’t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.
Begin accustoming your Berner to being brushed and examined when they’re puppies. Handle their paws frequently—dogs are touchy about their feet—and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you’ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they’re adults.
As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, nose, mouth, eyes, and feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Berner is an excellent family pet, and they’re usually gentle and affectionate with children who are kind and careful with animals. Being so large, they can inadvertently bump or knock over very young or small children.
As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while eating or sleeping or try to take the dog’s food away.
No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Berner gets along with other pets well, though the greater the size difference, the more supervision and training are required to keep everyone safe.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Berners in need of adoption and or fostering, and a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don’t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Berners rescue.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.Conversely, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems or socialize their puppies properly, so puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health and behavioral issues.
The Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America can help you find a reputable breeder.
