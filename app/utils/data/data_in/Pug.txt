An ancient breed in Asia probably as far back as 400 to 700 B.C., Pugs share an ancestor with the Pekingese and resemble the Peke, but without the long coat. The largest of the toy breeds, Pugs were highly prized by Tibetan monks and Chinese royalty and have varied in size throughout their history. Traders brought Pugs to Europe, where they gained great popularity in the 15th century. Called “Mopshond” in Holland, “Carlin” in France, and “Dutch Pug” or “Dutch Mastiff” in England, the name “Pug” is probably a reference to marmosets – popular monkeys often called Pug monkeys in 18th century Europe – which they resemble. Beloved companions in the U.S. since their introduction in the 19th century, Pugs today rank as the 13th most popular breed.
The Pug's motto,multum in parvo, means “a lot in a little,” and that refers not only to a stocky, heavily-built toy breed, but also to the Pug's great big personality. No hyperactive ankle-biter, the Pug has a stable and noble way, befitting a much larger dog. On the other hand, Pugs can get pretty free-spirited and playful…in short bursts. They enjoy romping with children, get along fine with other pets, and make wonderful companions for seniors, singles, or anyone who has time to spend with them. Athletes can look elsewhere for a running partner, however – the Pug's heavy bones and flat face make him intolerant to heat and unable to run fast or far.
When it comes to training, Pugs can be, well... a little pugnacious. Sure, they want to please you, but they also like things a certain way and would rather charm you out of your silly ideas about “fetching” and “lying down” and “coming when called” than actually do those things. Try to force them, and they'll resist. The key to training a Pug is with lots of rewards and encouragement for good behavior. When they misbehave, ignore them – the ultimate punishment – until they decide to make the right choice, then offer plenty of praise and attention. Housetraining takes a similar degree of patience and consistency; taking the dog out at the same times every day without fail will speed up the process.
Pugs don't have much hair to brush, but the way they shed, it can seem like they do. Daily brushing helps keep Pug hair out of the house. Even then, Pug owners often find themselves vacuuming daily and keeping a lint brush in their back pockets. The Pug's deep facial wrinkles and delicate eyes also need to be kept clean and dry. Gently wash the Pug's face and facial wrinkles daily, drying thoroughly. Brush the Pug's teeth and clip nails about once a week. Bathe every month or two with a hypo-allergenic shampoo made for dogs. Pugs don't tolerate heat well and are prone to heatstroke. They must be kept cool in warm weather and shouldn't exercise outside in high humidity.
Pugs snore and snort a lot, and while this is normal for the breed, talk to a veterinarian if your Pug seems like it is having trouble breathing. Like most toy breeds, Pugs can develop luxating patellas (kneecaps that slip out of place), and can also be prone to other orthopedic problems like degenerative hip disease and misshapen spinal vertebrae. Other health problems Pugs sometimes develop include encephalitis (an inflammatory brain disease), epilepsy, eye problems like dry eye and eyeball dislocation, skin infections, and mast cell tumors (a type of cancer common in dogs). Talk to your breeder and your vet about these issues.

Pugs are one of the most beloved and affectionate dog breeds in the world. Known for their cute wrinkly faces, short muzzles, and charming personalities, Pugs make excellent companions for families, singles, and seniors alike. But owning a Pug is more than just falling in love with their adorable looks — this ancient breed has unique characteristics, care needs, and health considerations every owner should know.
In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into everything about Pugs — from their history, appearance, temperament, to health issues, and care tips to help them live a long and happy life.
The Pug is an ancient breed that originated in China over 2,000 years ago. These small dogs were bred to be companions of Chinese emperors, and their presence in royal courts is well-documented. It’s said that their name might derive from the Chinese character for "prince" due to their royal history.
The breed later made its way to Europe through traders from Holland, where Pugs became favorites of the royal families. Queen Victoria was particularly fond of Pugs, and she helped popularize the breed in England. Even Prince William of Orange is known to have kept Pugs. Today, these dogs remain cherished around the world for their loving and loyal nature.
Pugs are compact, small dogs with a lot of personality packed into their stocky bodies.
Height: 10 to 13 inches (25–33 cm)
Weight: 14 to 18 pounds (6–8 kg)
Their short, smooth coat comes primarily in fawn, black, silver, and apricot. Regular weekly brushing helps control shedding, although Pugs do tend to shed year-round.
Pugs are famous for their flat faces, large round eyes, and short muzzle, which give them that characteristic "worried" yet endearing look. Their wrinkled skin folds require special attention to prevent skin problems and infections.
They have soft, button or rose-shaped ears, and a tightly curled tail that usually sits over their back.
Pugs are known for their affectionate, playful, and friendly nature. They are often described as "shadows" because they tend to follow their owners everywhere.
Affectionate and love cuddling.
Good with children and other pets, including other dogs and cats.
Adaptable to new situations, making them excellent family dogs.
Naturally social but may show stubbornness during training.
Although Pugs bark, they are not overly yappy compared to some small dogs, but may alert you when strangers are near.

Because of their short muzzle and flat faces, Pugs are prone to breathing problems, including loud breathing, breathing difficulties, breathing noises, and snoring. This condition, called brachycephalic airway syndrome, makes them sensitive to hot weather and humid weather.
Breathing problems and overheating — always ensure they have air conditioning or cool spaces.
Eye problems (due to protruding eyes).
Skin fold infections — wrinkles must be cleaned regularly.
Obesity — Pugs love eating and are prone to weight gain, requiring a balanced diet and limited treats.
Parvo and other common puppy diseases — ensure vaccinations are up to date.
Pugs live around 12 to 15 years with proper care.
Because of potential health issues, veterinary costs for Pugs can be high. Consider pet insurance to help manage unexpected expenses.
Weekly brushing to control shedding.
Daily cleaning of skin folds to prevent infection.
Regular ear cleaning, teeth brushing, and nail trimming.
Pugs require high-quality dog food suited for small dogs to avoid obesity. Work with your vet to determine the right portions based on age and activity level. Watch their treat intake and avoid feeding from the table.
Although Pugs enjoy walking, avoid strenuous exercise, especially in hot or humid weather, to prevent breathing difficulties. Short, gentle walks are ideal. Rest periods are crucial to prevent overexertion.
Pugs are intelligent but sometimes stubborn, so positive reinforcement with treats, praise, and patience works best. Early socialization with other dogs and people helps prevent behavioral issues.
Be consistent and use positive methods.
Reward desired behaviors immediately.
Pugs tend to seek human approval, so training with affection and patience is effective.

Affectionate and loyal companions.
Great with children and other pets.
Adaptable to small living spaces like apartments.
Comical personalities that bring joy to any house.
Prone to health issues like breathing problems, eye problems, and skin problems.
Shed quite a bit despite their short coat.
Stubbornness can make training a challenge.
Sensitive to hot weather and humid weather.
Pugs are an ancient breed with roots in ancient China, favored by royalty.
Queen Victoria had a profound love for Pugs, helping them gain popularity in Europe.
Pugs are known as the comedians of the dog world due to their playful antics and funny expressions.
Pugs were once used as guard dogs for royal palaces—despite their small size!
Absolutely! Pugs are affectionate and gentle, making them ideal for families with children and other pets.
Depending on the breeder and location, a Pug puppy can cost between $1,200 to $3,000. Always choose a responsible breeder to avoid inherited health issues.
Pugs tend to bond deeply with their owners and don't like being left alone for long periods. They can develop separation anxiety if left alone too often.
Pugs are prone to breathing difficulties, eye problems, skin fold issues, and obesity. Regular vet check-ups and a healthy diet are essential.
Pugs are loving, loyal, and incredibly charming dogs that fit perfectly in a family setting or with a single owner. However, their health concerns require attention and care. If you can provide a safe, cool environment, proper training, and regular vet care, a Pug will reward you with years of affection and companionship.

Due to the reproduction of increasingly ‘exaggerated’ dogs (their muzzles increasingly flat), dogs of this breed are born with obvious impediments, given their heavy respiratory problems.
In this small hound, the condition causes quite significant snoring and a very loud sound as he breathes. This is mainly due to the narrowing and tightness of the nose. This may look amusing, but it is the result of a real malformation, caused by the unscrupulous efforts of some breeders to produce more and more pug-like pugs.
The pug’s heritage is ancient: he was created and bred in China (and was particularly valued among mandarins), but he is also very popular in Holland and England. These two nations have each claimed to be the creators of the race on the basis of the very good selection work they have done over many years. Finally, Britain prevailed and the paternity of the pug breed was attributed to those troubled isles. The pug may have experienced difficult times over the years, but today he is celebrated for his true value; however, potential owners should give serious thought as to whether they wish to encourage the breeding of these troubled brachycephalic beings.

Section 11 : Small Molossian type Dogs
The pug is a particularly friendly dog, very attached to his masters and fond of everyone. As long as he is the centre of attention, he feels good.
This little hound is a real clown who loves to amuse the audience. He can get along very well with children since he likes to play and ‘make jokes’. He is very playful so he will delight both the young and old.
The pug puppy’s behaviour can be somewhat turbulent but he is calm once grown.
This small dog’s intellectual capacity is well-known but often too little exploited. He is very docile and he understands what is expected of him if we take the time to teach him properly.However, his stubbornness has been known to stand in the way of him completing tasks as instructed.
The Mops, as he is adorably known in Germany and Poland, has no predatory instinct. If he encounters what he might consider a prey, he will show himself to be indifferent, somewhat intrigued and curious but never predatory.
This dog is neither fearful nor aggressive when around strangers; he welcomes them enthusiastically, especially if they spoil him with treats and a fuss. However, if people do not show him any interest, he is quite prepared to ignore them.
It is only with his masters that this small format hound will be happy. He is very attached, sometimes overly so, to his social group. In fact, the risk of developing hyper-attachment is very much present.
The Pug is not a great loner, he lives very poorly in the absence of his masters and vindictively when they return. The ideal scenario for him is to be always surrounded by his masters at home or for them to take him everywhere.
This dog is, against all odds, and contrary to common belief, easy to educate! You just need the right attitude and patience to get results.
Education should be firm and constant to compensate for his occasional stubborn side but you must never be brutal. Since he is very sensitive, the Pug needs an education based on respect of the principles of positive education: the reinforcement of good deeds and not the systematic sanction of the bad ones.
Finally, it is important to note that despite the small size of this dog, he must complete his schooling if he is to fit in to society.
In fact, small dogs are often not educated as much as large ones simply because the consequences of poor education are considered to be less dangerous. Regardless of what you have heard, this is incorrect and early education must be put in place, no matter the size of the dog.
Very discreet; the pug barks very little. He may be noisy at the arrival of guests but not to excess.
He is very attached to his master but also to his comfort, and thus this little hound prefers not to move away from his family cocoon. To find himself alone outside would be the worst thing that could happen to him.
The pug puppy can be wild and therefore sometimes destructive. His misbehaviour is often linked to his emotional discomfort when he finds himself alone.
He has a fairly greedy nature, so the Pug is not shy about making requests. This is why you must be careful of his weight.
However, this gluttony makes the dog easy to educate with the help of treats that can promote his concentration and develop his motivation to cooperate.
This dog is not very protective, and his looks are by no means a deterrent despite his pugilistic appearance; plus he will be friendly with anyone who offers him a minimum of attention. So please, do not rely on him to protect the house.

The city life, in an apartment, perfectly fits this little hound. The Pug is an indoor dog who will not be able to live outside. The exterior and the weather we find there are not made for this sturdy but sensitive little dog.
In addition, this dog is very attached to his comfort. He only appreciates cosy places and he will not be satisfied with a mere patch of carpet placed in a corner of the living room. Garden-based lodgings are out of the question.
Anyway, his low energy expenditure makes him a perfect dog for apartment life. A few outside walks a day will meet his needs, aerate his spirit, and stretch his paws to his satisfaction.
Very little to not-at-all athletic; there’s no hope of running a marathon with a pug given the risk of losing him along the way!
It’s best to look at him as the team coach, because the Mops does not need much exercise to be fulfilled. Combine outdoor hygiene breaks with indoor play and the tutelage of tricks to satisfy his limited need for energy expenditure.
Moreover, since he is brachycephalic, the main reason for keeping him in an apartment is to avoid breathing problems. In fact, any intense physical activity must be avoided.
The pug’s modest silhouette makes him a dog that you can take everywhere fairly easy, especially with the help of a pet carrier/bag.
However, the breathing difficulties that the Pug suffers are sometimes incompatible with certain trips: especially when it is hot or involves air travel for example.
The dog’s attempts to regulate his temperature in unfamiliar climates could lead to his premature death.
This dog gets along perfectly with cats; he will show himself indifferent sometimes, while other times he will be playful.
The arrangement will be harmonious as long as the two subjects grow up together.
Pay attention to the possibility of aggressive reactions toward cats (he can scratch their eyes or muzzles). And keep a particular watch out for acts of retribution from his feline companion.
As he doesn’t consider himself to be a small dog, the Pug will get along with other dogs. However, it will be necessary to ensure that large dogs are not too abrupt with him.
Early socialisation is necessary so that the Pug puppy and his peers can live as serenely as possible. In order to do so, regular, controlled, and friendly meetings will have to be arranged with his contemporaries.
A very playful being, this dog likes to amuse his audience, especially children with their tendency to provide him the attention he requires. This is a dog that will be able to integrate into a family with children without problems.
His need to be surrounded, his hatred of loneliness, and his moderate need for physical exercise are all aspects of the pug that correspond in every respect to the everyday life of an elderly or sedentary human.
This dog is a perfect candidate for a first adoption: he has a good personality, his needs are not expensive, he is docile, affectionate and particularly sociable. These qualities make him a perfect companion dog, compatible with many different profiles.
The price of a pug varies depending on his origins, age and gender. An average of £850 is to be charged for a dog registered with Kennel Club.
The monthly budget allocated to the maintenance of the Pug is between £20 and £30 depending on the quality of the food chosen and taking into account occasion of his various annual treatments (vaccines, deworming, etc.).
Average
This dog loses his hair continuously throughout the year. The rate of this loss is moderate but more intense during the moulting period in the autumn and spring. During moulting, brushing should be completed daily to remove dead hair.
The maintenance of this small hound is not difficult but requires a certain regularity. His coat should be brushed weekly to maintain its brightness. In addition, special attention must be paid to his eyes, ears and the wrinkles of his nose.
The lifespan of the pug is estimated at 13 years.
The chunky aspect of this hound could be interpreted as robustness, but this small dog is somewhat delicate, mainly because of his flattened snout.
However, besides this anomaly - a real complication in the pug’s life - the creature rarely falls ill.
Brachycephalia (flattened snout) is a cause of many respiratory complications. This dog does not have the same capacity as others to regulate his body temperature when he is hot.
When temperatures rise, Pugs are not able to sweat. Because of his flattened muzzle, it takes a more substantial effort to keep himself cool.
This dog does not have a thick undercoat to withstand the weather (cold, humidity). So he should never be left outdoors in such conditions. During winter walks, even the wearing of a coat may not be enough to protect his skin.
The unlimited appetite of this well-padded little dog can lead him to become much fatter than he should be. Even though he should not be skinny, neither should he be any rounder than necessary.Be careful to feed him a diet adapted to the physical condition of his breed.
Oh no... 
 There are no Pug adoption profiles at the moment...
