Greyhounds of all sizes have been depicted on walls and in tombs since ancient times. The miniature version of the breed was developed to perfection in Italy. Many royals found the exquisite little dog irresistible.
Italian Greyhounds are usually submissive to other animals and very willing to please their humans. They should be socialized early and often. Cats and other fleet-moving creatures are too great a temptation. Loving to their own people ‚Äì they cannot tolerate being left alone for long periods and are most willing lapdogs. They love climbing to the tops of furniture to watch their surroundings or lying on window benches to catch the sun.
The Italian Greyhound is slim and trim, with a long tail, folded ears, and a smooth coat. She looks like a miniature version of the Greyhound. Almost any color is acceptable and likely to be found, either as solids or with white markings. They have large, dreamy eyes, able to see at great distances and to steal your heart. Italian Greyhounds have a distinctive high-stepping gait and are light on their feet.
They do well in obedience and agility, when the sighthound's need for speed is taken into consideration. Use positive training with lots of praise. Make training techniques more enticing and interesting than the surroundings.
Smooth with a hound's glove or soft brush and very little shedding will take place. Nail trim, and that's it! Care should be taken that tails and legs are away from doors before shutting. Breeds like Italian Greyhounds are why doggy coats and sweaters are made. They cannot tolerate cold weather and hate getting wet!
Like most breeds, Italian Greyhounds are predisposed to certain conditions through genetics, including patellar luxation, eye problems, some autoimmune diseases and seizures. Search for healthy parents with OFA and CERF certification.

A sighthound in a small package, the Italian Greyhound shares the characteristics of the larger versions. This little dog loves to run and chase but has a super sensitive disposition. They are clean, gentle, and shy, and love to snuggle because they are affectionate and trying to keep warm. They can be shy around strangers to the point of disinterest but are devoted to their families and get along well with kids, other dogs, and pets in their familial unit. Since they're so small, they can easily get hurt by rough play with kids or bigger dogs.
The Italian Greyhound has been around for centuries. There is evidence of similar dogs in art from nearly 2,000 years ago in Turkey, Greece, and around the Mediterranean. By the Middle Ages, these miniature Greyhounds were popular in southern Europe, especially among Italian courtiers. They arrived in England in the seventeenth century and became favorites of the nobility, peaking in popularity during Queen Victoria's reign. After World War II, the breed nearly vanished in England, but by that time they had appeared in America and risen in popularity.
They are small in size, but Italian Greyhounds don‚Äôt necessarily know it. They are capable of chasing and running as fast as their bigger counterparts, but they are small and delicate, so much so that they require a wardrobe of clothing to keep them warm and protected. They love to burrow into warm bedding and blankets, so owners will need to be ok with finding them buried in the covers. They do best in child-free, quiet homes.
Tiny sighthounds, they love the thrill of the chase. It's best to let them run in a safe, confined space since they can dart off and are too delicate to play with rough or bigger dogs. They can be fragile going up and down stairs.
The Italian Greyhound can easily live in a small house as long as they have a safe place to run and plenty of covers to burrow in.
These delicate pocket pups need very little coat care for their short coats. A rub down with a cloth will bring out the natural shine in their coats. Owners should focus on keeping teeth clean as Italian Greyhounds are prone to dental problems.
An Italian Greyhound sees training as beneath them, so it will be up to owners to instill good training practices such as walking on a leash and good recall because they are prone to darting off, chasing neighborhood cats on instinct. Potty training can be a slow process and they often have separation-related behavior issues because they are so tightly bonded with their owners.
Italian Greyhounds generally do not make great family dogs as they are too delicate and sensitive for even the quietest of families. They usually bond exclusively with one person.
The cost of an Italian Greyhound from a breeder is significantly more than the cost of adopting one from a local shelter or rescue. The adoption fee usually covers additional items such as spaying or neutering, vaccines, and microchipping.
