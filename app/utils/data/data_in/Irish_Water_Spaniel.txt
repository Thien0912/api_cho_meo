However, Irish Water Spaniels are a distinct dog breed and always end up having a special place in people’s hearts. These loyal dogs often form strong bonds with their families and value companionship. We’ll go over all you need to know about Irish Water Spaniels and if they’re a good fit for you.

Irish Water Spaniels are the oldest and largest of the spaniel breeds. However, they have mysterious origins, and no one is quite sure of what dog breeds were involved in developing them. What we do know is that Irish Water Spaniels were bred for hunting and retrieving. They’re natural swimmers that have webbed feet, dense waterproof coats, and a hairless tail that functions like a rudder when they’re swimming.
Irish Water Spaniels also have gentle and laidback personalities. While they love participating in outdoor activities, they’ll love lying on the couch with you and relaxing in the evening. Although they were originally bred for hunting, they’re also excellent companion dogs.

Irish Water Spaniels aren’t a common breed in the US, so it can be challenging to find a breeder near you. You can start your search by looking through the American Kennel Club’s (AKC) Marketplace or the Irish Water Spaniel Club of America’s (IWSCA) breeders’ directory. Because Irish Water Spaniels are uncommon, you’ll rarely find one at a dog adoption center. It’s more likely that you’ll find mixed-breed dogs that have Irish Water Spaniel in their lineage.
As puppies, Irish Water Spaniels are playful and affectionate. They enjoy being around people and are quick to build trust with their family members. Irish Water Spaniel puppies are particularly curious and will end up following their noses and snooping around all areas of the house. Therefore, it’s important to puppy-proof your home thoroughly and supervise your Irish Water Spaniel puppy at all times. Crate training your Irish Water Spaniel puppy will ensure they’re kept in a safe space during times you can’t keep an eye on them.
While Irish Water Spaniels tend to be non-aggressive dogs, it’s important to start socializing your puppy as early as possible. Irish Water Spaniels tend to prefer human company and are usually confident and social when meeting new people. However, they can be shyer around other dogs. Introducing them to friendly and gentle dogs at an early age can help them build their confidence and learn to behave appropriately when interacting with other dogs.

While Irish Water Spaniel puppies can be very energetic, they usually mellow out once they reach adulthood. They calm down a lot and have gentle and easygoing personalities. Irish Water Spaniels are particularly excellent pets for people who enjoy spending time outdoors. They love being outside and have fun when engaging in activities like hiking, camping, and swimming. They’re also adequate jogging companions.
Irish Water Spaniels form strong bonds with their families and don’t do well if they’re left alone for too long. They love human companionship and do best when they’re in homes where someone is usually around to be with them.
If you work long hours outside of your house, it’s essential to schedule moments of human interaction throughout your Irish Water Spaniel’s day. You may have to take them on walks during your lunch break, hire a dog walker, or drop your dog off at a doggy daycare.
Although Irish Water Spaniels are intelligent, they’re not often recommended for first-time owners. They can have a stubborn streak, especially during the beginning stages of obedience training. However, with some patience, Irish Water Spaniels are usually won over and become eager to please and very responsive to praise and rewards.
These smart dogs tend to enjoy having a job or a hobby. They can be good service dogs and therapy dogs, as they like feeling helpful and enjoy being around people. Due to their athleticism, they’re good candidates for dog sports and can excel in various sporting events, including agility, rallying, and dock diving.
Irish Water Spaniels are gentle and easygoing, which makes them good family dogs. They tend to show a good amount of patience toward children and are highly loyal to their families. Irish Water Spaniels love being included in family activities and would love nothing more than going on a road trip or camping trip with their families.
No matter how laidback an Irish Water Spaniel is, it’s still important to teach both the dog and children how to interact with each other appropriately. Irish Water Spaniel puppies may come off a bit strong with their enthusiasm and playfulness, which can be intimidating for younger children. They may also be mouthy and nip while they’re going through their teething phase. Children must also learn how to handle and pet dogs respectfully. It’s important for them to know not to touch a dog’s face, paws, or tail and when a dog wants to be left alone.
Irish Water Spaniels are people-loving dogs, but they can live harmoniously with other dogs in the house. Early socialization will help immensely with Irish Water Spaniels getting along with other canine siblings. A slow and gentle introduction process will also help them get used to living with another dog.
Irish Water Spaniels can learn to live with other types of pets. If you’re careful with your introductions and supervise initial interactions, they can learn to leave cats and other smaller pets alone. It can take several weeks to a few months, but most Irish Water Spaniels eventually get used to other animals and won’t bother them. However, it’s still important to remember that they were originally bred to be hunting dogs. Some Irish Water Spaniels will have a strong prey drive.  So, owners must also have realistic expectations and come to terms with the fact that their Irish Water Spaniel may not ever be fully trusted to be left unsupervised and alone with smaller pets.

The best way to determine the best diet for your Irish Water Spaniel is to consult your veterinarian. Their nutritional needs will depend on a variety of factors, including their life stage and activity level. Finding the right dog food and portion sizes is particularly important for Irish Water Spaniels because they’re prone to excessive weight gain.
In most cases, Irish Water Spaniels will do well with eating high-quality dog food without any special formulas. However, if your dog is particularly active, consider choosing a high-protein diet to help sustain their energy needs. Irish Water Spaniels are also prone to developing joint dysplasia as they age. So, make sure to have a conversation with your veterinarian about when it would be appropriate to change their food or add joint health supplements to their diet.
Consistent exercise is particularly important for Irish Water Spaniels because they’re prone to obesity. They have moderate exercise needs and require at least 45 minutes of exercise a day. They’ll enjoy going on long walks but usually prefer roaming around off-leash. Therefore, they thrive in homes with a spacious fenced backyard where they can run and sniff around. It’s possible to live with an Irish Water Spaniel in an apartment, but it’s important that they have consistent and daily access to a dog park where they can let loose and explore.
You can also help Irish Water Spaniels burn some energy by planning weekend excursions for them. They’re outdoorsy dogs and will be enthusiastic about going hiking or spending the day at a dog beach. If you don’t live near a dog beach or a hiking trail, you may want to teach your Irish Water Spaniel how to participate in dog sports. Irish Water Spaniels are eager learners and typically enjoy racing through an agility course. They also usually like fetching, retrieving, and swimming.
As smart dogs, Irish Water Spaniels love a good intellectual challenge and will thrive when they have enrichment activities scheduled in their daily routine. They’ll love solving dog puzzles and playing with treat-dispensing toys. You can also encourage them to utilize their powerful noses by playing hide-and-seek or hiding treats around the house for them to find.
Irish Water Spaniels may take some time to get used to obedience training, but they usually grow to become enthusiastic learners. They’re intelligent dogs and pick up on obedience commands pretty quickly.
When training an Irish Water Spaniel, it’s important to keep training sessions fun and positive because they’re very sensitive to people’s tone of voice. They respond very poorly when spoken to harshly, and it’ll be detrimental to their confidence and self-esteem. Therefore, if you ever feel frustrated during training sessions, it’s best to walk away and resume training later when both you and your Irish Water Spaniel are feeling calmer.
Keep training sessions short and schedule them multiple times throughout the day. This will keep your Irish Water Spaniel engaged during training sessions and will help them remember obedience commands more easily.
Irish Water Spaniels require a more extensive grooming routine than many other dogs. They have a low-shedding coat that needs to be brushed frequently to prevent mats and tangles from forming. Their hair is prone to tangling and brushing it every other day will keep it smooth and healthy. You can also have a professional groomer trim their coat every 6–8 weeks. A shorter coat can make grooming much more manageable, and you can get by skipping a day of brushing if you’re too busy.
Irish Water Spaniels don’t require frequent baths. It’s best to bathe them only when they start to smell or get particularly dirty, as overbathing can make their skin dry out and cause skin and coat issues. Just make sure to check their ears and clean them regularly. Their long ears are prone to gathering and holding moisture, which is the perfect condition for ear infections to develop.
The average lifespan of Irish Water Spaniels is 12–13 years. They’re relatively healthy but can be susceptible to a couple of health issues as they age. Here are some health issues that are commonly found in Irish Water Spaniels.

Male Irish Water Spaniels tend to grow a few inches taller than female Irish Water Spaniels and are usually heavier. Other than size, there aren’t any known differences attributed to the breed’s sex. Some people may believe that male and female Irish Water Spaniels have distinct personality traits and temperaments. However, this theory has insufficient evidence and is yet to be proven. A dog’s temperament is more likely to be influenced by genetics and environment.

Irish Water Spaniels are the tallest among the spaniel breeds, and many people often mistake them for Poodle mixes due to their large size. They also have curly hair, narrow noses, and floppy ears that look similar to Poodle features.
Irish Water Spaniels may have had Poodles introduced to their lineage long ago, but both breeds are considered to be distinct from each other and unrelated.
Irish Water Spaniels go by many other names, including Bog Dogs, Rat Tail Spaniels, Shannon Spaniels, and Whiptail Spaniels. They’ve also earned the moniker of being the clowns of the spaniel breed. It’s unclear as to when and how they got this nickname, but many people attribute it to their playful personalities, atypical coats, and rat-like tails.
Despite having a reputation for being clownish, the Irish Water Spaniel was a prized gift to French royalty. King James I gave an Irish Water Spaniel to the king of France as a diplomatic gift, and this dog was the first Irish Water Spaniel to enter and live in France.

Irish Water Spaniels are charming dogs, and it’s so easy to love them. They’re devoted and loyal to their families, and they have a goofy and playful personality that’ll bring a smile to your face. It may take some time to earn an Irish Water Spaniel’s trust, but the time and effort you put into gaining their trust is well worth it. Irish Water Spaniels have a lot of love to give, and they’ll be happy to be by your side and create many new and fun memories in their lives with you.

Nicknamed the clever clown dog, the Irish Water Spaniel is fun-loving and mischievous. Few people know about the Irish Water Spaniel because the only time that one has won the prestigious title of Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club’s annual dog show was Ch. Oak Tree’s Irishtocrat in 1979! Often confused for a large and pampered Poodle, the Irish Water Spaniel is nothing of the sort. He is a formidable hunter, pointer, swimmer and retriever as well as an awesome family companion.

The Irish Water Spaniel has such a friendly and inquisitive outlook on life that he tends to be quite the source of entertainment for all who are around him. Toys thrown across the yard will immediately have him off running but… if a butterfly flutters by, he will stop for a second and seemingly enjoy its beauty. Like a light bulb turning on, he will quickly divert his attention to a toy, grab it and bring it right back as if the butterfly never appeared. They are pleasant dogs and a joy to be around. For more information about the Irish Water Spaniel, read on.

Nicknamed the clever clown dog, the Irish Water Spaniel is fun-loving and mischievous.


Many people debate the true origin of the Irish Water Spaniel however; there is no doubt that its perfection occurred in Ireland. In the 1830s, Justin McCarthy owned a kennel which is considered to be the start of this wonderful breed. His dog that was called Boatswain is believed to be the father of what we all would consider the modern day Irish Water Spaniel. Even in the early 1800s, these great dogs were prized for their hunting skills and agility as well as their good nature living within a family.

Because Justin McCarthy died without revealing exactly how he created the Irish Water Spaniel, the true combination of breeds will never be known. People have speculated that the French Poodle called the Barbet could have been bred with a Portuguese Water Dog to create this incredible breed. It must also be taken into consideration that there were two styles of water spaniels known to be in Ireland at that time. The whole point is moot because McCarthy never revealed his secret and when he passed away, he took all of the information about the creation of the breed with him.


It is essential that all owners of Irish Water Spaniels understand that these are high energy dogs. Therefore, they need to be fed a high-quality diet specifically manufactured for active and athletic dogs. Dry kibble is recommended to prevent early tooth decay and gum disease. Feeding a diet of dry food also cuts down on doggie breath caused by plaque built up on the teeth.

You’ll find that the Irish Water Spaniel is a trainable breed of dog.


You’ll find that the Irish Water Spaniel is a trainable breed of dog. He has an insatiable desire to please his people; this makes him a likely candidate for many show events including hunting trials and obedience trials. It also makes him a wonderful companion for an active family.

It is important that obedience training be started at an early age. This breed can become mischievous so regular training sessions can be beneficial. One of the best things about this breed is that the Irish Water Spaniels are not barkers. They will only bark to alert their family that strangers or intruders are about. Few are mouthy so long as they are provided with adequate toys during the teething stages.


Male Irish Water Spaniels should weigh between 55 and 65 pounds and females should weigh between 45 and 60 pounds.

Because the Irish Water Spaniel has a unique outlook on life, he tends to be extremely watchful and cautious around strangers. This doesn’t always equate to a problem with timidity. A well-socialized puppy that has been exposed to a variety of people, situations, noises and events will still be a bit cautious when a new person or thing shows up in the home or his surroundings. It is in his nature to evaluate the situation and eventually approach the newcomer or new situation. Again, this is not being timid; this is being watchful and is a sought after trait within the breed.


A generally healthy breed, the Irish Water Spaniel is still predisposed to health issues. Hip dysplasia is one that breeders have been trying to eliminate for years but it can also be triggered by a dog’s environment. Playing, falling or jumping on slippery tile floors can increase the puppy’s risk of being diagnosed with hip dysplasia, as can excessive weight gain in a short period of time, obesity and over exertion.

Cataracts can affect any older canine however; Juvenile Cataracts have been diagnosed within the breed. Dogs between the ages of 2 and 4 years of age might exhibit signs of hair loss. This may be attributed to Follicular Dysplasia. It does not create any true health issues provided the owner covers the hairless areas with sunscreen. Unfortunately, the coat loss is permanent.

Irish Water Spaniels are also predisposed to Hypothyroidism, a treatable hormonal disorder. Entropion, Paronychia, Distichiasis and Epilepsy can also be found within the breed. Megaesophagus is a problem occasionally presented by owners of Irish Water Spaniels. Unfortunately, there is no cure and the morbidity rate is quite high. This breed can be highly sensitive to vaccines and other medications. Great care should be given when pups are being vaccinated or treated for illness.


With proper housing, exercise and veterinary care, an Irish Water Spaniel should live between 10 and 12 years.


Irish Water Spaniels are bundles of energy and quite athletic by genetics. They thrive when they are able to run, play, chase down game and retrieve fowl. They are not at all happy leading sedentary lives and can become destructive without regular activities that will enthrall and exert them. They require at least an hour of playtime daily in order to keep them in tiptop shape. Of course, they love water so if you sit in your yard and have a hard plastic wading pool, they will happily retrieve dummies for hours. This is what makes Irish Water Spaniels awesome companions for families with sturdy kids.

Because the Irish Water Spaniel has a unique outlook on life, he tends to be extremely watchful and cautious around strangers.


According to the AKC, the Irish Water Spaniel is: “Suitable for allergy sufferers, their hypoallergenic coats require brushing every few weeks and trimming every two months to neaten and shape the coat.” This versatile breed was recognized by the AKC in 1884.


A double coated breed, the Irish Water Spaniel has tight ringlets of curls that cover his back, sides and rear end. Longer curls cover the legs and undercarriage of the dog. The face, front portion of the neck, toes and tail is covered in short hair. Every Irish Water Spaniel is liver in color and without any white markings, other than graying due to advanced age.

Because Irish Water Spaniels shed little coat, it is absolutely essential that the owner brush the dog thoroughly at least three times a week. This will help to distribute the waterproofing oils through the coat as well as eliminate any tangles which could eventually cause matting.


Irish Water Spaniel puppies are as cute as can be but without proper attention, training and exercise, they can become nightmares. They must be socialized and they crave attention from their human families. These great dogs require time, exercise and lots of love from their owners.

There has been a recent surge in dog lovers and prospective dog parents interested in hypoallergenic pups. The allure of a hypoallergenic dog is undeniable for those who may feel limited due to allergies. But does the perfect allergy-free pet truly exist?While there is no such thing as a completely hypoallergenic dog, certain breeds are less likely to trigger allergic reactions. This could open the door for pet allergy sufferers to add a furry companion to the family. This guide will explore the reality of hypoallergenic dogs and help you choose the dog that best suits the needs and sensitivities of your family.What is a “Hypoallergenic Dog?”Let’s start with the basics: what exactly is a hypoallergenic dog? Contrary to popular belief, the term hypoallergenic, when applied to a product or item, does not mean that it absolutely cannot cause an allergic reaction. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “hypoallergenic” is defined as “having little likelihood of causing an allergic response.”These are dog breeds that are less likely to cause problems for allergy sufferers due to various physical characteristics. For example, the breed may be low shedding, have shorter coats (or be considered hairless), or the coat type naturally catches and traps allergens like loose hair and dander, controlling its spread around your home.While these qualities make it more likely that these dogs could co-exist peacefully with an allergic family member, it is important to note that they are not 100% free from allergens.Which Dogs are Considered to be HypoallergenicDeciding which dogs are considered to be hypoallergenic is a bit of a grey area. Some breeds will make the list when speaking with one expert, and not the list shared by the next. This can make it difficult to determine if a dog you are considering will be a good fit for your home.Even if the dog breed you are considering is well-known for their hypoallergenic coats, I recommend having a conversation with the breeder, the shelter/rescue you are adopting from, and your doctor (or allergist) to prepare yourself to take precautions and minimize any risk. Individual dogs may have unique grooming needs or considerations even within a breed.Here is a list of breeds commonly referred to as hypoallergenic: Affenpinscher Afghan Hound American Hairless TerrierBarbado da Terceira Barbet Bedlington Terrier Bichon Frise Bolognese Chinese Crested Coton de Tulear Irish Water Spaniel Kerry Blue Terrier Lagotto Romagnolo Lowchen Maltese Peruvian Inca Orchid Poodle (Toy, Miniature, Standard) Portuguese Water DogRussian Tsvetnaya BolonkaSchnauzer ( Miniature, Standard, Giant) Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Xoloitzcuintli Yorkshire TerrierWhat about mixed-breed dogs? With the current buzz surrounding poodle mixes like Golden Doodles, Bernedoodles, Labradoodles, and more, many interested in finding a hypoallergenic companion have been told they are the perfect option. The truth is that no one can give you an honest and definite answer that can be applied to all dogs of a specific mix.While “doodle” dogs do have poodles in their genes, it can’t be guaranteed that the hypoallergenic qualities of a poodle coat will be present in every puppy. For example, a Golden Doodle (Golden Retriever/Poodle) could be born with a hypoallergenic poodle-like coat or a coat that resembles the Golden Retriever more. If you live with allergies, you know that Golden Retrievers are definitely not a hypoallergenic option.This isn’t to say that mixed breeds won’t be hypoallergenic. However, you need to consider each dog&#39;s physical attributes individually instead of making an assumption based on their breed makeup. Dog Breeds Commonly Mislabeled as HypoallergenicOf course, while people generally mean well when making recommendations of the best dog for people with allergies, mistakes are going to be made. Some dog breeds are often recommended that shouldn’t be given this label.As we just discussed, the first group of dogs that should be mentioned here are mixed-breed dogs. While mixed breeds can be born with the hypoallergenic characteristics of a parent, there is no guarantee that the puppies will inherit those physical traits. Many families have adopted poodle mixes with the promise of purchasing a hypoallergenic dog, only to find their new beloved family member is badly triggering allergies in the home.Dog breeds often mistaken for hypoallergenic may share traits or commonalities with dogs on the previous list. However, they have other characteristics that contribute to allergic reactions in those around them. For example, a dog could have a very short coat but produce larger amounts of dander, a common dog-related allergen.Purebreds that are often mistaken or mislabeled as hypoallergenic include: Basset Hound Boxer Doberman Pinscher  Labrador Retriever  Pug Shih TzuIf in doubt, speak with the breeder or rescue worker about your needs. A reputable breeder will be knowledgeable about the breed they produce and committed to only placing their dogs in homes that are an ideal fit. Shelter and rescue workers are dedicated to finding the best home for the dogs in their care. Even if the dog you’re considering adopting isn’t a good fit, they will likely have recommendations for others you should consider.
Spaniel breeds are a group of hunting and retrieving dogs, or more precisely, gun dogs. This means that they were originally bred for assisting hunters in tracking down and capturing all types of game, but mostly birds, whether on land or on water. Of course, as time passed, the breeds evolved, and now many of the Spaniel breeds are now loved as family pets for their intelligence, friendly disposition, and love for adventure. In addition to the classic spaniel breeds that fit in the gun dog or bird dog category, there are also “faux” spaniel breeds – dogs that have the name Spaniel in their name but weren’t bred for hunting and retrieving – as well as designer dogs which are spaniel mixes. To learn more about all of these magnificent dogs, dive with us into the diverse world of spaniel breeds and meet some of the most popular spaniels around!&nbsp;
American Water Spaniel Basics
You may know the American Water Spaniel as the &ldquo;little brown dog.&rdquo; This curly-coated breed is the classic &ldquo;big dog in a small package.&rdquo; Although this dog looks small and cute, don&rsquo;t be fooled &ndash; the American Water Spaniel (nicknamed AWS) is a tough hunting dog that&rsquo;s known for having a stubborn streak. A water retriever, this dog can be a hunter&rsquo;s best friend&hellip; as well as a life-long companion for your family.
The American Water Spaniel is also famous for its love of barking, which makes it a wonderful watchdog. It&rsquo;s just one of the qualities that make them a great family pet. Add a loving nature and a willingness to please, and you&rsquo;ve got a dog that will offer many years of joy and happiness. Energetic and sensitive, the American Water Spaniel is a good fit for numerous lifestyles. One of the rarer breeds, it may take some work to find one. Read on to find out if this breed is a fit for you.
Energetic and sensitive, the American Water Spaniel is a good fit for numerous lifestyles.
Origin
No one is exactly sure of the origin of the American Water Spaniel, but the breed did make its first appearance in the 1860s. These dogs followed settlers that moved to the developing areas of the Midwestern United States. A hunting and retrieving dog, the American Water Spaniel was bred to flush and retrieve game in all conditions and terrain, including water. Although it was seen primarily as a duck and waterfowl retriever, it evolved into a combo of hunting spaniels and the hunting retrievers. Working equally well in water and on land, the AWS is a great swimmer and can sniff out its prey. Thanks to its small size, the American Water Spaniel fits nicely in canoes or other small boats needed to hunt waterfowl on inland lakes.
By the end of the 19th century, the American Water Spaniel had made a name for itself, gaining popularity with sportsmen in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.

You&rsquo;re standing at the edge of a lake and decide to throw a stick into the water for your pooch to fetch. Which breeds are splashing down before the target hits the water and which are sneaking back to the car with their tail between their legs?
Some dog breeds just can&rsquo;t get enough of the wet stuff while others are born landlubbers who prefer nothing more than the dry warmth of terra firma. These water breeds below love the water.
Why do dogs like the water?
Many dogs love to swim. Seriously, think of the term &lsquo;Doggie Paddle&rsquo; and wonder where that came from for a minute. The majority of dogs who love to swim do so for a couple of different reasons.
One is that a dog&rsquo;s body is often built to swim. The way their body weight is distributed along with their (sometimes) webbed paws and natural instincts makes them great swimmers. Their tails act like a great rudder to steer them along and their water-resistant coats mean that they stay warm and dry quickly no matter the water they go in. Additionally, dogs with longer legs love swimming because &ndash;well, they have the legs that are built for it. Long, lean kicks and movements in the water help keep them afloat and when you combine that with their desire to do smart things for their owners (like hunt and point)? Many dogs just love the water because it allows them to please their owners.
Additionally, introducing dogs early on can make them love the water. You shouldn&rsquo;t ever make your fearful dog get into water if they don&rsquo;t want to, but take the time to train them and even use life jackets if need be if you&rsquo;re not 100% sure they&rsquo;re good. Even though they may be a water breed, they still have normal tendencies that play into their behaviors; be cognizant of that.

Bigger dogs, less discipline, or maybe we're just too busy on our cell phones...
Every cat breed has its own set of distinguishing features, but there are some breeds that are especially eye-catching because of their standout characteristics. Here’s a short list of some unique cat breeds that are sure to grab your attention and your heart.
(photo credit: Gudman / shutterstock.com)I was raised to believe you shouldn’t bathe a dog because it would deplete the natural oils in their fur and dry out their skin. Back in the day, it was assumed that a dog’s ability to self-groom was sufficient to take care of whatever clean-up they might need.Fast forward, and with dogs sleeping in our beds and snuggling on our sofas, we’re suddenly much more aware of the need to keep our pets well-groomed and yes, smelling fresher.Aesthetics aside, bathing your dog not only allows you to check for ticks, sores, and lumps that shouldn’t be there, but a periodic scrub can also keep his skin and hair, healthy. With some breeds such as Yorkshire Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Dachshunds, and West Highland Terriers (to name a few), a skin condition called Seborrhea can be common. Yes, just like with humans it’s down to an increased production of skin cells and/or skin oils.When it’s the dry version, you get flaky, scaly skin cells (dandruff) caused by excess keratin production. When oily, you get a waxy substance comes from the sebaceous glands which causes your dog’s coat to look greasy.Whether your pooch falls into the above category or he simply loves to dig, burrow, and roll in whatever he can when given the chance, cleaning him up is something you both deserve.
While kittens are undeniably adorable, thousands of adult cats are waiting for their forever home in animal shelters and rescue organizations across the country. Adopting an adult cat offers many unique benefits and rewards – from their calmer demeanor to their already-established personalities.Before deciding on your next feline friend, I recommend taking a moment to reconsider whether an adult cat could be the right fit for your home and lifestyle. Here are a few key considerations to help you find the right cat for your family. At What Age is a Cat Considered Adult? Before discussing the benefits of adopting an adult cat, let's start at the beginning. At what age is a cat considered an adult, anyway? Like with dogs, this will depend on your cat’s breed and size. Larger breed cats like Maine Coons and Norwegian Forest Cats will take longer to reach maturity than most others. For most cat breeds, you can start referring to them as an adult around the time of their first birthday. For those larger kitties, it can take up to 2 years. If your cat is on the borderline or you’re unsure, consider asking your veterinarian during your next appointment. Understanding your cat’s life stages and growth rate will help you make many important decisions, like ensuring their diet includes everything they need in each chapter of their lives. Do Older Cats Have a Harder Time Getting Adopted? Many factors can make it more challenging for a cat to be adopted, including their color, personality, comfort with other pets, and, unfortunately, their age. When a young kitten comes into a shelter or rescue organization, they are often adopted within the first couple of months. The same can’t be said for most adult cats. There is no exact figure, but experts in the rescue space estimate that the time needed for an adult cat (aged 2-3) to be adopted is double that of their younger counterparts. That timeline continues to climb, reaching nearly 10 times as long for cats aged 9-10. 7 Reasons to Adopt an Adult Cat When considering adding a new companion to the family, whether it’s a hamster or a new puppy, you should start by doing your research. This includes assessing whether the animal of choice is a good fit for your family and lifestyle and deciding on other key factors like the right age and breed. Here are 7 reasons you may want to consider an adult cat instead of a kitten: They Are Generally Calmer There is no denying that kittens are adorable, but they are also bouncy and full of kitten energy. These active little furballs are adorable at first. However, in time, they can begin to feel like “too much” for some cat lovers. An adult cat could be a better option if you want a slightly calmer, more mature companion. That being said, there is an exception to every rule. Most adult cats are calmer and more relaxed, but many high-energy adult cats are also out there. If this is an important consideration when searching for your “right fit,” be sure to ask the shelter or rescue volunteers about the energy levels and personality of any cat you are considering. They will either have first-hand experience with the cat or will be able to connect you with someone who can answer your questions (like a foster parent). Less Supervision is Required If you have ever had to kitten-proof your home, you know how much trouble that cute little kitty can get into. They can get into everything and anything, including chewing electrical cords, scratching your furniture, and eating anything they can get their furry little paws on. Bringing a kitten home means doing a lot more preparation upfront as well as committing to the ongoing supervision they will require. Cat lovers who have a busier lifestyle or a demanding work schedule may not be able to give a kitten the time and attention they need to keep them safe and happy. Unless you work in a pet-friendly work environment where you can bring your kitten along for the day (and have done the work to kitten-proof that space, too) or have someone at home when you’re not, your lifestyle may be better suited to an older cat who can relax at home comfortably throughout the work day. Most Are Already Housetrained We often talk about the importance of potty training for puppies, but what about kittens? Not every cat is going to take to a litter box right away. Typically speaking, kittens are taught to use the litter box by their mothers early in life. However, your new kitten may not have learned this important life lesson for several reasons. It’s possible that they left their mother too early or they needed a little extra teaching to learn the basics. If a kitten hasn’t naturally learned to use the litterbox, you’ll need to train them to do their business in the right place. However, by the time they reach adulthood, someone has likely acknowledged they didn’t learn this skill from their mother and addressed it already. Their Personality is Known Anyone who says cats don’t have personalities has never shared their heart and home with a cat! I firmly believe that. We have two cats, Pippen and Jinx, with very different personalities and temperaments. While Pippen is sweet and loving, Jinx is a stereotypical tortoiseshell – sassy and spirited. You may not be feeling picky about the personality of your newest family member. However, some cat lovers are looking for a specific personality to match their lifestyle and vision of life with the new kitty. For example, if you hope to spend time snuggled up watching TV with your feline friend, an independent cat who isn’t interested in cuddles won’t be the ideal match. When kittens are young, they still haven’t “found themselves” yet. This means you are taking a gamble on their personality. Adult cats, however, are established in their personalities. What you see is what you get.

As someone who lives with six cats, pet hair is a daily reality. Skipping even a day of vacuuming means finding tufts in every corner, and lint-rolling myself is practically a ritual before I leave the house. That’s why I was eager – but skeptical – to try the PawSwing: an automatic self-groomer that promises to handle pet hair without fuss.

PawSwing is an automatic self groomer for cats which provides a 360° combing experience – no electricity required. It is equipped with innovative bionic tongue brushes (which are essentially brushes with short soft bristles that mimic the hook shape of cat’s tongue surface) that are situated on the grooming disc, aka the entrance to a felt box. The disc can be adjusted to suit different body types, so both petite kitties and chonky cuties can get the best grooming experience.
A delightful crossbreed of charming  Labrador Retrievers and elegant  Poodles, Labradoodles combine the best traits of both breeds: intelligence, a friendly nature, hypoallergenic coats, and a boundless love for fun.

Are you thinking of adding a small animal to the family? Congratulations! Rodents and other small, furry friends are often overlooked in a pet industry that focuses on cats and dogs – but they can be amazing companions!Now that you’ve decided to welcome a new pet into the home, it’s time to determine what pet is the right fit for your household. For some, this is easy. If you have fallen in love with a specific pet, you likely already have your mind made up. If you haven’t decided, we’re here to help.Two pets that are often lumped together (mistakenly) are rats and mice. While both are intelligent, social, and surprisingly clean animals, there are some significant differences.Keep reading to learn more about owning a rat or a mouse as a pet, including a comparison of key factors like lifespan, personality, and care requirements. By the end, you’ll have the information needed to confidently choose the perfect pet for your family.Is a Rodent Right for You?Before digging into the details of these two adorable options, the first question you need to consider is whether any rodent is the right pet for you. While dogs and cats are the most popular pets, rodents have been gaining popularity.These pocket-sized pets are generally more affordable to care for and require smaller living spaces, although this could vary depending on which rodent you choose. Many rodents are surprisingly social, allowing you to enjoy that human/animal bond while still making it easy to keep “their space” to a contained area in your home. If you are worried about the struggle of pet fur or muddy paw prints everywhere, that may be a huge win!However, not all aspects of rodent care are considered benefits. For those with young children, handling a rodent may lead to trouble, including injuries to the rodent from being mishandled or to your child if the rodent feels unsafe, causing them to bite.Finding a veterinarian who specializes in exotic animals and can provide your new rodent with the care they require can be challenging. I recommend contacting local veterinarians and veterinary hospitals to make sure that you have someone available in your community who can provide the care your pet may need.Small animals have a shorter lifespan, allowing you to experience the joy of sharing your life with a pet without a long-term commitment. Unfortunately, that does mean dealing with the grief of losing a pet much sooner.Ultimately, the decision of whether a rodent is the right pet for you and your family will depend on your lifestyle, individual circumstances, and personal preferences. If, after reading all this, you still believe that a rodent is the perfect choice, it’s time to consider your options… Rats vs Mice: A Closer Look There are many different rodents to consider when searching for your ideal pet, but two often-confused pets are rats and mice. While these furry friends do have a lot in common, there are also many differences that set them apart. Here are a few essential factors to consider when deciding on the best choice for your household:Average LifespanAs already mentioned, rodents, in general, do have shorter lifespans than the average dog or cat. However, there is also a difference between rats and mice. Most domesticated rats live approximately 2-4 years, but some live considerably longer than twice that. According to the Guinness World Records, the oldest rat (named Rodney) lived to be seven years and four months old. Domesticated mice have a slightly shorter lifespan of approximately 1-3 years. This, too, can vary considerably. Guinness World Records lists the record holder of the world’s oldest mouse as a San Diego mouse named Patrick Stewart, who lived 9 years and 180 days. But this shouldn’t be considered normal, as Patrick Steward lived over 2 years longer than the former world record holder, Fritzy.Ideal HabitatBoth rats and mice can live a long, happy life with a cage as their primary habitat, assuming the cage provides enough space. Many of the cages you will find on pet store shelves are not actually adequate for a rodent’s needs. This includes not only cages for rats and mice but also cages available for rabbits, guinea pigs, and even hamsters. It’s a common problem in the pet industry across all small animals.The exact measurements of the ideal habitat for a mouse or rat will vary slightly from expert to expert. However, a general rule of thumb is that the minimum cage size for a mouse is 18 inches long x 12 inches wide x 12 inches high. For each additional mouse, add ½ square foot to the total floor area. You must also pay close attention to the width of the cage bars, as mice are skilled at slipping through even the smallest spaces.The space required to keep a rat is larger, which may need to be factored into your decision. The recommended minimum cage size for a single rat is 20 inches long x 14 inches wide x 24 inches high. You should add one square food to the floor area for each additional rat.Both species need plenty of tunnels, tubes, branches, and hideaways. They are prey animals, always needing to be alert and stay safe in the wild. While it’s true that no one is hunting your new pet in their cage, you still need to provide them with several hiding spaces to feel safe and secure. These structures also offer much-needed mental enrichment.Rats and mice also need items they can chew on, like mineral blocks or wooden structures, to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown.Many of the cheaper and more commonly used wood shavings for bedding are unsafe for your rodent. Improperly dried pine shavings and cedar expose them to toxic dust and odors that can lead to severe or life-threatening upper respiratory infections. They have very sensitive respiratory systems, making them highly susceptible to issues. Both rats and mice will thrive with an absorbent, chemical-free soft paper bedding like Kaytee Clean & Cozy White Paper Bedding. You can also mix in some aspen shavings to make tunneling easier. The bedding should be at least 6 inches thick across the bottom of their habitat.

Originating in Ireland, the Irish Water Spaniel features a dense, curly, water-resistant coat that sets it apart from other spaniels. With a sharp and playful personality, Irish Water Spaniels are highly intelligent and excel in various tasks, including hunting waterfowl and retrieving objects from the water. These active dogs are known for their natural swimming abilities and webbed feet, making them well-suited for water-related activities. They are loyal and affectionate companions, often forming strong bonds with their families, and their active and lively nature makes them well-suited for families and individuals who enjoy outdoor adventures and activities.
Though highly intelligent and easy to train, Irish Water Spaniels also have a stubborn side that can challenge novice dog parents. Make sure you can provide firm, consistent training before deciding if this breed is right for you.
When considering this dog breed, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you decide to purchase an Irish Water Spaniel puppy, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Irish Water Spaniel breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The Irish Water Spaniel is often mistaken for a large brown poodle because of his distinctive top knot and the curly hair that covers his body. While back in the deeps of time a Poodle ancestor may be lurking in his family tree, the Irish Water Spaniel is most definitely not a Poodle. Rather, he might be described as what the standard Poodle once was: a versatile hunting, pointing, and retrieving dog.
Not surprisingly, given his name, the Irish Water Spaniel is known for his strong swimming skills and excels at retrieving waterfowl as well as upland game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. Not content with his striking looks and hunting talents, he’s an entertainer as well.
The IWS is known for his clownish behavior. He often makes a game out of a simple task and always seems to be having a wonderful time. Irish Water Spaniels are highly intelligent, active, willing and energetic. The centuries of breeding that have contributed to their retrieving skills have also instilled in them a desire to please. This makes an Irish Water Spaniel relatively easy to train.
That said, he has a mischievous streak that can cause him to be a challenge at times to deal with. The breed can do well in obedience work, but that mischievous, fun-loving personality may surface unexpectedly during competition and wreak havoc with your goals for that day.
The Irish Water Spaniel is a relatively quiet dog for the most part. He seems to reserve his barking for times when it’s necessary to warn his family. His alert and inquisitive temperament makes him an excellent watchdog. While he’s usually devoted to the entire family, he may choose a particular person as his favorite.
The Irish Water Spaniel’s dense coat does require some commitment to grooming on a regular basis. It must be brushed two to three times a week to prevent mats from forming. The natural oils in his water-repellent coat attract dirt and debris and hold it in the coat. Brushing helps to distribute the oil through the coat and removes any debris.
An interesting characteristic is their webbed feet, which come in handy when they’re swimming. Irish Water Spaniels love to swim and will plunge into any nearby body of water if given half a chance. And they may not be ready to leave the water when you’re ready for them to. If you can provide this breed with opportunities to swim, do so! It’s great exercise for this high-energy dog.
The Irish Water Spaniel can be the perfect companion for an active family with the time to socialize, train, and exercise him. He’ll be a devoted, loving member of the family and will entertain all with his clownish and mischievous attitude toward life. Your Irish Water Spaniel can be a hunting companion, conformation, obedience, agility, or rally competitor or just a friend and loving companion for everyone in the family.
The exact origin of this breed as many others is debated among fanciers and shrouded in the mists of Ireland. The Irish Water Spaniel appeared in Ireland in the 1830s, mainly from the kennel of Justin McCarthy. His dog “Boatswain,” whelped in 1834, is credited with being the sire of the modern breed. Mr. McCarthy would never reveal the sources of his breeding and took the secret with him when he died.
Speculation focuses on the early Barbet or Poodle-type dogs from France that could have come to Ireland and possibly Portuguese Water Dogs that arrived on Portuguese fishing boats. There were also two types of water spaniels in Ireland at the time, one of which sported a curly coat and could have contributed to the breed’s makeup.
The first show classes for the breed were at a show in Birmingham in 1862, and in 1899 the first Irish Water Spaniel ran in a field trial. There were four Irish Water Spaniels entered in the first Westminster Kennel Club show in 1877. The Irish Water Spaniel remains an active, popular working and show dog in his native country. The breed came to the United States in the 1870s but has never had the popularity that he enjoys in Ireland. Today, the Irish Water Spaniel ranks 139th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club, a well-kept secret indeed.
The IWS is the tallest member of the spaniel family. Males are 22 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 65 pounds; females are 21 to 23 inches tall and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
True to his spaniel nature, the IWS is alert and inquisitive. Unlike many spaniels, however, he may be reserved toward strangers, although he should never be shy or aggressive. Irish Water Spaniels are highly trainable, but they’re independent thinkers and will do their best to get their own way whenever possible. This is especially true with young males testing their status. For this reason, they are probably not the best choice for a first-time dog owner who may not understand how to provide the guidance and sensible discipline this dog needs.
Like every dog, Irish Water Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they’re young. Socialization helps ensure that your IWS puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Water Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Water Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.
A hunting breed with a great deal of energy and stamina, the Irish Water Spaniel needs a yard to romp in and isn’t suited to apartment life. Give him at least an hour a day of running, long walks or hikes, or vigorous play such as retrieving a ball in the yard. If you have a pool or access to a lake, swimming is a great way for him to get exercise. Keep an eye on him just as you would a child, and be sure he knows how to get out of the pool safely. You can break up his activity into two or three 20- or 30-minute sessions throughout the day. As with any dog, don’t run him ragged in the heat of the day.
Irish Water Spaniel puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile.
After he’s a year old, your IWS pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Irish Water Spaniels work well with people, but they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kind but firm consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The IWS who’s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. An Irish Water Spaniel will make his own entertainment if you don’t.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. If you’re unsure whether your Irish Water Spaniel is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can’t, he needs less food and more exercise.
NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don’t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you’ll need to shake into your dog’s bowl. For more on feeding your Irish Water Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Irish Water Spaniel has a double coat — a top coat and an under coat — with tight, crisp ringlets that cover the back, back, sides, and rear. Beneath the ribs the hair is longer, and curls and waves of hair cover the legs. Hair on the throat is short and smooth, forming a v-shaped patch. The curly body forms a sharp contrast with the smooth coat on the face, throat, toes, and tail.
Speaking of the tail, it’s a striking characteristic of the breed. Wide at the root, where the tail meets the body, it tapers to a fine point. It’s covered with short, smooth hair and is known as a rat tail. The Irish Water Spaniel is always a solid liver color, described as deep reddish brown. You won’t see any white markings on him except for those due to graying from age.
Irish Water Spaniels shed little to no hair, but they must be brushed two or three times a week to keep the coat from tangling or matting, as well as to keep it clean and healthy. The oil in the coat attracts debris and dirt. Regular brushing not only distributes the oil throughout the coat to keep the skin healthy but also removes the dirt and debris.
The breed can be prone to ear infections due to the pendant earflap. In other words, those floppy ears hold in moisture, and the wet, warm environment is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Clean and dry the ears every time your IWS goes swimming. To do this, gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your IWS may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.
Brush your Irish Water Spaniel’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.
Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn’t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they’re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog’s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your IWS enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your IWS to being brushed and examined when he’s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.
Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you’ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he’s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Water Spaniels do best with children if they are raised with them. Early socialization — exposure to a variety of peoples, places, sights, sounds, and situations — also helps. Always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he’s eating or to try to take the dog’s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Irish Water Spaniels can get along well with other pets in the family if introduced to them at a young age. Otherwise, supervise them carefully. They are hunting dogs and may view smaller animals, especially birds, as prey. Protect pet birds even if you’re sure your IWS understands they’re off limits. Some spaniels can learn that, if they’re taught from puppyhood, but don’t assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your IWS doesn’t pull your parakeet’s tail or your parrot won’t take a bite out of your Irish Water Spaniel’s sensitive nose.
Irish Water Spaniels are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Irish Water Spaniels in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don’t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Irish Water Spaniel rescue.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems, and they may not socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have both health and behavioral issues.

The Irish Water Spaniel is an ancient breed and one of the tallest spaniels around. They were originally bred to retrieve water fowl and other game in more challenging marshland terrains. They boast a lovely dark liver coat that's made up of tight ringlets which cover the entire body except muzzles the front of a dog's neck and most of a dog’s tail which adds to their endearing appearance.
These charming dogs not only boast quite a unique coat but they are also known to have very kind and affectionate natures with the added bonus being they have a real sense of humour which makes them great fun to have around. The Irish Water Spaniel is an adaptable character being just at home in the field as they are in a family environment which is why the breed is finding fanbase in the UK as companions and family pets.
The actual origins and ancestry of the Irish Water Spaniel remain a bit of a mystery although there are records of "Water Dogs" in Persia that date as far back as 4000 BC. With this said the very first reference to dogs of a similar type in Ireland was in the mid 1800’s. However there are those who believe the breed came about when foreign fishermen bought their dogs with them to Ireland which included fishermen from France Italy Spain and Portugal. What is known is that all the Irish Water Spaniels we see today can trace their ancestry back to one dog named Boatswain a IWS owned by Justin McCarthy during the 1800's.
The breed became popular when they were exhibited for the first time in Birmingham in 1862. With this said Irish Water Spaniels were always highly prized in their native Ireland thanks to their kind natures and their natural instincts which in short meant they were extremely versatile in a hunting environment.
Here in the UK the Irish Water Spaniel is classed as a "spaniel" in the showring whereas when these dogs compete in any field trials they are classed as "retrievers". Today the Irish Water Spaniel has become a popular choice as both a companion dog and as a family pet with people who lead active outdoor lives and who are able to dedicate the time these dogs need to be truly happy well-rounded characters. Because they are so intelligent Irish Water Spaniels are also often used as therapy and PAT dogs but they are also used as detector dogs seeking out explosives and drugs.
Height at the withers: Males 53 - 58 cm Females 51 - 56 cm
Average weight: Males 25 - 30 kg Females 20 - 26 kg
The Irish Water Spaniel has a strong jaw with a perfect scissor bite where their upper teeth neatly overlap their lower ones. Their necks are strong and powerful with dogs holding them arched which adds to their noble appearance. Their shoulders slope but are powerful with dogs having reasonably deep wide chests and nice straight well boned front legs.
Their bodies are nicely proportioned with ribs being well laid back and well sprung. Backs are broad short and level with dogs boasting deep wide loins. Their hindquarters are also powerful with dogs having strong back legs and nice round large feet that are well covered in hair which includes in between the toes. An Irish Water Spaniel's tail is quite short and thicker at the root but it tapers to a fine point at the tip. It's set low and the base is covered in tight curls which stop abruptly. Dogs carry their tails straight out and never over their backs.
It is worth noting that the accepted breed colours for Kennel Club registration may differ from the colours set out in the breed standard.
When an Irish Water Spaniel moves they do so with a free gait showing a good reach and drive from behind. They have a rolling action that is typical of the breed thanks to their barrel-shaped rib cages.
The Kennel Club frowns on any exaggerations or departures from the breed standard and would judge the faults on how much they affect a dog's overall health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform.
Males should have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums and it is worth noting that a dog can be a little lighter or heavier as well as slightly taller or shorter than set out in the Kennel Club breed standard which is only given as a guideline.
Irish Water Spaniels are known to be "people" dogs loving nothing more than to please their owners whether they are working in the field or in a home environment. They form strong bonds with their families and don’t like being left on their own for even shorter periods of time. If they are left to their own devices these charming and attractive dogs can suffer from separation anxiety. They thrive on human contact and are therefore a great choice for people who lead active outdoor lives and like to have a canine companion at their side. They do well when they live in a household where one person usually stays at home when everyone else is out.
They are can be a little wary of people they do not know but an Irish Water Spaniel would rarely show any sort of aggressive behaviour towards a stranger preferring to just keep out of their way. They are courageous bold characters by nature and love nothing more than to be kept busy which means they are high-energy dogs that need a ton of mental stimulation and daily exercise to be truly happy well-rounded characters. The Irish Water Spaniel has a lot of stamina with the added bonus of them having a real sense of humour which means they are always ready to entertain and be entertained.
With this said an IWS is not the best choice for a first-time owner because they need to be trained and gently handled by someone who is familiar with the breed or they might start to show a more dominant side to their nature which can turn an Irish Water Spaniel into a more wilful character that's harder to manage.
As previously mentioned an Irish Water Spaniel is not the best choice for first time dog owners because they need to be well socialised handled correctly and trained from a young age by people who are familiar with the specific needs of this type of intelligent energetic dog. An IWS would quickly get the better of a novice owner which can make them harder to handle and live with.
Although Irish Water Spaniels are very social by nature they have working and hunting in their lineage and as such they have a very high prey drive. A IWS would happily chase anything that moves or tries to run away which means care must always be taken as to where and when a dog can run off the lead more especially if there is livestock and/or wildlife close by.
In the home environment an Irish Water Spaniel is known to be a playful and fun-loving character that loves to be involved in anything that goes on around them which involves playing games. However playtime can get a bit boisterous which means care should be taken when smaller children are around. They excel at all sorts of canine sports which includes agility and flyball to name but two of the activities they enjoy. Irish Water Spaniels are renowned for their resourcefulness when it comes to finding ways of amusing themselves and anyone else that’s around.
Irish Water Spaniels are highly adaptable dogs and providing they are given enough daily physical exercise combined with as much mental stimulation to prevent boredom from setting in they are just as happy in a home environment as they are working in the field. However they are not suited to living in an apartment because they benefit from being able to roam around in a secure back garden whenever possible so they can really let off steam.
Irish Water Spaniels form strong ties with their families and dogs are never very happy when they find themselves left on their own for longer periods of time. They are better suited to people who either work from home or in households where one person stays at home when everyone else is out so they are never alone for any length of time which could see a dog suffering from separation anxiety. This can lead to them being destructive around the home which is a dog's way of relieving any stress they are feeling and a way to keep themselves entertained which could include barking incessantly to get someone’s attention.
Irish Water Spaniels are not known to be “barkers” with most dogs only voicing an opinion when they think it is necessary to alert an owner to something they don’t like is going on in their environment.
As their name suggests Irish Water Spaniels love swimming and will take to the water whatever the weather and as such care should always be taken when walking dogs off the lead anywhere near more dangerous watercourses just in case a dog decides to leap in and then needs rescuing because they cannot get out of the water on their own.
Although Irish Water Spaniels are friendly and social by nature they are good watchdogs and always quick off the mark when it comes to alerting an owner to when strangers are about although they would rarely do this aggressively preferring to keep their distance and bark.
The Irish Water Spaniel is known to be highly intelligent they are not only quick on their feet but they learn new things extremely fast too. As such their training must start early and it must be consistent and always fair for these dogs to mature into well-behaved and obedient characters. It cannot be stressed enough the importance of early socialisation for an IWS. As soon as a dog has been fully vaccinated they need to be introduced to as many new situations people animals and other dogs as possible for them to grow up to be well-rounded adult dogs.
An Irish Water Spaniel is slow to mature which must be taken into account when they are being trained. It's best to take things slowly always showing an IWS a lot of patience and understanding to get the best results. They are sensitive dogs by nature and do not respond well to any sort of harsh correction or heavy-handed training but they do answer well to gentle positive reinforcement. Their training also must be as diverse as possible to keep an IWS focused because if things get too repetitive these intelligent dogs soon lose interest in a training session.
Irish Water Spaniel puppies like all puppies are incredibly cute which means it is all too easy to spoil them when they first arrive in their new homes. Puppies quickly grow up to be larger adult dogs which means as soon as a puppy is settled they must be taught the rules and boundaries as well as what is acceptable behaviours and what is not. This also helps establish a “pecking order” which is essential when dealing with an intelligent and often more dominant breed. The first commands a puppy must be taught are as follows:
The Irish Water Spaniel boasts a loving and affectionate nature and as such they get on well with children of all ages. However any interaction between younger children and dogs should always be well supervised to make sure play time does not get too boisterous which could end up with someone getting scared or being hurt.
When well socialised from a young age an Irish Water Spaniel generally gets on well with other pets which includes the family cat. They are also known to get on well with other dogs. However an IWS would think nothing of chasing the neighbour's cat if they venture into a back garden.
The average life expectancy of an Irish Water Spaniel is between 9 and 15 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality diet to suit their ages.
Like so many other breeds the IWS is known to suffer from a few hereditary health issues which are worth knowing about if you are planning share your home with one of these active and good-looking dogs. The conditions that seem to affect the breed the most include the following:
It is worth noting that the Kennel Club average COI for the Irish Water Spaniel currently stands at 3.5%.
Irish Water Spaniel puppies would have been given their initial vaccinations before being sold but it is up to their new owners to make sure they have their follow-up shots in a timely manner with the vaccination schedule for puppies being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a dog should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A lot of vets these days recommend waiting until dogs are slightly older before spaying and neutering them which means they are more mature before undergoing the procedures. As such they advise neutering males and spaying females when they are between the ages of 6 to 9 months old and sometimes even when a dog is 12 months old.
Other vets recommend spaying and neutering dogs when they are 6 months old but never any earlier unless for medical reasons. With this said many breeds are different and it is always advisable to discuss things with a vet and then follow their advice on when a dog should be spayed or neutered.
As with other breed some Irish Water Spaniels gain weight after they have been spayed or neutered and it's important to keep an eye on a dog's waistline just in case they do. If a dog starts to put on weight it's important to adjust their daily calorie intake and to up the amount of exercise they are given. Older dogs too are more prone to gaining weight and again it's essential they be fed and exercised accordingly because obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years. The reason being that it puts a lot of extra strain on a dog's internal organs including the heart which could prove fatal.
Some Irish Water Spaniels are prone to suffering from allergies and it's important for a dog to see a vet sooner rather than later if one flares up. Allergies can be notoriously hard to clear up and finding the triggers can be challenging. With this said a vet would be able to make a dog with an allergy more comfortable while they try to find out the triggers which could include the following:
All responsible IWS breeders would ensure that their stud dogs are tested for known hereditary and congenital health issues known to affect the breed by using the following schemes:
Apart from the standard breeding restrictions for all Kennel Club recognised breeds there are no other breed specific breeding restrictions in place for the Irish Water Spaniel.
It is mandatory for all Kennel Club Assured breeders to use the following scheme on all their dogs and the KC strongly recommends that all other breeders follow suit:
As with any other breed Irish Water Spaniels need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in top condition. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this dogs need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
It's best to pick a puppy up when people are going to be around for the first week or so which is the time needed for a puppy to settle in. Puppy-proofing the home and garden means putting away any tools and other implements that a boisterous puppy might injure themselves on. Electric wires and cables must be put out of their reach because puppies love chewing on things. Toxic plants should be removed from flowerbeds and the home too.
Puppies need to sleep a lot to grow and develop as they should which means setting up a quiet area that's not too out of the way means they can retreat to it when they want to nap and it's important not to disturb them when they are sleeping. It's also a good idea to keep "playtime" nice and calm inside the house and to have a more active "playtime" outside in the garden which means puppies quickly learn to be less boisterous when they are inside.
The documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are certain items that new owners need to already have in the home prior to bringing a new puppy home. It's often a good idea to restrict how much space a puppy plays in more especially when you can't keep an eye on what they get up to bearing in mind that puppies are often quite boisterous which means investing in puppy gates or a large enough playpen that allows a puppy the room to express themselves while keeping them safe too. The items needed are therefore as follows:
All puppies are sensitive to noise including IWS puppies. It's important to keep the noise levels down when a new puppy arrives in the home. TVs and music should not be played too loud which could end up stressing a small puppy out making them withdrawn shy and timid.
As previously mentioned Irish Water Spaniel puppies would have been given their first vaccinations by the breeders but they must have their follow up shots which is up to their new owners to organise. The vaccination schedule for puppies is as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be fully up to date.
Older Irish Water Spaniel need lots of special care because as they reach their golden years they are more at risk of developing certain health concerns. Physically a dog's muzzle may start to go grey but there will be other noticeable changes too which includes the following:
Older dogs change mentally too which means their response time tends to be slower as such they develop the following:
Living with an Irish Water Spaniel in their golden years means taking on a few more responsibilities but these are easily managed and should include looking at their diet the amount of exercise they are given how often their dog beds need changing and keeping an eye on the condition of their teeth.
Older IWS need to be fed a good quality diet that meets their needs at this stage of their lives all the while keeping a close eye on a dog's weight. A rough feeding guide for older dogs is as follows bearing in mind they should be fed highly digestible food that does not contain any additives:
Older IWS don't need to be given the same amount of daily exercise as a younger dog but they still need the right amount of physical activity to maintain muscle tone and to prevent a dog from putting on too much weight. All dogs need access to fresh clean water and this is especially true of older dogs when they reach their golden years because they are more at risk of developing kidney disorders.
An Irish Water Spaniel's coat is oily to the touch and is made of dense curls and ringlets that cover virtually their entire body. As such they are quite high maintenance on the grooming front. Ideally these dogs need to be brushed at least twice a week to prevent any matts or tangles from forming. Because their coats are so dense it is also important to check dogs over for ticks and fleas on a regular basis too.
An Irish Water Spaniel is a high energy dog and therefore they need to be given a heap of physical exercise and mental stimulation every day for them to be truly happy well-rounded dogs. This means giving a dog a minimum of 2 hour's exercise a day. A shorter walk in the morning would be fine but a longer more interesting one in the afternoon is a must.
These dogs also like to be able to roam around a back garden as often as possible to really let off steam. However the fencing must be extremely secure to keep an IWS in because if they find a weakness in the fence they will soon escape out and get themselves into all sorts of trouble.
With this said Irish Water Spaniel puppies should not be given too much exercise because their joints and bones are still growing and too much pressure on them could result in causing a dog a few problems later in their lives. They should not be allowed to jump up or off furniture nor should they be allowed to run up and down the stairs because this puts too much pressure on their still growing joints and limbs.
If you get an Irish Water Spaniel puppy from a breeder they would give you a feeding schedule and it's important to stick to the same routine feeding the same puppy food to avoid any tummy upsets. You can change a puppy's diet but this needs to be done very gradually always making sure they don't develop any digestive upsets and if they do it's best to put them back on their original diet and to discuss things with the vet before attempting to change it again.
Older dogs are not known to be fussy or finicky eaters but this does not mean you can feed them a lower quality diet. It's best to feed a mature dog twice a day once in the morning and then again in the evening making sure it's good quality food that meets all their nutritional requirements. It's also important that dogs be given the right amount of exercise so they burn off any excess calories or they might gain too much weight which can lead to all sorts of health issues. Obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years so it's important to keep an eye on their waistline from the word go.
Puppies need to be fed a highly nutritious good quality diet for them to develop and grow as they should. As a rough guide a IWS puppy should be fed the following amounts every day making sure their meals are evenly spread out throughout the day and it's best to feed them 3 or 4 times a day:
Once a puppy is 12 months old they can be fed adult dog food.
Once fully mature an adult IWS should be fed a good quality diet to ensure their continued good health. As a rough guide an adult Irish Water Spaniel can be fed the following amounts every day:
If you are looking to buy an Irish Water Spaniel you would need to pay anything from £400 to over £800 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year-old IWS in northern England would be £23.43 a month for basic cover but for a lifetime policy this would set you back £44.71 a month (quote as of March 2018). When insurance companies calculate a pet's premium they factor in several things which includes where you live in the UK and a dog's age and whether they have been neutered or spayed amongst other things.
When it comes to food costs you need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry to feed your dog throughout their lives making sure it suits the different stages of their lives. This would set you back between £40 - £50 a month. On top of this veterinary costs would need to be factored if for anyone wanting to share a home with an Irish Water Spaniel and this includes their initial vaccinations their annual boosters the cost of neutering or spaying your dog when the time is right and their yearly health checks all of which quickly adds up to over a £1000 a year.
As a rough guide the average cost to keep and care for an Irish Water Spaniel would be between £70 to £100 a month depending on the level of insurance cover you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred healthy Kennel Club registered pedigree Irish Water Spaniel puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
Irish Water Spaniels can be hard to find and therefore healthy responsibly bred puppies can often command a lot of money. As such with Irish Water Spaniels there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:

The Irish Water Spaniel is one of the oldest spaniel breeds, originating in Ireland in the 1830s. Its ancestors likely include the now-extinct Southern and Northern Water Spaniels, along with the Poodle and Irish Setter. The breed was developed for water retrieval, particularly in marshes and lakes, making them excellent water dogs and retrievers. The Irish Water Spaniel has a unique curly, water-resistant, and dense double coat. The coat consists of tight ringlets on the body, except for the face and tail, which have smooth, shorter hair. The coat is typically liver-colored (a rich reddish-brown), and it doesn't shed much, making it somewhat hypoallergenic.
Irish Water Spaniels can suffer from Factor VII deficiency, degenerative myelopathy, and progressive rod-cone degeneration. They may have adverse reactions to sulfa antibiotics and to ivermectin. As for all breeds, genetic screening for hereditary conditions is recommended to assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Irish Water Spaniels are intelligent, affectionate, and energetic dogs. They are known for their strong hunting instincts and remarkable swimming abilities. They are loyal to their families and can be excellent with children. Early socialization and training are crucial to ensure they grow up to be well-adjusted and obedient pets. This breed thrives in an active environment where they can get plenty of mental and physical stimulation.
The Irish Water Spaniel is sometimes called the "IWS" for short. In the late 11th century, the breed was known as Shannon Spaniel, Rat Tail Spaniel, or Whip Tail Spaniel.It's believed that the Irish Water Spaniel was a favorite of Irish nobility and sportsmen during the 1800s.This breed's unique coat and appearance make it stand out among other spaniels and sporting breeds.The Irish Water Spaniel was used extensively for hunting and retrieving game from water, earning it the nickname "Water Dog."
