The Lakeland Terrier is one of the oldest of the Terrier breeds and was initially used to hunt animals that were considered vermin, such as otters, badgers, and even foxes. As these animals were sometimes larger than the dog themselves, these Terriers were bred with fearlessness in mind, but as fearless as they are on the hunt, they are somewhat more prone to separation anxiety than many other breeds. Lakelands are considered hypoallergenic due to their low shed rate, and they have very little smell. These little dogs do not require frequent baths, but weekly brushing and occasional clipping or stripping of the coat are needed to keep their coat healthy.
Terrier’s, in general, were bred to hunt and kill animals that were seen as vermin such as rats, badgers, otters, foxes, and weasels. Terriers became specialized by size, color, and temperament to hunt specific categories of vermin. Lakeland Terriers are one of the oldest of the working Terrier breeds, though they have gone by several different names throughout their long history. They originated as hunters of larger vermin in the Lake District of England and were originally known as Patterdale Terriers. They were bred initially to assist the farmers in the area by going to ground after badgers, otters, and foxes; not just to alert a human partner or to corner the animal, but to find and destroy their prey in order to keep them from raiding livestock. They were bred for gameness, which is defined as the trait of eagerness even in the face of substantial threat or injury, and this gameness has led some of these Terriers to follow badgers, otters, and foxes into their holes and pursue them for days. In 1912, a Terrier breed club was formed with the aim to recognize distinct breeds of terrier, including the Lakeland Terrier, which was known as the Cumberland County Terrier at that time. World War I slowed development of the breed, however, and an official breed standard was delayed until the 1920’s. It was at this time that the breed was given their current name. The Lakeland Terrier first appeared in the show ring in 1928 at Crufts in the United Kingdom, and was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1934.
The Lakeland Terrier is a solidly built but narrow dog, sturdy with a long neck and square proportions. They have a long, rectangular head with short V-shaped ears that fold down towards their face and either an impish or thoughtful but alert expression. The Lakeland Terrier’s coat is short and dense, consisting of both a soft undercoat and a slightly longer layer of dense, wiry fur that is accented by longer bushy fur found on the face and legs. They come in several recognized colors, including black, blue, brindle, grizzle, liver, red, red grizzle, wheaten, black and tan, blue and tan, liver and tan, and even grizzle and tan. These dogs were bred to hunt and kill animals that were often larger than they were, so they require a scissor bite and a very strong jaw. Historically, the tail was docked to protect the animal from injuring it while they were working, however, many owners today choose not to shorten this appendage. In either case, the tail is most frequently carried jauntily above the dog, but it should not curl over the back.
Lakeland Terriers are typically considered to be a hypoallergenic breed in large part due to their low shed rate, and although they do not require frequent bathing, they do require some specialized grooming. The coat requires weekly brushing and combing which serves to both remove dirt, tangles, and excess fur and also to redistribute the required natural oils throughout the fur. This breed’s coat also requires either clipping or stripping on a regular basis to keep it healthy. Those that choose to strip the coat can either use hand stripping or strip the animal using a stripping knife. A clipped coat is often easier for pet owners to maintain, but the texture and color of the animal’s coat may be altered. These dogs are an energetic breed, and they require a great deal of exercise to keep them at their happiest and healthiest. Although Lakeland Terriers are generally small, their abundant energy coupled with their tendency towards barking frequently make these dogs unsuited to the apartment lifestyle.
The Lakeland Terrier is intelligent and is quite capable of picking up on training. However, they also have an independent nature and a stubborn streak, so clear boundaries are imperative for a peaceful household. Lakelands are also suspicious of unknown dogs and people, and without appropriate socialization, these dogs can become aggressive with other dogs and sometimes with strangers. With their families, they are typically seen as playful and affectionate. They can make good companions for older children but should be very closely supervised with small children as they often exhibit guarding behavior and may not be tolerant of poking or prodding. Lakeland Terriers may have difficulty getting along with other dogs in the house, particularly other Terriers and dogs of the same sex and unless they are exposed to cats at a young age, they may pursue them as if they were prey. They will almost certainly go after any smaller animals that get loose in the house, such as mice, gerbils, and hamsters.

Among terriers, the Lakeland Terrier is perhaps the least well-known among dog enthusiasts. They look like a smaller, finer Airedale, but don’t let that fool you—the Lakeland is a scruffy, wiry-coated dog with a bubbly, social spirit all their own. Often called a big dog in a small dog’s body, the Lakeland Terrier is underappreciated due to their dwindling numbers, and they’re even at risk of being endangered. Let’s learn more about this little-known breed here, including what they’re like and how to care for them.
Height:
13 to 15 inches
Weight:
15 to 17 pounds
Lifespan:
12 to 15 years
Colors:
Tan, black, blue, wheaten, liver, red grizzle
Suitable for:
Active families with or without children, active singles or seniors
Temperament:
Loyal, loving, intelligent, easy to train, friendly, gets along with other pets
The Lakeland Terrier is the smallest tan and black terrier, with the largest being the Welsh and Airedale Terriers. Well-liked for their agreeable and intelligent personality, the Lakeland is sadly considered vulnerable by The Kennel Club.1 There simply aren’t as many breeders for the Lakeland these days, lowering the availability of the breed and endangering them in one fell swoop.

The Lakeland Terrier is rare and hard to find compared to other breeds, but you have a few resources at your disposal. The U.S. Lakeland Terrier Club may be able to help you find ethical breeders that specialize in the breed, and the AKC marketplace of breeders is always worth checking too. Social media groups devoted to the breed are yet another option but are much less reliable.
Locating an ethical and reputable Lakeland Terrier breeder is easier said than done. You have to watch out for shady breeders who are out to make a quick buck at the expense of poor dogs kept in deplorable conditions.

The Lakeland Terrier is good-natured, with an animated, happy-go-lucky spirit that fits well in any household. They’re a super social breed that needs to be with their people as often as possible and preferably involved too! They thrive with human contact and have a mischievous sense of humor you’ll fall in love with. Lakelands have an infectious pluck that spices things up around the house or on trips outdoors. Speaking of outdoors, they’re avid runners and aren’t afraid of the water either! the Lakeland Terrier is a versatile dog that’s content wherever you are.
They can have a bit of a stubborn streak and exhibit “selective deafness” when they really get interested in something, which will happen a lot because the Lakeland Terrier is a curious breed that gets bored easily without quality exercise and plenty of mental stimulation. They’re not a difficult dog by any means, but they definitely keep you on your toes with their unique brand of furry hyperactivity.
Yes, Lakeland Terriers are excellent family companions known for being patient with younger kids and having a sweeter demeanor versus other terriers. They’re loyal to their families and fearless toward strangers but have a polite and social temperament otherwise. Lakelands make fast friends and are amenable toward houseguests when they’re well-socialized, but they can be excitable, so you’ll have to teach them not to jump up on people.
It depends. The Lakeland Terrier has a strong prey drive, so they’re inclined to chase cats and smaller prey pets like rabbits. They can be socialized early to tolerate cats, however. As far as other dogs, Lakelands can be feisty but aren’t overly dominant. Again, it takes socialization early in puppyhood to teach them the rules of engagement as far as being a dog and interacting appropriately with furry housemates.

Lakeland Terrier puppies need a high-protein diet with 25% to 32% protein, while an adult needs between 18% and 22% protein. Both formulas are balanced with carbs, healthy fats, vitamins, and all those trace nutrients your dog needs to grow and thrive. Three to four small meals per day is a good rule of thumb for puppies, while adults do well with two or three meals per day.
Lakeland Terriers need about an hour of vigorous exercise each day to stay happy and healthy, which can be split up into walks, outside time, and indoor activities. They’re an active breed that can keep up with the best canine athletes, but they don’t realize their size sometimes. Fetch, tug-of-war, and agility courses are just a few possibilities you can employ to keep your Lakeland Terrier entertained on boring summer afternoons.
Mental stimulation indoors is key to managing the Lakeland Terrier’s high energy levels. Even when you think you’ve worn them out, they will start chewing on all your shoes or digging holes in the yard. These are signs you need to step up your game, so invest in some enrichment games like snuffle mats and Kong puzzle feeders, and begin a daily training routine if you haven’t already.
Lakeland Terriers are intelligent and trainable and learn commands quickly. The catch is that they can be stubborn when they don’t want to do something, requiring patience on your part. Your best behavioral tool during training is consistent positive reinforcement. For example, start by rewarding your Lakeland Terrier for responding to their name as a puppy. Once they get that down, you can move to more basic but still important commands like sit, stay, or heel.
Extensive but careful socialization is vital to forming a more well-rounded Lakeland Terrier. They’re well-mannered dogs in general, but they’re known for being willful. Begin socializing by taking your dog out on their leash and observing their reaction to stimuli like strangers, other dogs, and other animals like birds. If they bark or tug on the leash around another dog, for instance, stand still like a statue and appear indifferent. When they calm down, praise and reward them. You don’t have to use treats all the time, but they certainly do help streamline the process!
Lakeland Terriers are considered a non-shedding breed, so you’ll have to brush their coats regularly for about 15 to 30 minutes per week. A slicker brush or metal comb works best for this. You can also bathe them every 4 to 6 weeks. Their coat should be kept short to avoid any matting. Finally, be sure to keep their nails trimmed, and brush their teeth daily, if possible.
The Lakeland Terrier is typically a healthy breed, and good breeders are meticulous about screening their litters for potential inherited conditions. That said, you can never completely eliminate surprise health defects and conditions from cropping up later down the line, and some conditions are more common than others in this breed.
The physical difference between male and female Lakeland Terriers is less obvious than other breeds. Females average 13 to 14 inches tall and about 15 pounds, while males are a bit larger at 14 to 15 inches and 17 pounds on average. There are no major personality differences between the two sexes, and every individual has their own unique personality.

Bred in the Lake District, or “Lakeland,” in England, the Lakeland Terrier has gone by numerous monikers. Among them are the Patterson Terrier, the Fell Terrier, and the Cumberland. They’re related to a number of English terriers in Northern England bred for hunting small game.
Just 220 puppies of this breed were registered with the Kennel Club in 2016, leading them to be nearly endangered as a species. There are very few concerted breeding efforts devoted to them, sadly. Hopefully, more attention can be drawn to the Lakeland Terrier so the breed flourishes in the future.
The Lakeland is a relatively recent terrier breed, recognized as their own breed in 1934. They were distinguished from other terriers as a more agile fox hunter with fantastic burrowing ability, work ethic, and a tail-wagging affectionate nature at home. Unfortunately, their numbers have never been very high in England or elsewhere.

Lakeland Terriers will burrow their way into your heart with their affable, warm personality and wicked sense of humor. They can take some work to exercise and socialize properly but are well-suited to many households willing to deal with a big furry baby. There are precious few of these around, but hopefully, that will change in the near future.

The Lakeland Terrier is often referred to as a cheeky rascal and for good reason because these attractive little dogs boast being mischievous and have a real sense of humour. They are highly adaptable being just at home in a working environment as they are in a family environment providing they are given enough to do combined with lots of daily physical exercise. They are tireless affectionate and extremely loyal terriers that form a very strong bond with their families enjoying nothing more than being involved in everything that goes on in a household.
Sadly today these little dogs are not as popular as they once were and as such they have been placed on The Kennel Club’s list of vulnerable native breeds. However their numbers are rising although anyone wishing to share a home with a Lakeland Terrier would need to go on a waiting list for the pleasure of doing so because not many well-bred puppies are registered with the Kennel Club every year.
As their name suggests the Lakeland Terrier first appeared on the scene in the Lake District of England in the early 1900's where they were part of "fell packs" of working dogs. They were originally bred to work in mines and on farms but with hunting being a popular sport at the time many types of terriers were used in the field and it is from these dogs that the Lakeland evolved with people wanting to create the "perfect" terrier. The end result was the Lakeland Terrier a cheerful fearless little dog that boasted a tremendous amount of courage loyalty and stamina.
The breed was first exhibited at agricultural shows in the region which did not come under the Kennel Club rules but later the Lakeland Terrier Association was established in 1921 with an end goal being to set out a breed standard. By 1928 members of the now defunct association agreed that Kennel Club recognition should be sought and 3 years later in 1931 championship status was granted.
A year later in 1932 the Lakeland Terrier Club was established and breed enthusiasts began promoting the Lakeland throughout the country. Interest in the breed continued and their numbers rose right up to the beginning of World War II after which time their numbers feel dramatically. At the end of the war dog shows started up again which saw a renewed interest in the Lakeland Terrier. Subsequently breed numbers began to once again rise and by the 1950s Lakelands were winning many of the biggest shows in the land.
Sadly over time the breed has become less popular here in the UK and elsewhere in the world and the numbers of puppies registered with The Kennel Club every year has dwindled. As a result the breed has now been classed as a vulnerable native breed even though they make wonderful family pets and companions being ranked 71 in popularity out of 238 breeds on the Pets4homes website.
Height at the withers: Males 37 cm Females 37 cm
Average weight: Males 8 kg Females 7 kg
Their necks are slightly arched and shoulders well laid back with nice well-boned front legs. Their bodies are compact with these terriers having quite narrow chests and strong backs with powerful muscular hindquarters and strong back legs. Their feet are compact round and well padded. Their tails are set high which dogs carry gaily adding to their overall balance.
When it comes to their coat the Lakeland Terriers has a double coat with a dense and harsh outer coat and a thick extremely weather-resistant undercoat. The accepted breed colours for Kennel Club registration are as follows:
When a Lakeland Terrier moves their front and back legs are carried forward in a parallel motion with dogs holding their elbows perpendicular to their bodies and their stifles not tuning in or out. Lakelands show a good amount of drive in their hindquarters.
The Kennel Club frowns on any sort of exaggeration or departure from the breed standard and would judge a fault on how much it affects a dog's overall health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform.
Males should have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums and it is worth noting that a Lakeland Terrier can be a little shorter or taller as well as slightly lighter or heavier than set out in the Kennel Club breed standard which is given as a guideline only.
Lakelands are a good choice as family dogs but they are not the best choice for first time owners because they need to be trained and handled by people who are familiar with the breed or this type of hyper-active terrier. Males can be a little aggressive towards other dogs but their female counterparts tend to be more relaxed when they first meet any dogs. They hardy healthy and good around children providing they are well socialised from a young age.
They form very strong bonds with their families and in particular with the person who trains and looks after them. They can be a little wary and aloof when they are around people they don't know but rarely would a Lakeland show any sort of aggressive behaviour towards a stranger preferring to just keep their distance until they feel more comfortable about things.
They boast having a tremendous amount of stamina and being so intelligent these terriers can easily get bored if they are left to their own devices for longer periods of time. They love human companionship and are a great choice for people where one person usually stays home when everyone else is out of the house. As previously mentioned Lakelands have a tremendous amount of stamina and will happily keep going all day long but being adaptable are just as happy to sit indoors when the weather is bad outside.
When very excited by something Lakeland Terriers have the habit of trembling which is referred to as the "Terrier dither" which should not be mistaken for them being nervous or scared of something but rather the fact they are so exuberant about life. The good news is that as a dog ages they tend to quieten down and their trembling decreases over time.
Lakeland Terriers make great family pets but they are not the best choice for first time owners because they are better suited to people who are familiar with their specific needs and who have enough time to dedicate to an energetic canine companion that boasts a tremendous amount of stamina.
Lakeland Terriers were bred to hunt and go to ground after foxes and even in a home environment they still have a strong high prey drive and will happily chase anything that moves. As such care should always be taken when walking a Lakeland off the lead anywhere they might meet up with wildlife or livestock just in case a dog decides to give chase. Care should also be taken when introducing a Lakeland to smaller animals and pets for the first time.
Lakeland Terriers have a very playful and mischievous side to their natures and having so much energy as well as stamina they will happily run around a back garden chasing a ball and playing for hours on end. Gardens need to be ultra-secure to keep a Lakeland in because they are more than capable of squeezing through the smallest of gaps when the mood takes them. They love to entertain and be entertained which makes these small dogs all the more endearing and fun to live with.
Lakeland Terriers are highly adaptable dogs and providing they are given enough daily physical exercise combined with as much mental stimulation to prevent boredom from setting in they are just as happy living in an apartment as they are in a house. With this said like most other terrier breeds there is nothing a Lakeland enjoys more than to chase around a secure back garden whenever they can because they love to let of steam.
Lakeland Terriers form strong ties with their families and dogs are never very happy when they find themselves left on their own for longer periods of time. They are better suited to people who either work from home or in households where one person stays at home when everyone else is out so they are never alone for any length of time which could see a dog suffering from separation anxiety. This can lead to them being destructive around the home which is a dog's way of relieving any stress they are feeling and a way to keep themselves entertained.
Lakeland Terriers are known to be "barkers" which is a trait that needs to be gently curbed when dogs are still young and before it turns into a real problem. However some Lakelands will bark for the sake of it no matter how gently they are told not to when young and more especially if they are bored and not given enough physical daily exercise and mental stimulation to tire them out.
Most Lakeland like swimming and will take to the water whenever they can more especially when the weather is hot. However if anyone who owns a dog that does not like water should never force them to go in because it would just end up scaring them. With this said care should always be taken when walking a Lakeland Terrier off the lead anywhere near more dangerous watercourses just in case a dog decides to leap in and then needs rescuing.
Lakies are natural watchdogs and are always quick to let an owner know when there are strangers about or when something they don't like is going on in their environment. They tend to be wary and aloof around strangers preferring to keep their distance but rarely would a Lakeland show any sort of aggressive behaviour towards someone but they will stand their ground and bark incessantly to get their owners attention.
Lakelands are known to be highly intelligent terriers but they don't boast a very good attention span and they can be stubborn when the mood takes them which is why they are better suited to people who are familiar with the breed. Their training and socialisation must start as early as possible because if left too late these little dogs might start to show a more dominant and unruly side to their natures which can make dogs that much harder to handle. With this said they are quite capable of turning a deaf ear to a command if they find something more interesting to get involved in.
In the right hands and with the right amount of socialisation which must include introducing a Lakeland to as many new situations people other animals and dogs as possible once they are fully vaccinated as possible is essential. Much like other terriers they are quite sensitive dogs by nature and as such they do not respond well to any sort of harsh correction or heavy-handed training methods. They do answer well to clicker training and positive reinforcement but they need to be handled firmly and always fairly so that dogs don't get the upper hand.
The key to successfully training a Lakeland Terrier is to always be consistent and to persevere showing a young dog a lot of patience and understanding when their training starts in earnest which ideally should be when a terrier is around 10 weeks old. Many Lakelands have earned Kennel Club Good Citizen Scheme Gold Awards which is proof they can be trained to be obedient well-behaved terriers when they are given the right sort of direction and guidance.
Lakeland puppies are very cute and it is all too easy to let them get away with things at this stage in their lives. However owners must start as they mean to go on because spoiling a Lakeland puppy would lead to a dog showing a more unruly and dominant side to their natures which can make them a lot harder to handle and live with. Owners must set out ground rules for a Lakeland puppy bearing mind that being so intelligent they will always test these from time to time just for the fun of it. The first commands a puppy needs to be taught are as follows:
Lakelands are highly adaptable terriers and as such they are perfectly at home in a family environment and if anything they thrive on being involved in everything that goes on in a household. They are happy characters by nature and generally behave nicely around children providing they have grown up together. However any interaction between dogs and the kids must be supervised by an adult to make sure playtime does not get too boisterous which could see a child being knocked over and frightened.
These terriers are known to be fearless but rarely would a Lakeland start a fight unless they feel threatened in any way. However they often do not tolerate living with other dogs of the same sex more especially if they are terrier-types too. Care should always be taken when they meet any smaller animals and pets because their strong instinct might just kick in with disastrous results. If they have grown up with a cat in the home they will usually tolerate being around them but a Lakeland would think nothing of chasing cats that venture into their garden.
The average life expectancy of a Lakeland Terrier is between 9 and 15 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality diet to suit their ages.
Lakeland Terriers are known to be healthy and robust dogs that do not appear to be affected by many of the hereditary health issues that afflict many other breeds. However the conditions that seems to affect the breed the most is as follows:
Lakie puppies would have been given their initial vaccinations before being sold but it is up to their new owners to make sure they have their follow-up shots in a timely manner with the vaccination schedule for puppies being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a dog should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A lot of vets these days recommend waiting until dogs are slightly older before spaying and neutering them which means they are more mature before undergoing the procedures. As such they advise neutering males and spaying females when they are between the ages of 6 to 9 months old and sometimes even when a dog is 12 months old
Other vets recommend spaying and neutering dogs when they are 6 months old but never any earlier unless for medical reasons. With this said many breeds are different and it is always advisable to discuss things with a vet and then follow their advice on when a dog should be spayed or neutered.
Some Lakelands gain weight after they have been spayed or neutered and it's important to keep an eye on a dog's waistline just in case they do. If a dog starts to put on weight it's important to adjust their daily calorie intake and to up the amount of exercise they are given. Older Lakies too are prone to gaining weight and again it's essential they be fed and exercised accordingly because obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years. The reason being that it puts a lot of extra strain on a dog's internal organs including the heart.
Lakies are not known to suffer from allergies but should a skin issue flare up it's important to have a dog examined by a vet sooner rather than later just in case there is an underlying health issue causing the problem.
All responsible Lakeland Terrier breeders would ensure that their stud dogs are tested for known hereditary and congenital health issues known to affect the breed by using the following scheme:
Apart from the standard breeding restrictions for all Kennel Club registered breeds there are no other breed specific breeding restrictions in place for the Lakeland Terrier.
Currently there are no BVA/KC screening schemes available for the Lakeland Terrier but breeders are now advised to have stud dogs tested for the following:
As with any other breed Lakeland Terriers need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in top condition. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this dogs need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
It's best to pick a puppy up when people are going to be around for the first week or so which is the time needed for a puppy to settle in. Puppy-proofing the home and garden means putting away any tools and other implements that a boisterous puppy might injure themselves on. Electric wires and cables must be put out of their reach because puppies love chewing on things. Toxic plants should be removed from flowerbeds and the home too.
Puppies need to sleep a lot to grow and develop as they should which means setting up a quiet area that's not too out of the way means they can retreat to it when they want to nap and it's important not to disturb them when they are sleeping. It's also a good idea to keep "playtime" nice and calm inside the house and to have a more active "playtime" outside in the garden which means puppies quickly learn to be less boisterous when they are inside.
The documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are certain items that new owners need to already have in the home prior to bringing a new puppy home. It's often a good idea to restrict how much space a puppy plays in more especially when you can't keep an eye on what they get up to bearing in mind that puppies are often quite boisterous which means investing in puppy gates or a large enough playpen that allows a Lakie puppy the room to express themselves while keeping them safe too. The items needed are therefore as follows:
All puppies are sensitive to noise including Lakeland Terrier puppies. It's important to keep the noise levels down when a new puppy arrives in the home. TVs and music should not be played too loud which could end up stressing a small puppy out.
As previously mentioned Lakie puppies would have been given their first vaccinations by the breeders but they must have their follow up shots which is up to their new owners to organise. The vaccination schedule for puppies is as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be
Older Lakeland Terriers need lots of special care because as they reach their golden years they are more at risk of developing certain health concerns. Physically a dog's muzzle may start to go grey but there will be other noticeable changes too which includes the following:
Older dogs change mentally too which means their response time tends to be slower as such they develop the following:
Living with a Lakie in their golden years means taking on a few more responsibilities but these are easily managed and should include taking a look at their diet the amount of exercise they are given how often their dog beds need changing and keeping an eye on the condition of their teeth.
Older Lakelands need to be fed a good quality diet that meets their needs at this stage of their lives all the while keeping a close eye on a dog's weight. A rough feeding guide for older Lakies is as follows bearing in mind they should be fed highly digestible food that does not contain any additives:
Older Lakeland Terriers don't need to be given the same amount of daily exercise as a younger dog but they still need the right amount of physical activity to maintain muscle tone and to prevent a dog from putting on too much weight. All dogs need access to fresh clean water and this is especially true of older dogs when they reach their golden years because they are more at risk of developing kidney disorders.
When it comes to keeping their coats looking tidy and a dog's skin in good condition Lakelands need to be groomed on a regular basis to prevent any matts knots and tangles from forming. Special attention should be paid to a dog's muzzle which tends to get a bit grubby after they’ve eaten. If food deposits build up around their mouths it provides the perfect environment for bacteria to flourish which can lead to an infection setting in.
Because Lakeland's don't shed their coats need to be hand stripped several times a year to keep things tidy and this is best left up to a professional dog groomer. It makes keeping a dog's coat looking good easier in between visits to a grooming parlour. It's also important to check a dog's ears on a regular basis and to clean them when necessary. If too much wax builds up in a dog's ears it can lead to a painful infection which can be hard to clear up. In short prevention is often easier than cure when it comes to ear infections.
Lakelands are high energy terriers much like many of their other cousins and as such they need to be given the right amount of exercise every day. Because they are intelligent they also need lots of mental stimulation to be truly happy well-rounded and obedient dogs. Ideally they need at minimum of one hour's exercise a day but more would suit these active dogs down to the ground. They boast having a tremendous stamina and will happily walk behind a horse for hours. However Lakelands true to their terrier natures can sometimes go off and ignore the recall command which is especially true if a dog has spotted something more interesting in the distance.
A shorter walk in the morning would be fine but a longer more interesting one in the afternoon is a must. These dogs also like to be able to roam around a back garden as often as possible so they can really let off steam. However the fencing must be extremely secure to keep these dogs in because if they find a weakness in the fence they will soon escape out and get into all sorts of trouble.
With this said Lakeland puppies should not be given too much exercise because their joints and bones are still growing and too much pressure on them could result in causing a dog a few problems later in their lives. They should not be allowed to jump up or off furniture nor should they be allowed to run up and down the stairs because this puts too much pressure on their still growing joints and limbs.
If you get a Lakeland Terrier puppy from a breeder they would give you a feeding schedule and it's important to stick to the same routine feeding the same puppy food to avoid any tummy upsets. You can change a puppy's diet but this needs to be done very gradually always making sure they don't develop any digestive upsets and if they do it's best to put them back on their original diet and to discuss things with the vet before attempting to change it again.
Older dogs are not known to be fussy or finicky eaters but this does not mean you can feed them a lower quality diet. It's best to feed a mature dog twice a day once in the morning and then again in the evening making sure it's good quality food that meets all their nutritional requirements. It's also important that dogs be given the right amount of exercise so they burn off any excess calories or they might gain too much weight which can lead to all sorts of health issues. Obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years so it's important to keep an eye on their waistline from the word go.
Puppies need to be fed a highly nutritious good quality diet for them to develop and grow as they should. As a rough guide a Lakeland Terrier puppy can be fed the following amounts every day making sure their meals are evenly spread out throughout the day and it's best to feed them 3 or 4 times a day:
Once a puppy is 11 months old they can be fed adult dog food.
Once fully mature an adult Lakeland Terrier must be fed a good quality diet to ensure their continued good health. As a rough guide an adult Lakeland can be fed the following amounts every day:
If you are looking to buy a Lakeland Terrier you may have to go on a waiting list because not many puppies are registered with The Kennel Club every year. You would need to pay anything from £200 to over £700 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year-old Lakeland Terrier in northern England would be £21.56 a month for basic cover but for a lifetime policy this would set you back £43.76 a month (quote as of October 2017). When insurance companies calculate a pet's premium they factor in several things which includes where you live in the UK and a dog's age and whether they have been neutered or spayed.
When it comes to food costs you need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry to feed your dog throughout their lives making sure it suits the different stages of their lives. This would set you back between £20 - £30 a month. On top of this you would need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Lakeland Terrier and this includes their initial vaccinations their annual boosters the cost of neutering or spaying your dog when the time is right and their yearly health checks all of which quickly adds up to over a £800 a year.
As a rough guide the average cost to keep and care for a Lakeland Terrier would be between £50 to £80 a month depending on the level of insurance cover you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred healthy Kennel Club registered pedigree Lakeland Terrier puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
Lakeland Terriers are an extremely popular breed both in the UK and elsewhere in the world which means that well-bred puppies command a lot of money. As such with Lakelands there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:
--------------------------------------------------
The Lakeland Terrier was first bred to hunt the foxes that preyed on sheep during the lambing season in Northern England’s Lake District. Today’s Lakies, as these lively, feisty little dogs are nicknamed, are affectionate, friendly, and self-confident. Even though these are purebred dogs, some may still end up in the care of shelters or rescues. Always prioritize adoption if this is the breed for you.
The Lakeland Terrier is an affectionate dog when it comes to the humans in their life. Even though they have high energy and exercise needs, their small size can help them adapt to apartment living, so long as they get plenty of physical activity. Their adaptability may be worth keeping in mind for for any city-dwelling future pet parent thinking of adding a Lakeland Terrier puppy to their home. For a house with a backyard, a high, sturdy fence is a must to prevent roaming and wildlife chasing. These dogs respond well to confident pet parents who can set boundaries. Give this pup lots of patient training and active playtime, and you’ll have a loving, furry family member.
When considering a Lakeland Terrier, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you’re on the search for Lakeland Terrier puppies and decide to purchase, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Lakeland Terrier breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Click here for more information on this characteristic

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

Created to be a practical working terrier, the Lakeland hails from England’s beautiful but rugged and mountainous Lake District, where his job was to hunt and kill the foxes that plagued farmers. He’s small, square, and sturdy, with a deep, relatively narrow body that allows him to squeeze into rocky dens after his prey. Lakeland Terriers are characterized by a rectangular head, an intense and sometimes impish expression, v-shaped ears that fold over, and a docked tail carried up. They have a double coat: a thick, hard topcoat to protect them from thorns and a dense undercoat to keep them warm in the hail, sleet, snow, and rain of their home region. Alert and ready to go, Lakies often look as if they’re standing on their tiptoes. The Lakeland is cheerful and energetic, but like any self-respecting terrier, he can be willful and determined. Nonetheless, his people are enchanted by his charm, intelligence, and sense of humor. Lakies have a lot of courage and confidence. They generally get along well with children and other dogs, but are reserved with strangers. Being terriers, they are prone to chasing small animals, so it’s advisable to socialize them with cats and other small animals from an early age.
Like many terriers, Lakelands can be difficult to housetrain, and they have their own thoughts about what constitutes proper behavior, which may not be the same as yours. Also, some like to dig, bark quite a lot, and guard their toys and food. Therefore, they need to have firm, patient training from an early age. They are intelligent dogs, so be sure that your training has lots of variety to keep them challenged. Also, you must be fair in your training techniques. All terriers have a sense of fairness and are willing to be corrected when it is merited. But if the correction is harsh or undeserved, they are likely to growl and rebel. Using proper training techniques, you’ll find that your Lakeland is quick to learn. Because he has a great deal of energy, you might want to consider training him for obedience or agility. Lakies are small dogs, so it would seem that they would be good for apartment dwellers. Unfortunately, their propensity for barking might rule that out, unless you put in the time to train them to be quiet. Grooming is moderately time-consuming. They need to be brushed two or three times a week and “stripped” periodically to keep their coats in proper condition. Although they have many fine qualities, Lakelands are uncommon and aren’t readily available. Expect to spend some time on a waiting list, as much as six months to a year, if you want one of these charming terriers.
Distinctive Appearance: Lakeland Terriers are easily recognized by their distinctive appearance. They have a wiry double coat that comes in various colors, including black and tan, red, wheaten, blue, grizzle, and liver. Their eyebrows and beard give them a unique and expressive face.
Small and Sturdy: These terriers are small in size but sturdy in build. They typically weigh between 15 to 17 pounds (6.8 to 7.7 kilograms) and stand about 13 to 14 inches (33 to 36 centimeters) tall at the shoulder.
Fearless Nature: Lakeland Terriers are known for their fearless and confident nature. They were originally bred to hunt and control vermin, and they have a strong prey drive.
Intelligence: These dogs are intelligent and quick learners. They thrive on mental stimulation and enjoy problem-solving tasks and training sessions.
Energy and Playfulness: Lakies are energetic and playful dogs. They have a lot of energy to burn and enjoy outdoor activities and playtime with their owners.
Alert Watchdogs: Despite their small size, Lakeland Terriers make excellent watchdogs. They are alert and vocal, and they will bark to alert their owners to potential intruders or disturbances.
Strong Bonds with Family: Lakeland Terriers are known for forming strong bonds with their families. They are affectionate and loyal to their owners and enjoy being part of family activities.
Versatility: These terriers excel in various dog sports and competitions, including agility, obedience, and earthdog trials. Their agility and intelligence make them competitive in these activities.
Clean and Odorless: Many Lakeland Terrier owners appreciate that they tend to be relatively clean dogs and are known for their lack of a strong doggy odor.
The Lakeland Terrier was born in the county of Cumberland in England’s beautiful but treacherously rugged Lake District near the Scottish border. The Lake District is known for its beautiful hills and mountains. Beatrix Potter had a farm here, where she, like many of the farmers in this region, raised a rare hardy breed of sheep called Herdwicks. The terrain is harsh and rugged, and sheep farms dotted the scenic countryside. A large, aggressive type of fox called a Westmoreland fox preys on the sheep, especially during the lambing season, which happens to coincide with the time that the foxes are weaning their cubs. The Lakeland’s job was to “go to ground” when the fox ran into its burrow and kill it. Some of the game little terriers also were owned by miners and other workers who used them for sport, such as badger digging, rabbiting, ratting, and fox hunting. Eventually, “meets” were held where people could show off their dogs.
The Lakelands first were classified as colored working terriers to differentiate them from white terriers (even though sometimes both were out of the same litter). Lakelands are related to several terrier breeds, including the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now extinct), the Dandie Dinmont and Bedlington Terriers, and the Border Terrier. They are one of the oldest working terrier breeds still in use today. In 1921 the Lakeland Terrier Association was formed in England. They were first exhibited in England under a variety of names, including the Fell and Patterdale Terrier. The American Kennel Club first registered a Lakeland Terrier, Eaton What A Lad Of Howtown, in 1934, by which time it had its current name and was a regular in the show rings both in the U.S. and England. Breeders worked to produce dogs that would have the looks to win in the show ring while retaining the working characteristics that were so prized. They appear to have succeeded in grand style.
Lakelands have won most of the major shows and awards that can be found around the world. The first great champion Lakeland Terrier was named Rogerholme Recruit, who won Best in Show at the prestigious 1963 Crufts dog show England. Just three years later, in 1967, another English Lakeland Terrier named Stingray of Derryabahwon Best in Show at the 1967 Crufts and Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in 1968. In the early seventies, Ch Special Edition won dozens of Bests in Show, and another Lakie named Ch Jo-Ni’s Red Baron of Crofton won 73 Bests in Show, with the last being awarded at the 1976 at Westminster’s Centennial dog show. Several other Lakeland Terriers also have proven the appeal of the breed in the show ring by winning multiple Bests in Show, Groups, and other awards. In the early 1990s, an outstanding Lakie named Ch. Revelry’s Awesome Blossom, owned by Jean L. Heath and comedian Bill Cosby, emerged. Her remarkable show record included more than 100 All-Breed Bests-in-Show, making her among the top-winning show dogs of all time.
The compact and athletic Lakeland Terrier is typically 13 1/2 to 14 1/2 inches tall, and weighs 15 to 17 pounds.
The typical Lakeland is bold and friendly. He’s described as having a “cock of the walk” attitude, but he’s neither overly aggressive or argumentative. All terrier, he’s curious about everything, intelligent, and entertaining. He’s usually reserved with strangers but loves his family, especially the kids. With other dogs, he might not start a fight, but he certainly won’t back down from one. Alert and self-confident, he makes an excellent watchdog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who’s beating up his littermates or the one who’s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who’s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you’re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.
Like every dog, Lakelands need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they’re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Lakeland puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Lakeland Terriers are a hardy breed and don’t suffer from any known hereditary health problems. To help ensure that you get a healthy Lakeland puppy, choose a breeder who abides by the U. S. Lakeland Terrier Club code of ethics. However, some conditions to be aware of include:
Hip Dysplasia: This is a hereditary condition in which the hip joint doesn’t develop properly, leading to arthritis and discomfort.
Patellar Luxation: This condition involves the kneecap slipping out of its normal position, which can cause lameness and pain.
Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a genetic eye disorder that can eventually lead to blindness.
Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which can cause lameness and pain in the hip joint.
The Lakeland should live in the home with his people, not outdoors. Because of his small size, the Lakeland Terrier is good for apartment life so long as you train him not to bark at every noise he hears. He’s active indoors and will do all right without a yard so long as you provide him with one or two daily walks of 20 to 30 minutes. If he has a yard, it should be securely fenced as he’s a capable digger and escape artist. Don’t count on an underground electronic fence to keep him confined; the threat of a shock is nothing to a tough terrier who wants to go after something. Ideally, he should be able run and play off leash regularly in a safe area. Keep the Lakie on leash when you walk him. You never know when his terrier instinct to hunt will kick in. With his independent nature, the Lakie can be a challenge to train. Keep your sense of humor at the ready, as well as a large supply of patience. Be firm and consistent, but use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play to get the most out of him. Keep lessons short, sweet, and entertaining, and you’ll find that your Lakeland is quite intelligent and capable of learning whatever you can teach.
Housetraining a Lakeland Terrier puppy can sometimes be a problem with this breed. Patience and consistency are musts. Take him out to potty first thing in the morning, after every meal, after naps and playtime, and just before bedtime. Reward him every time he potties outdoors. Crate training helps as well. Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Lakeland doesn’t get into things he shouldn’t. Like every dog, Lakies can be destructive as puppies. Crate training at a young age will also help your Lakeland accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Lakeland in a crate all day long, however. It’s not a jail, and he shouldn’t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he’s sleeping at night. Lakies are people dogs, and they aren’t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. The Lakeland excels as a watchdog, but he can be noisy. Keep this in mind if he’ll be living in an apartment or condo community.
Recommended daily amount: 1 cup of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.
How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don’t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you’ll need to shake into your dog’s bowl. Keep your adult Lakeland in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you’re unsure whether he’s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can’t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Lakeland, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Lakeland Terriers have a thick, hard topcoat and a soft undercoat. When he’s hand stripped to show his outline, he has a neat, workmanlike appearance. In the show ring, the coat on the head, ears, forechest, shoulders, and behind the tail is trimmed short and smooth. The coat on the body is about half an inch to an inch long and can be straight or slightly wavy. The long hair on the legs, known as furnishings, gives the legs a cylindrical appearance. The hair on the face is trimmed but left longer over the eyes to enhance the head’s rectangular appearance. Lakies come in many colors, including blue, black, liver (a deep reddish-brown), red, and wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Some have a tan saddle that covers the back of the neck, back, sides, and up the tail, making them blue and tan, black and tan, or liver and tan. They can also be what’s called red grizzle or grizzle and tan. A red grizzle Lakeland has a saddle that’s a deep, rich red over a tan base. Grizzle is a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs. Puppies often are born dark.
Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Lakeland’s nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they’re too long. The earlier you introduce your Lakie to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he’ll be used to it. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Lakies love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but certain rules apply to child-dog interactions. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he’s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog’s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Lakelands can get along well with other pets, especially if they’re introduced to them in puppyhood. They shouldn’t be aggressive toward strange dogs, but they won’t back down from them either. They may chase outdoor cats as well as squirrels and other wildlife, and they probably shouldn’t be trusted alone with pocket pets such as hamsters and gerbils.
Lakeland Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption or fostering.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems, and they may not socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.

Dylan the clever, adventurous, mischievous, playful, loyal, yet selectively deaf Lakeland Terrier at about 22 months
"LAKE"-luhnd TAIR-ee-uhr
The Lakeland Terrier is small and sturdy. It is squarely proportioned, much like the Welsh Terrier, but smaller. His body is deep and narrow and his head is balanced and rectangular. The muzzle is strong and the nose is black and can be liver colored on liver dogs. The ears are small and V-shaped, folding over. The eyes are moderately small with an oval outline. Eye color comes in black, brown or dark hazel. The stop is barely noticeable. The front legs are strong and straight when viewed from the front. The teeth are relatively large and meet in a level, edge-to-edge or a slightly overlapping scissors bite. The Lakeland Terrier has a double coat. The outer coat is hard and wiry in texture and the undercoat is close to the skin and soft. The hair is usually cut so it is longer on the muzzle and legs. Coat colors come in solid blue, black, liver, red and wheaten. It also comes with saddle markings, where a second color covers the back of the neck, back, sides and up the tail. Saddle colors may be blue, black, liver or varying shades of grizzle. Puppies are often born black and change coloring as they grow. The tail is set high and generally docked.
The Lakeland Terrier is an alert, lively, cheerful, loving and affectionate dog. This breed loves children. Confident and brave, it needs unyielding training along with a firm, consistent, confident pack leader. The Lakeland Terrier likes to dig and may be a barker, and needs to be told to hush if it becomes obsessive. This breed may be difficult to housebreak, but tends to learn quite easily otherwise. Make sure that the training is full of variety and offers the dog a challenge. You will find the dog quickly learns what you want from him. The Lakeland Terrier gets along well with other dogs if properly socialized. Socialize your dog when it is still young with other dogs, cats and other animals so it does not fight or chase them when it is older. Dogs that are allowed to take over the home will become feisty, willful, determined, and will tend to guard their toys and food. They may become unsure around strangers. They may also become dog aggressive and bark obsessively, as they try and rule those around them. These are NOT Lakeland Terrier traits, but rather human induced traits, brought on by the lack of leadership from the people around them. Dogs that do develop Small Dog Syndrome, will change for the better as soon as the dog starts getting firm, consistent rules to follow, limits as to what it is and is not allowed to do, along with a daily pack walk. In other words, do not be a meek owner, be a real pack leader.
Like all dogs, a Lakeland's  housebreaking success is very much a function of how the puppy was raised.  Puppies raised commercially in wire crates are MUCH harder to housebreak.  Most of the Lakelands that end up in  breed rescue come from large-scale breeders raising pups in wire crates. Common reasons for surrender are dog aggression and housebreaking issues. A well-bred, well-raised Lakeland that has an owner who satisfies the dogs natural instincts do not have these issues and are a pleasure to own.

The Lakeland Terrier breed dates back to the 1800s and is one of the oldest terrier breeds that is still around today. The breed was originally called the Patterdale Terrier, however it is a separate breed from the Patterdale Terrier that we know of today. The Lakeland was developed by crossing the Bedlington Terrier, with the Old English Wirehaired Terrier in the Lake District of England. The dog was used to prevent fox and other vermin from destroying the crops and herds. It hunted den animals such as badger, fox and otter. It was able to hunt on uneven terrain, woods, fields and water. It chased and killed the quarry. The Lakeland was recognized as a breed in 1921 and by the AKC in 1934. It is still used for hunting, as a companion and as a show dog. Some of the Lakeland Terrier’s talents include: hunting, tracking and watchdog.

"This is a picture I took of "Buttercup", a 2.5 year old female Lakeland Terrier. She loves to chase balls and bring them back, incessantly. We have another Lakeland terrier, named Athena, who also loves to chase the balls, but doesn't bring them back as reliably. Buttercup makes a great photo subject because she so reliably brings the balls back to a person. If I am the only one around and I have the camera, I can get a great shot of her bringing the ball back every time. She is also good at finding hidden balls with treats in them, she will search the yard incessantly until she finds it, using her nose and eyes."
