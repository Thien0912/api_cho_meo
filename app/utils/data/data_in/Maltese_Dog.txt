Do Maltese dogs need a lot of exercises?
If you notice any weight gain, consult your veterinarian and make a diet plan. Reduce unhealthy food and snacks, and measure the Maltese weight regularly.
Brushing the dog's coat is useful to reduce shedding. Ears and eyes should be cleaned regularly to avoid infections.
Don't skip the seasonal flea treatment too. Dog nail trimming and dog bath can be helpful sometimes.
Check the local pet store for dog grooming supplies and find the best dog shampoo to keep its coat healthy and give your dog a pleasant experience of a dog bath.
If you don't have the time, skill, or money to take care of your Maltese, search for a dog groomer or clipping service in your area and book an appointment.
Maybe you're lucky to have a dog boarding service that includes grooming or walk-in dog bath places nearby.
If you notice any change in your dog's drooling habit, you should contact a vet as soon as possible.

For example, short-haired dog breeds can go a very long time in between baths. These short-haired breeds shed regularly and that shedding works to naturally remove excess dirt and oil. So unless your weenie dog got into the garbage can, you can probably hold off on a bath for a while.

The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color.
The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the female’s discharge changes for vivid red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating.
The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts about six months.
Once a year.
The origins of this small, refined, joyful, and long-haired dog can be traced back over at least 28 centuries. It is possible that the Maltese are the oldest European toy breed. There are many theories of the exact origin, but none of them is certain. Many believe the breed was developed in the Isle of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea from Spitz- or Spaniel-type dogs. Others believe they were developed in Italy, and still, others believe that they were originally from Asia and had a part in developing many of the smaller Asian dogs. However, one thing is certain: the Maltese were widespread in the Ancient Mediterranean cultures, even before the Christian era.
According to the hieroglyphics, they were present in Ancient Egypt. Women were given Maltese dogs as companion dogs. Egyptians believed that these dogs had the power of healing and would place one on the pillow of an ill person. This inspired one of its names, ‘the Comforter’.
Although, this dog breed was found even on Ancient Greek pottery and was mentioned by the famous Greek philosopher, Aristotle, their ancestors were naturalized in Malta by the Phoenicians. Unlike many small breeds, the Maltese were not bred down from larger sizes, it has always been a very small dog.
The Maltese kept its upper-class-like prestige, in the 15th century the breed spread to France, where they became a favorite of the royal. They appeared also in England, too, where they were treated like royalty and depicted in Renaissance paintings.
In order to breed them even smaller, they were crossbred with other small dogs. Because of this attempt, the breed was almost destroyed but in the aim of saving them, the breeders mixed the Maltese with poodles, miniature spaniels, and East Asian miniature dogs. As a result, many other breeds were born, the Maltese became ancestors of the Bichon Frise, Bolognese, and Havanese.
Among other breeds, the Maltese was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888. Maltese are one of the most popular breeds among spectators at dog shows and frequently win the Toy Group. They also have an excellent record in the "Best in Show" competition.

Maltese are an ancient dog breed who were bred to be a companion dog and to look gloriously pretty, sat on their master’s lap or poking out of their mistress’s bosom. He is part of the toy group, and in 2021 he was ranked by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as the 37th most popular dog in America.
This popular pooch has always been a big hit with families across the world and for good reason. He offers a well-balanced doggy personality who is playful, fun, and calm when he fancies an afternoon snooze. He makes a great little watchdog, but he is also sociable with friends and not overly protective compared to most other toy breeds.
So whether you are here because you want to educate yourself on this little guy, or you are researching whether the Maltese is the right dog for you, you have come to the right place. In this guide, you will learn about his personality, what you can expect from him, and what he expects from you, as well as a few quirky facts.
So, sit back, relax, and let us explain exactly why you need this little guy in your life!

Firstly, whatever you do, do not fall for the Maltese teacup trap. In recent years it has become fashionable to breed dogs in tiny teacup sizes, named because they can fit into a teacup. This is not healthy, and no matter how cute he is, dogs who are specifically bred to be so small are usually riddled with health problems. Their parents are either the runts of their litters or they suffered from a growth abnormality, so their teacup puppies are usually very sick. Reputable breeders do not sell teacup breeds, and if you find a teacup pooch, walk away immediately. They are not rare; they are not exotic; they are unwell and unhealthy dogs.
Healthy Maltese dogs are still very tiny, so you need to be aware of this when he is around you because he can be a trip hazard for sure. Your yard needs to be secured because he could easily wriggle out from under the fence following his curious nose. Though he is small, he is merry and bold, and always up for an exciting adventure or game of fetch. He is not a typical toy dog in that he will not want to sit around all day, so expect a little bit of canine fun from him.
The Maltese is a great option for those dog lovers who have slight dog allergies because he is listed as a hypoallergenic dog by the AKC. A hypoallergenic dog’s coat hardly sheds and therefore does not trigger allergies anywhere near as much as most other dogs. Bear in mind that no dog is 100% allergenic, meaning if you have serious doggy allergies, do not count on the Maltese pup to solve all your problems. But dogs on this list are very appealing to families with slight dog allergies.
The Maltese has fascinated people around the world for millennia. The Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all worshipped the Maltese for his powers and charms, and we are still to this day in love with this pooch. He is a well-balanced dog who offers a little bit of every adored canine trait, and this is possibly why we adore him so much.
He is devoted to his owners and would happily spend 24/7 with them. You are in for a lot of cuddles and doggy kisses with the Maltese around. If you are ever feeling down or need a hot water bottle, he will be the first to sign up for the job. His round puppy dog eyes and cheeky little smile will melt your heart every time, and it will be very hard to resist him. There is a reason why he is thought of as the oldest lapdog in the world – because he is so good at it.
When he has had his cuddle fix, you’ll probably find him running around the yard, looking for a game to play, or finding something to sniff. He is an adventurous lil’ pooch who is happy to adventure out, but he is probably not brave enough to trail off by himself. He is a curious pooch, but only happy to adventure knowing that you are by his side.
The Maltese is an intelligent dog. He is not as stubborn or as independent as most small dogs, which makes him one of the most trainable dogs in the toy group. This does not mean that he will be 100% obedient, and if this is a trait that you are looking for in a dog, you should consider another breed. Thankfully, he is happy to participate in the majority of your training sessions, and with a treat in-hand, you’ll probably persuade him every time.
The Maltese is happy in apartments, large homes, or anything in between. This versatile dog is content just as long as he can spend a lot of time with his family.
Although the Maltese will bark at strangers, he does not do it excessively. Unlike most other toy dogs, he makes an okay watchdog and not a great one, and you’ll more likely find him chilling in the kennel outside, watching strangers approach the house. This is great if you live somewhere with noise restrictions, but if you are seeking a talkative or yappy toy dog, the Maltese is not the best dog for the job.
A well-socialized Maltese is a pleasant and polite pooch who does well in a multi-dog household. Just as long as he gets his fair share of attention, he is happy with whatever the family dynamics happen to be. He also gets along well with other animals and rarely has a problem with cats. The Maltese makes a great family addition for those that love animals and always have pets around. He is an adaptable dog who is happy to slot himself into the mix.

Inviting a Maltese pup or older Maltese rescue into your home is exciting, but it is also a serious decision to make. Although the Maltese is a relatively easy dog to care for compared to many others, there are a few things that you need to know about him.
Being a toy dog, he has certain nutritional needs that need to be met. Firstly, he needs to be fed more often than the average dog. Smaller dogs are at a heightened risk of suffering from Hyperglycemia and feeding little and often helps to stabilize his blood sugar levels.
Secondly, you will need to feed him a kibble that is specifically designed for toy and small breed puppies, adults, or seniors. They have the optimum nutrients for small breed dogs, as well as being much smaller in size so that he can eat the kibble pieces much easier.
Malteses are known to be fussy when it comes to mealtime. You can try adding a little warm water or chicken broth to his dried kibble to release the aroma or add wet food to the mix. Give him time to get used to his new foods, and do not switch it to fatty human food; otherwise, you risk that he will become overweight and very spoiled.
Although the Maltese likes the comfort of his master’s lap, he also loves a good romp around in the yard. Play lots of games with him and you will have a friend for life. Chew toys and treat-filled puzzles are also a great mental stimulator and will keep him sane for those times when there is no one to play but he needs to let some doggy-steam off.
He would also appreciate a few walks a day, totaling to around 30 minutes outside of his home, for a change of scenery and to meet new canine buddies. It is important to walk any dog no matter how sedentary they are because walking is the best form of mental and physical stimulation for him.
The Maltese does not like to get his silky locks or paws wet, and no matter how much he protests, he needs to be walked, come rain or shine. He is very much a pampered pooch in this respect. There are plenty of great doggy raincoats available, just make sure it is his favorite color!
The Maltese is known to suffer with a condition called a collapsing trachea. For this reason, it is advised that you invest in a sturdy and comfortable harness to attach his leash, too, rather than to his collar. Although he does not pull that much, it is better to be safe than sorry.
The Maltese is a happy-go-lucky pooch who responds best to positive reinforcement training. Although a firm no is needed every now and then, shouting or scolding him will upset the Maltese and make him nervous around you. So, treats, a high squeaky voice, belly rubs, and a ball as a reward is your best bet to train the Maltese. He is a people pleaser so make sure he knows that he is a good boy.
He loves his humans so much that he does not like to be left alone for long periods. It is advised to crate-train any dog who is likely to suffer from separation anxiety, and this is true of the Maltese.
Socialization is important if you want to transform your Maltese pup into the polite Maltese adult that everyone knows and loves. Exposing him to a variety of animals, humans, noises, and experiences will build his confidence, and ensure that he will not be afraid of anything in the future.
Because the Maltese needs daily grooming, it would be wise to familiarize him with this routine as early as possible so that he doesn’t try to avoid it when he is older. Although he is not strong, he can easily wriggle out of yours or his groomer’s hands should he not like being groomed.
The Maltese has a long coat that falls to the floor. His hair is known to grow quite quickly, and you will have to trim it regularly to stop him from tripping over himself. Either invest in a good set of doggy clippers or find yourself a local groomer that you can trust.
A long coat will need daily brushing to remove the dirt and dust that he sweeps up along the way, as well as preventing matting which can be very painful for pups if left too long. If you opt for a shorter teddy cut his hair will need brushing 2 to 3 times a week. Discuss your needs with your groomer, but if he is a show Maltese he will need the full-length coat.
His nails will need clipping regularly because he does not need a great deal of exercise. His nails are often black which can make the clipping process difficult if you are not practiced. If you do not want to clip his nails yourself your groomer can also do this or show you how to.
His small and compact mouth will need brushing at least twice a week with a specially designed doggy toothpaste. His crowded teeth will be a haven for plaque and bacteria, and to prevent periodontal diseases he will need his teeth brushed regularly from a very early age.
The Maltese is a relatively healthy dog breed who enjoys a lifespan of 12 to 15 years. There are a few health concerns that the Maltese breed is prone to, so be sure to research his known conditions and make yourself aware of the symptoms.
Minor Conditions

 Periodontal diseases
 Deafness

Serious Conditions

 Luxating patella
 Collapsing trachea
 Shaker syndrome



Male vs Female
Male and female Malteses are not greatly different from one another. The male Malteses are often bigger than the females, but only relatively so.
If you do not wish to spay the female Maltese you should consider her heat phases. You will need to separate her from the other dogs in the house and walk her separately. Typical dog-walking times will also be difficult because all the local males’ will come over to say hello, and so you will probably need to walk her extra early or late. Unless of course, you are planning to breed her then this does not apply.


3 Little-Known Facts About the Maltese
1. They date back to 3500 B.C.
The Maltese is one of the oldest dog breeds in the world. Although it is thought that they originate from Malta, which is why they are called the Maltese, there is also a theory that they are from Italy, Turkey, or Syria. Their origins are not certain, but royalty and emperors alike gave them as gifts, meaning they quickly traveled the world.

2. The Egyptians believed that the Maltese had mystical powers.
Although this is probably not true (but weirder things have happened) the Egyptians built tombs for their Malteses because it was believed that they had mystical healing powers.

3. Trouble was the richest Maltese in history.
In 2012 a famous celebrity called Leona Hemsley died and left her Maltese dog, called Trouble, $12 million in her will. Despite the judge whittling this final amount down to only $2 million, Trouble lived the rest of her days care, and trouble, free.

Final Thoughts
The Maltese is a proud purebred dog who has been loved for thousands of years, and by now you should understand exactly why he is so popular and adored. He is an adorable toy dog without the intense diva attitude, most of the time.
Not only is he a caring and loving pooch, but he is also calm when you need him to be and playful when you want more energy in your life. He is versatile and adaptable, the only thing you need to consider is his intense grooming regime and that he should not be placed with young children.

These little white dogs hail from Malta where they were highly prized for their charming looks and independent natures. Over the years they have found their way into the hearts and homes of many people other than in their native Malta and for good reason. The Maltese is a charming character and one that is extremely loyal and affectionate. Despite their small stature the Maltese is a larger than life character that’s a real pleasure to share a home with.
The Maltese is thought to be among the most ancient breeds on the planet with records of them dating back 8000 years with poets and artists in pre-Christian times having made a reference to the Maltese in their works. What is thought to be a child's toy of a Maltese was found that dates back eight thousand years and Charles Darwin having estimated the breed to date back to 6000 BC.
When it comes to how the breed came to be known as the "Maltese" there is a lot of debate as to how this came about among scholars and breed enthusiasts alike. There are records of a town in Sicily known as Melita that existed in AD 25 from which many little dogs called Canes Melitei were exported. The Greeks and Romans referred to the Island of Melita as being "Malta" and they found Melitei Dogs there too. As such the ancient Greeks and Romans thought the dog originated on the Island of Malta but there is no real evidence to prove this is true. There is however some evidence that a Roman Governor in Malta named Publius owned a Maltese and that Emperor Claudius brought the first ever Maltese to the British shores.
However there are those who believe the breed is a descendant of a Spitz-type dog that was bred by people who lived in Central Europe. Because Malta boasts a central trading location the breed found their way to other parts of the world including as far afield as China and South-East Asia where they were sold to nobles and royals by traders arriving by sea in their lands.
By the mid-1800s and early 1900s breeders here in the UK thought the Maltese should belong to the Terrier group all thanks to their fearless and courageous natures. This together with the fact the Maltese was a highly skilled ratter reminded many of a terrier-type dog. However not everyone agreed and so the Maltese was simply referred to as a "Maltese Dog" from there onwards.
Between 1859 and 1873 there were twenty-four Maltese dogs registered in The Kennel Club stud book. It was a time when Lady Giffard who was a huge fan of the breed promoted these pure white dogs that boasted such silky coats and kind natures to other interested parties. Maltese dogs can be seen in many paintings and this includes of royalty with Queen Elizabeth I as well as Queen Victoria having been painted with their loyal white companions. They were painted by illustrious masters like Goya and Joshua Reynolds and it is thought Mary Queen of Scots owned one of these charming little dogs too.
The Duchess of Kent commissioned Sir Edwin Landseer to paint her little dog called "Quiz" and then commissioned the artist to paint another of her Maltese dogs called Lambkin. Over the years these lovely looking little white dogs have become a firm and popular favourite with many people not only here in the UK but elsewhere in the world too.
Height at withers: Males 20 - 25 cm Females 20 - 22 cm
Average weight: Males 1.4 - 3.6 kg Females 1.0 – 3.0 kg
Maltese Dogs boast a superb pure white coat with some dogs having a lemon or orange tinge in them. Their hair is long and luxurious which means they are quite high maintenance in the grooming department. They don't have an undercoat so they don’t shed as much as many other breeds making them a good choice for people who suffer from allergies although it is more the dander than hair that causes the allergy problem.
The Maltese has a reasonably long coat but the length does not interfere with their movement. Their coats are silky to the touch and perfectly straight without being woolly or crimped looking whatsoever and they don't have an undercoat. When it comes to colour as previously mentioned these little dogs boast having pure white coats with some dogs having a little lemon or orange tinge in them which is perfectly acceptable as a breed standard.
When a Maltese moves they do so with a straight and free-moving action and where seen from behind their legs should not be too far apart or too close together either.
The Kennel Club frowns on any exaggerations or departures from their breed standard and any fault would be judged on how badly it affects a dog's health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform.
Male Maltese should have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums and it is worth noting that a Maltese can be a little bigger or smaller and they can be slightly lighter or heavier than stated in their breed standard which is to be used only as a guide.
The Maltese is often mistakenly referred to as being a terrier which they are not and therefore they do not have a "terrier" mentality. With this said they might seem delicate and fragile with their long flowing coats and topknots but in truth the Maltese is a determined and robust little dog by nature. They are fearless and never too afraid to show their feelings and being so intelligent the Maltese quickly learns how to please their owners and families.
Maltese as previously mentioned are very alert and intelligent characters and they boast having sweet fun-loving natures. They are lively and yet affectionate and because they thrive on getting as much attention from people as possible they hate being left on their own for any length of time. Even as a Maltese gets older their energy levels remain high which means these little dogs remain lively and playful right through to their golden years. They are quite independent spirits too which is yet another reason why the Maltese has consistently been a popular choice as a family pet and companion dog here in the UK and throughout the world.
These little dogs crave human company and they really do not like to be left on their own even for shorter lengths of time. They suffer from separation anxiety which can result in dogs developing unwanted behavioural problems including howling barking chewing on furniture and scratching at doors and floors. They are the ideal choice for people who work from home or who spend a lot of time in the house but the Maltese is not a good choice for people who are rarely at home because it would make for a very unhappy dog.
The Maltese is a great first-time dog because they are so biddable by nature and therefore easy to train. With this said they can be a little harder to house train than other breeds of a similar size but with patience perseverance and gentleness a Maltese can be taught to do their "business" outside.
The Maltese is a social character by nature and they get on with other animals they meet which includes other pets in a household. They don’t like straying from their owners which generally means they are less likely to take off after an animal they may have spotted in the distance.
The Maltese remains very puppy-like in their behaviour well into their senior years and being so intelligent they quickly learn what pleases an owner. They are playful dogs by nature without being overly demanding although they hate being left on their own for any length of time.
The Maltese is a very versatile and adaptable little dog being just as happy living in an apartment in town as they are living in the country providing they are given enough attention mental stimulation and daily exercise.
Unfortunately the Maltese is known to like the sound of their own voices a little too much. As such it's essential that owners gently curb their pet's desire to bark when puppies are still young but this needs to be done carefully so as not to frighten them which could end up with them barking even more. It's also important to understand that the Maltese thrives on being around people and will bark incessantly if they find themselves on their own for long periods of time. In short a Maltese would bark to get attention and to let the world know how unhappy they are at being left alone.
Maltese are not that fond of water and are not particularly good swimmers which could have a lot to do with the length of their coats which drag them down. Anyone who shares a home with a dog that's not keen on swimming should never force their pet into the water because it would really frighten them when they are already stressed out by things.
The Maltese is a very social dog by nature but they are always quick to let an owner know when there are strangers about or when something they don't like is happening in their environment. However thanks to their small size they are not the best choice for anyone who is hoping to share a home with a more impressive looking watchdog although it would be fair to say that a Maltese would always have their owner’s back regardless of their small size.
Maltese are intelligent little dogs and they adore being around people which when all added up means they are very trainable. The problem is that because they are so cute and smart they like to test the limits and boundaries to see how much they can get away with which can lead to a dog becoming unruly and wilful therefore harder to handle and manage.
Their training needs to start early and Maltese puppies have to be well socialised from a young age for them to be truly well-rounded dogs. The key to successfully training a Maltese is to always be consistent and to set boundaries and to always handle these clever little dogs with a firm yet gentle hand. It is also worth noting that some Maltese are harder to housetrain than other breeds but as previously touched upon with understanding care and patience they can be taught not to mess in the house and to do their "business" outside.
A Maltese puppy should be taught ground rules and limits right from the word go with the first commands being as follows:
Maltese Dogs can be "snappy" around smaller children and toddlers which means any interaction between dogs and the kids must always be well supervised by an adult. As such they are better suited to households with older children who know how to behave and treat a smaller dog.
When it comes to other dogs and pets the Maltese is known to be good around them more especially if they are well socialised from a young enough age which involves introducing them to lots of new situations where they meet other dogs and animals. Any introductions to new pets and children must be done carefully so that things remain nice and calm so that nobody including a dog gets a scare. It’s best not to leave a Maltese alone with any small pets even if they have grown up together.
The average life expectancy of a Maltese is between 12 to 15 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality well balanced diet to suit their ages.
Maltese are known to be healthy little dogs and unlike many other pure breeds they don't seem to be affected by common illnesses that plague other dogs. However any health issues reported to the Breeders Association were minor and therefore do not merit a lot of concern.
They do however seem to suffer from a condition known as "reverse sneezing" which sounds a lot worse than it is. Dogs appear to be choking but they recover quickly so there is usually no cause to worry or seek veterinary treatment when a Maltese has a bout of reverse sneezing. Another hereditary health issue that affects some Maltese is the following condition:
Breeds with shorter noses also have longer palates and when they get excited they do something called "reverse sneezing" which can be a little worrying although it is never a life-threatening condition. The causes can be various but usually it happens when debris or air is trapped under the palate causing irritation which in turn can affect a way a Maltese breathes
Maltese puppies would have had their first vaccinations before being sold but it's essential for them to have their follow-up jabs at the right time with the vaccination schedule being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a Maltese should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A male Maltese can safely be neutered when they are 6 months old and females can be spayed when they are 6 months old too.
Some Maltese gain weight after they have been neutered or spayed and it's important to keep a close eye on their calorie intake and the amount of daily exercise they get to prevent obesity. An obese Maltese would be put at risk of developing certain health issues which could end up shortening their lives by several years.
Maltese are prone to suffering from allergies which can be triggered by several things and when a dog develops a problem it’s best to have them examined by a vet to establish what is causing the flare up. The most common causes of a dog developing an allergy typically includes the following:
Currently there are not BVA/KC health schemes available for the Maltese but all potential owners should discuss any health issues the breed is known to suffer from with breeders before purchasing a puppy from them. However all responsible breeders should have the dogs tested for the following:
There are no breed specific breeding restrictions under the Kennel Club rules for the Maltese at the present time.
Currently there are no Kennel Club Assured Breeder requirements in place for the Maltese**.**
As with any other breed a Maltese needs to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in tip-top condition bearing in mind that these little dogs have 3 coats types during their lifetimes namely a puppy coat which they keep right up until they are around 12 months old a young adult coat and then finally their mature coats. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this they need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
It's important to have things ready for when a puppy arrives in their new home. This involves puppy-proofing the house and garden so it is safe for them to be in without any risk of them injuring themselves. This means making sure a puppy cannot chew on any electric wires and to remove any toxic plants from both the home and the garden. It's also a good idea to limit the amount of space a puppy can roam around in and a good way of doing this is to invest in some child gates to fit on specific doors. Another good way of limiting how far a puppy can roam is to buy a well-made playpen for them to safely romp around in without getting under anyone’s feet.
It is never a good idea to leave a Maltese puppy alone when they are in the garden because they can injure themselves on many things and being so inquisitive by nature they are likely to get into all sorts of things and have a taste at a lot of things they shouldn't too which includes any rubbish that's been left lying around.
Puppies need a lot of rest in between bouts of boisterous play so it's essential they have a quiet area to retreat to when they want to nap. Puppies can sleep anything up to 21 hours a day which they need to preserve their energy so they can grow and develop as they should. With this said their "quiet" area should not be too out of the way because it's important to keep a close eye and ear on a puppy just in case they get into any sort of trouble and need rescuing. Puppies being so small can easily catch a chill so it's important they are kept warm when they are sleeping.
A Maltese puppy would have been wormed before being sold and the documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are items needed to care for a puppy which should be purchased well in advance of their arrival. The items needed include the following:
All puppies are very sensitive to loud noises so it is important to keep the volume of a television down and not to play music too loudly either because it could frighten a Maltese puppy and prevent them from napping as they should during the day.
Reputable breeders would always ensure their puppies vaccinated before they are sold but as previously mentioned it is up to their new owners to make sure they are given their follow-up shots at the right time which should be as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be fully up to date.
When Maltese reach their golden years they slow down in many ways and they might start showing their age with more grey hairs appearing on their faces and more especially around their muzzles. Apart from a change in their appearance a Maltese personality might change too and this includes on how quick they are to respond to a command or when their names are called. The reason for this is that many older dog's hearing is not as good as it once was. Other changes to watch out for in a Maltese when they reach their senior years include the following:
Maltese Dogs shed little hair which means they are easy maintenance when it comes to grooming and keeping their coats looking smart. However it does pay to take them along to be professionally groomed from time to time. They do also tend to get tear stains under their eyes which are more noticeable due to their white coats and although unsightly this does not pose any sort of health issue. Cleaning tear stains can be done using a clean damp cloth being careful not to hurt a dog's eyes in the process.
Many white coated dogs also develop urine stains which are not only unsightly but if not regularly cleaned can become smelly too. As such it's important to gently clean any areas on a dog's coat that's starting to look dirty and if a dog's rear end and legs are very stained to bath them using a dog specific shampoo and to make sure they are thoroughly rinsed off and dried afterwards.
Having the right grooming tools helps keep their coat and skin in top condition. The tools needed to keep a dog's coat looking good are as follows:
These dogs may be small in stature but they are lively energetic characters and therefore need to be given the right amount of daily exercise and mental stimulation for them to be truly happy well-balanced characters. It’s important for these little dogs to burn off any excess calories otherwise they may put on too much weight which can negatively impact their overall health and well-being.
If you have decided to get a puppy from a breeder they would provide you with a feeding schedule and it's important to stick to it for the first few weeks after bringing a puppy home. You can change their diet when the time is right but this needs to be done very gradually and carefully over a few weeks to make sure puppies don't suffer any tummy upsets. Puppies do a lot of growing during the first couple of years of their lives which in short means it's crucial for them to be fed a high-quality diet when they are young.
Older dogs are not known to be fussy or finicky eaters but this does not mean you can feed them a lower quality diet. It's best to feed a mature Maltese Dog twice a day once in the morning and then again in the evening making sure it's good quality food that meets all their nutritional requirements. It's also important that dogs be given the right amount of exercise so they burn off any excess calories which is important or they might start to gain too much weight.
Once a puppy is settled into their new homes it is safe to change their diets but as previously touched upon it needs to be done gradually and carefully to avoid any tummy upsets. As a rough guide Maltese puppies can be fed the following amounts every day to ensure they are getting all the nutrients they need to grow and develop properly:
Once a Maltese puppy is 11 months old they can be fed adult food
As a rough guide an adult fully grown Maltese can be fed the following amounts every day to ensure they stay fit and healthy:
If you are looking to buy a Maltese you would need to pay anything from £600 to over £2000 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year-old Maltese in northern England would be £20.27 a month for basic cover but for a lifetime policy this would set you back £41.22 a month (quote as of March 2016). When insurance companies calculate pet insurance they factor in a few things and this includes where you live in the UK and a dog's age and whether a dog has been neutered or spayed.
When it comes to food costs you need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry to feed your dog throughout their lives making sure it suits the different stages of their lives. This would set you back between £30 - £40 a month. On top of this you would need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Maltese and this includes their initial vaccinations their annual boosters the cost of neutering or spaying your dog when the time is right and then their annual health check visits all of which could quickly add up to over a £800 a year.
As a rough guide the average cost to keep and care for a Maltese would be between £60 to £100 a month depending on the level of insurance cover you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred pedigree Maltese puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
The Maltese is an extremely popular breed both in the UK and elsewhere in the world which means that well-bred puppies command a lot of money. As such with the Maltese there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:
--------------------------------------------------
The Maltese is a small, white, hypoallergenic companion breed from the Mediterranean island of Malta. They are playful and affectionate and have been prized for centuries. Although they’re full of energy, the Maltese requires only occasional exercise to keep them healthy and happy. A short walk or playtime in the yard usually satisfies their needs. They are not high-maintenance dogs, and their long hair must only be brushed a few times a week.
Regarding temperament, Maltese dogs are very intelligent, gentle, and playful. They also are intelligent and devoted and form strong bonds with their owners. They can learn basic commands quickly because they are eager to please their humans. Additionally, Maltese dogs get along well with children and often do well in household settings where they can always receive attention. As a companion breed, they love to be with their people and do not fare well left alone for long periods of time. This easygoing breed is a great companion for novice pet parents and apartment dwellers.
When considering a Maltese, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you’re searching for Maltese puppies, choosing a reputable breeder is crucial. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Maltese breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

Throughout his long history, the Maltese have been given many names, such as the “Melitae Dog,” “Ye Ancient Dogge of Malta,” the “Roman Ladies Dog,” “The Comforter,” the “Spaniel Gentle,” the “Bichon,” the “Maltese Lion Dog,” and the “Maltese Terrier.” Today, he is known simply as the Maltese.
This elegant toy dog breed is famed for the silky white hair covering their body. Straight and thick, the coat falls all the way to the floor. Many years ago, Maltese came in many colors, but they are nearly always white these days. Because he doesn’t have an undercoat, the Maltese sheds little, and many consider the breed hypoallergenic.
But the Maltese is more than his coat. Completing the picture is a slightly rounded skull, black nose, drop ears, dark, alert eyes, short, straight legs, and a graceful tail. He’s a sweet, intelligent dog who is devoted to his people. And as one of the smallest toy breeds, he’s well suited to apartment or condo living. Wherever he lives, the Maltese are responsive to their environment and are effective watchdogs.
Although they look delicate and aristocratic, Maltese can have a lot of energy. They learn quickly if rewarded for their efforts. Because they have a long history as companion dogs, Maltese require much human attention and suffer from separation anxiety. They can bark and become destructive if left alone for hours each day.
No breed is perfect, and Maltese sometimes are intolerant of small children or other dogs, especially if they have been overly pampered by their people. If this occurs, they can become very protective, barking and even biting if animals or people are perceived as threatening their relationship with their beloved human family. However, tolerant Maltese are not a good choice for families with small children because they are so small and can be easily injured. Like all dogs, they must be taught their place in your home, and proper socialization and basic obedience training is required.
Small and easy to care for. Maltese are small dogs, typically weighing between 4 and 7 pounds. This makes them a good choice for people who live in apartments or small homes. They are also relatively low-maintenance dogs, requiring only a few weekly brushings.
Affectionate and playful. Maltese are known for being affectionate and playful dogs. They love to cuddle and play fetch. They are also good with children and other pets.
Good watchdogs. Although they are small, Maltese can be good watchdogs. They are alert and will bark to warn their owners of strangers.
Grooming needs. Maltese have long, silky hair that needs to be brushed regularly to prevent matting. They also need to be bathed and trimmed regularly.
Health concerns. Maltese are generally healthy dogs, but they are prone to some health problems, such as patellar luxation (a kneecap problem), dental problems, and eye problems.
The Maltese dog is one of the most ancient toy breeds, with a history that can be traced back at least two millennia. Artists, poets, and writers immortalized this small dog in the early great cultures of Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Aristotle even mentioned them. The Greeks erected tombs for their Maltese dogs, while representations of Maltese-like dogs on Egyptian artifacts suggest that ancient culture prized them.
The Egyptians and, centuries later, many Europeans thought that the Maltese had the ability to cure people of disease and would place one on the pillow of an ill person. This inspired one of its names — “The Comforter.” Even before the Christian Era, the breed was widespread in Mediterranean cultures. Despite his prominence in history, the exact origin of the Maltese dog is uncertain. Many believe the breed was developed in the Isle of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea from Spitz- or Spaniel-type dogs.
Others believe he was developed in Italy, and others believe he was originally from Asia and contributed to the development of many smaller Asian dogs. Wherever he came from, the Maltese thrived. By the 15th century, he had found a secure place in the arms and hearts of French aristocrats. During the reign of Henry VIII, Maltese arrived in the British Isles. By the end of the 16th century, the Maltese had become a favorite pet for noble and royal ladies.
The little dog was rumored to be a favorite of Queen Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots, and Queen Victoria. Numerous painters, including Goya and Sir Joshua Reynolds, included what many believe to be these small dogs in their portraits of beautiful women. Although the breed survived the fall of the Roman Empire and the Dark Ages, the Maltese was nearly destroyed in the 17th and 18th centuries when attempts were made to breed him to be the size of a squirrel.
After this nearly disastrous experiment, breeders mixed poodles, miniature spaniels, and East Asian miniature dogs with the breed to save it. The Maltese became so varied that several new breeds were formed. Many think that Maltese are the direct ancestors of the Bichon Frise, Bolognese, and Havanese breeds. English breeders developed the Maltese as we know him now. Many Maltese in the U.S. trace their heritage back to English imports. Maltese were first seen in the U.S. in the late 1800s.
They were entered in the earliest Westminster Kennel Club shows in the 1870s. The number of Maltese dogs registered with the AKC grew very slowly until the 1950s. Since then, the breed has become quite popular. Maltese are one of the most popular breeds among spectators at dog shows and frequently win the Toy Group. They also have an excellent record in the “Best in Show” competition.
The compact Maltese should weigh no more than seven pounds at maturity, with four to six pounds preferred. Males should be eight to ten inches tall at the shoulder, while females should be eight to nine inches tall.
Beware of breeders who offer “teacup” Maltese. A Maltese that weighs less than four pounds at maturity is more prone to genetic disorders and is at a higher health risk in general.
The Maltese is a natural ham with a lively personality. Because he’s so people-oriented, he takes well to training and responds to positive reinforcements such as food rewards, praise, and play. Fearless, Maltese assume that everyone they meet — human or animal — is a friend. Sweet and cute, they’re widely known for always getting their way — even with people who have no intention of spoiling them.
Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who’s beating up his littermates or the one who’s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually, the mother is the one who’s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you’re comfortable with.
Meeting siblings or other parents’ relatives is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, when young, the Maltese needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Maltese puppy grows into a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and taking leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Maltese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Maltese will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed. If you’re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy’s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.
In Maltese, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand’s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal.

Maltese enjoy a regular walk or playing outside. They often remain playful well into old age. Because they are active indoors and don’t require much exercise, keeping them in good shape doesn’t require much effort. As a rule, wait until your Maltese puppy is 8 months old to walk very far with him because his bones are still developing.
Let your puppy play at his own pace in your fenced yard until he is mature, and then take him to your vet for a checkup before embarking upon a regimented exercise program. Maltese are definitely house dogs and don’t tolerate extreme heat or cold well. Many people paper train their Maltese so they don’t have to take them outdoors when the weather is too hot or cold.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals. Measure your Maltese’s food and feed him twice a day instead of leaving food out all the time. You can tell if he’s getting overweight by giving him the hands-on test.
Place your hands on his body, thumbs along the spine and fingers spread out over his sides. If you can feel his ribs, he’s in good condition, but if they’re buried beneath a layer of fat, it’s time to put him on a diet and cut back on the treats you’re giving. Some Maltese have delicate digestive systems and may be picky eaters.
Eating problems can occur if your Maltese has teeth or gum problems. If your Maltese is uncomfortable eating or after eating, take him to the vet for a checkup. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don’t all need the same amount of food.
It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog, and the less of it you’ll need to shake into your dog’s bowl. For more on feeding your Maltese, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The stunning Maltese coat is pure white, silky, and straight, reaching all the way to the ground. Maltese don’t have the undercoat typical to many breeds and don’t shed much. On the downside, Maltese coats mat easily and become dirty. In addition, Maltese are prone to unsightly tear stains on their faces. Gently brush and comb the coat of your Maltese daily, even if he has a sporty short trim. This helps to prevent mats and keep him clean.
Beautiful though they may be, Maltese become dirty easily and usually must be bathed weekly. If your Maltese has long hair and develops mats, try working out the mat gently with your fingers, using a detangler spray or a coat conditioning oil. After you’ve pulled the mat apart as much as you can with your fingers, use the end tooth of the comb to loosen individual hairs. Never try to pull the entire mat out at once with the comb or brush, and make sure all mats are removed before bathing your Maltese, as mats tend to get tighter when wet.
You should check your Maltese ears at least once a week. If they seem sensitive or have a bad odor, take them to the vet for a checkup. Also, Maltese grow a lot of hair in their ears that needs to be removed. Ask your groomer or vet to do this or to show you how to pluck the hair at home. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn’t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems.
They’re too long if you hear them clicking on the floor. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far, you can cause bleeding. Your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you’re not experienced in trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Tear and face staining are big problems for most Maltese owners. You should expect tear staining to begin when your puppy is four to five months old (that’s when their adult teeth are coming in). To prevent or lessen tear- and face-staining of your adult Maltese, follow these steps:
If these measures don’t clear up the tear stains, consult your veterinarian. Your Maltese could have clogged tear ducts, allergies, or other health problems causing excessive tearing. While there are many products on the market to whiten your dog’s hair, be very careful when using them or any home remedies.
Many of them can damage your dog’s hair, and never allow any products or foreign substances to get in your dog’s eyes. Many people put the hair on the top of their Maltese head into a topknot to keep it away from the eyes. If you do this, use coated bands that won’t break the hair. Some people clip their dog’s hair short, on its head, or all over, so grooming is easier.
Brush your Maltese’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better to prevent gum disease and bad breath. If you notice that your Maltese’s cute black nose is turning pink, he might not get enough sunshine. Take him outside on a sunny day, or take him for a car ride if it’s too cold to do that. The type of bowl that he’s eating and drinking from could also cause the pigmentation change. If it’s plastic, pitch it. When a female is in heat, her nose can turn pink also.
Begin accustoming your Maltese to being brushed and examined when he’s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience with praise and rewards, and you’ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he’s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, nose, mouth, eyes, and feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Most Maltese breeders will not sell puppies to families with young children. It’s just too easy for a toddler to injure a tiny Maltese by dropping, stepping, or holding him too tightly. He does much better in a home with quiet older children or adults only who will treat him with the care he needs.
Maltese can get along with other dogs and cats if they are socialized with them at an early age. However, they’re unaware of their tiny size and must be protected from taking on dogs that are ten or twenty times their size.
Maltese are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Maltese in need of adoption and or fostering. If you can’t find a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club, and they can point you toward a Maltese rescue.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems or socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues. The American Maltese Association can help you find a Maltese.

Basepaws analyzes this breed as part of the Bichon Lineage
The Maltese breed is one of the oldest toy dog breeds, with a history that stretches back nearly 3,000 years. Originating from the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, these dogs were adored by aristocracy throughout ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Phoenician Sailors visiting the island of Malta around 1500 B.C. for trade are credited with first discovering the breed. Maltese have been associated with nobility, luxury, and refinement, often depicted in paintings and writings of the period. Their exact ancestry is unknown, but they are considered a progenitor to many of the small white European toy breeds seen today. The breed was brought to England in the early 1300s when ladies of the upper-class also took a liking to this small breed. The first Maltese was not seen in the United States until 1877 at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.
The Maltese can suffer from deafness, dental conditions, shaker syndrome, portacaval shunt, patellar luxation, open fontanelles, entropion, hypothyroidism, hydrocephalus, distichiasis, hypoglycemia, patent ductus arteriosus, chondrodystrophy and intervertebral disc disease (CDDY and IVDD risk) with or without chondrodysplasia (CDPA), and glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa). As for all breeds, genetic screening for hereditary conditions is recommended to assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
The Maltese loves to be spoiled and is the perfect lap dog. Although they are small, the Maltese can also be feisty and rambunctious. They are companion dogs but can be over-coddled. Although small in stature, they can make great watchdogs, as they bark at other dogs and strangers. If the Maltese becomes the pack leader it may lead to unnecessary barking and snapping at strangers, other dogs, or even children. Thus, there must be a firm chain of command to keep this breed from acting out. The breed is not recommended for families with younger children.
The Maltese breed is known for its long, silky, pure white coat. Unlike most breeds, the Maltese has hair, not fur, which continuously grows much like human hair and typically does not shed.The Maltese breed has been recognized by the AKC for over a century, with official recognition dating back to 1888.The Maltese's coat can grow to the floor length, resembling a tiny walking mop when not styled.Ancient Greeks built tombs for their Maltese dogs, and Aristotle referred to the breed as "perfectly proportioned" despite its diminutive size. Roman Aristocrats were said to not be fully dressed without their "Roman Ladies' Dog" peeking out.
