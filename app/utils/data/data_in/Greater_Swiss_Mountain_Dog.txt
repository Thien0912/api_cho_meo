The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, are big, handsome farm dog prized in their native Switzerland for their charming, friendly disposition and their reputation for human companionship and being great family pets.
In this article, we‚Äôre going to look at what this charming family pet has to offer your family.
Greater Swiss Mountain dogs are said to have been descended from Roman dogs left in Switzerland 2000 years ago. These dogs soon crossed with local breeds, creating a distinct branch of breeds bearing a resemblance to the Greater Swiss Mountain dog, including the Bernese Mountain dog.
Some believe they originate from a breed brought to Spain by ancient Greeks which then found their way into the Alps.
They were bred for their guarding and herding abilities, and they were also used to pull carts. They would often be bred with St Bernards to improve their favourable strength and hardiness in this heavy weight-pulling task. They were again employed as working dogs during WWII.
However, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog‚Äôs numbers soon began to dwindle until a man called Franz Schertenlieb gathered enough to set up a breeding program.
In 1910 the Swiss Kennel Club recognized them as a separate breed from the Bernese and named them the Grosse Schweizer Sennehund. And so the Swiss Mountain Dog officially joined the country‚Äôs group of Sennehund breeds.
The Greater Swiss Mountain dog is a large breed dog that shares the same markings and colours as their Bernese dog relatives, only with shorter, lower-maintenance coats.

If you do decide to get a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, ensure your house has the space to cater to its size. It‚Äôs also best if you have a decent garden for this giant breed to romp around in.
The Greater Swiss has a thick coat which is relatively low maintenance and will generally only require a once-weekly brush to remove loose hair. They shed dog hair throughout the year and will start shedding hair more heavily during spring and autumn.
Keep an eye on any wax or debris build-up in their ears too. Ear infections can be painful and are often much more work to cure than they are to prevent.
Greater Swiss Mountain dogs make such good guard dogs as they have next to no ego and will bark only when they think you need to know something.
Whereas other guard dog breeds might be a little talkative, the Greater Swiss is not known to be a ‚Äòbarker‚Äô and will protect you with the gentle energy typical of large breeds of dogs.
The size of this large dog alone should be enough to deter any uninvited guest.
Male and female Swissies will grow to between 60-70kg as an adult dogs. The males can grow a little longer with an average height of 65-72cm while the females grow to between 60-68cm.

With the proper socialization and stimulation, this breed can demonstrate quick progress, especially during one-to-one sessions with its owner.
You may even want to consider a puppy kindergarten class where they will be able to make friends and pick up some healthy, sociable habits.
It‚Äôs important, as with any puppy, to make sure they are properly socialized from a young age so they don‚Äôt pick up any bad habits. Don‚Äôt allow a cute, tiny Swissy puppy to take advantage of you ‚Äì maintain a firm but friendly, loving hand and you will both reap the benefits of a close relationship where your dog lives to make sure they‚Äôre pleasing you.
Swissies are sweet-natured, friendly dogs who thrive on a sense of community and whose attitude makes them perfect family dog.

If they lead a healthy life, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog has a life expectancy of between 8-11 years.
A reputable breeder will give you a feeding plan along with your Greater Swiss puppy which you should stick to in order to avoid any upset stomachs.
Adult dogs will need to be fed twice a day in the morning and evening with high-quality nutritional foods that match all their requirements.
Sennenhund breeds are known to suffer from bloating so it‚Äôs important to stick to the twice-a-day routine and not just one large meal.

Yes, this sweet-natured family dog is a born-pleaser, low on aggression and separation anxiety. They take to training very well and their intelligence makes it easy for them to understand what makes you happy and what makes you angry.
Just ensure you have enough space indoors and outdoors to give this big dog a comfortable space to live in.
Despite being able to form close, loving ties with family members, the Swissy is a confident, self-assured dog who won‚Äôt despair if they‚Äôre left alone for an extended period of time. This means they are well suited to family homes where people are required to be away.
No, the Greater Swiss Mountain dog sheds throughout the year so is not compatible with owners who suffer from allergies.
Despite having long hair, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog doesn‚Äôt require a lot of maintenance and can be handled by its owner.

Strong work ethic and being faithful to a fault are only two of the many incredible qualities found in the wonderful Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. Affectionately called the Swissy by fanciers, this breed is also called the GSMD, Metzgerhund, Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund and the Large Swiss Mountain Dog. No matter which name you prefer, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a wonderful, friendly and loving companion for an active family.

Although he is often confused with the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Swissy is much larger and has a shorter coat. He can go from lounging by the fire to pulling a heavy cart through the snow in no time flat. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog works hard and plays even harder! For more info on the Swissy, please continue reading.

Strong work ethic and being faithful to a fault are only two of the many incredible qualities found in the wonderful Greater Swiss Mountain Dog.


Many people believe that the Swissy was brought to Switzerland hundreds of years ago by Roman conquerors. However, others believe that the breed was developed in Switzerland. Either way, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was used for herding livestock, guarding homes and farms as well as pulling carts filled with fresh vegetables and milk.

It is generally accepted that the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was developed centuries ago. Using this theory, the Swissy is a descendant of dogs that resembled Mastiffs. These Mastiff-like canines made their way to Switzerland with the Roman Legions. In the last half of the 19th Century, the breed was almost non-existent. Fortunately in 1908, a researcher recognized two dogs that were miscategorized in a dog show. Since then the breed has been reestablished.


Because of his large size, the Swissy requires a fair amount of high quality food. Dry food is best as it reduces dental problems such as caries, gum disease and smelly breath. Proper nutrition is essential to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog‚Äôs health so consulting with your veterinarian about the dog‚Äôs diet will ensure that he stays happy and well fed. It is best to feed two smaller meals as opposed to one large meal. This breed is prone to gastric torsion, more commonly called bloat. By splitting the meal, you will be decreasing the chances of your Swissy suffering from bloat.





A large breed, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog can weigh anywhere between 85 and 140 pounds.

The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog loves to work and be of use to his family. His work ethic and drive are second to none in the world of dogs. Although they were utilized for draft work pulling carts, today their skills can be used to pull wagons or sleds. The even temperament of the Swissy makes him a loyal companion. They are very accepting of people and will welcome guests with tail wags and slobbery kisses.

Separation Anxiety is a big problem for Great Swiss Mountain Dogs. They bond so fiercely with their families that they are beside themselves when left alone. That being said, the Swissy should never be expected to stay alone for long periods of time.

Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs bark and they bark loud and long. In the past, these dogs were used as sentinels and they still perform their sentry duties today. He will alert you at the slightest noise because he firmly believes that this is his job. Although he is a great alarm system, he is not a candidate for guard dog work.


The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large breed hence; hip dysplasia is a common problem. Although genetic, a dog‚Äôs environment can help to exacerbate a minor problem into a major one. Slick floors, rough play with an adult dog, too much exercise, jumping onto furniture or falls can cause problems. Other potential issues within the breed are Swissy Lick, Spleen Torsion, Cataracts, Epilepsy and Entropion.


The average lifespan of a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is between 7 and 9 years.


Although Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs require a good bit of exercise, they do not need to run for long periods of time like some other breeds. Several long walks will keep a Swissy happy. He will be even happier if he is allowed to carry a backpack or pull a wagon. The Swissy likes to feel that he is doing a job so incorporating work with fun will make your dog feel needed.

The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog loves to work and be of use to his family.


The American Kennel Club writes: ‚ÄúLarge, sturdy and confident, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (GSMD or ‚ÄúSwissy‚Äù) is a draft and drover breed ‚Äì robust and agile enough to perform farm work in very mountainous regions. As a working dog, Swissies like having a job to do and enjoy participating in hiking, carting, obedience trials, herding, weight pulling, and backpacking with their owners.‚Äù The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was first recognized by the AKC in 1995.


The Swissy has a double coat. There is a thick undercoat and a dense outer coat which should be a little more than an inch long. They are a combination of black, white and rust in color. These markings should be symmetrical. Of course, there should be the Swissy trademark blaze on the face as well as a white tail tip and chest.

This is a moderately shedding breed however; twice annually, the dog will fully shed his thick undercoat. When he is shedding, he will need to be brushed thoroughly daily. Other than shedding time, the Swissy will look good so long as he is brushed twice each week.


Greater Swiss Mountain Dog puppies are cute, cuddly and very strong willed. It is absolutely necessary for the owner to take the puppy to puppy kindergarten classes. This will give him a jump start at learning and increase the bond between puppy and human.

It is important to know that Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are slow to mature. Their terrible teenage years can last long into their second year of life. An owner must be prepared to have 100 pounds or more of bouncing Swissy knocking things down in the house for a good, long time.

Entlebucher Mountain Dog Basics
The Entlebucher Mountain Dog (pronounced Ent&rsquo;-lee-boo-ker) is the smallest, but in no way least significant, member of the family of four Swiss mountain dogs or Sennenhunds. The term Sennenhund originates from the Swiss term Senn, which means herder.
The Entlebucher is a short, powerfully built dog. Its head is well-proportioned to its body and its eyes are small and lively. Like most other herding breeds it has extremely powerful jaws and thick, strong legs that support its sturdy body. It has a distinctive tri-color coat with tan, white and black markings.
A highly intelligent and extremely loving dog, the Entlebucher is also a spirited athlete with specific exercise and training requirements. This makes it a dog unsuitable for most casual dog owners. It can however make a wonderful companion for dog owners willing to put in the time and effort to fulfill its needs.
The Entlebucher Mountain Dog is the smallest, but in no way least significant, member of the family of four Swiss mountain dogs or Sennenhunds.
Origin
The Entlebucher is named after its hometown in the Swiss region of Lucerne. They were first recognized as a distinct breed in 1889 and started to gain attention by breeders and enthusiasts in the early 20th century. The breed&rsquo;s population however, already weak in numbers, faced a steep decline during World War I and the Entlebucher was all but wiped out. With the close of World War I, 16 specimens of Entlebuchers were gathered and bred by one Franz Schertenleib, thus rejuvenating and restoring the breed.

A trip to the vet‚Äôs office is never fun ‚Äì even if it turns out your pet is OK and it was just a scare that got you there in the first place, there‚Äôs still a matter of vet bills to stress over. The high costs of veterinary care are, unfortunately, one of the most commonly cited reasons for surrendering a pet to a shelter, especially in the case of unexpected emergencies that can turn out to be quite expensive and put a real strain on a person‚Äôs budget. Naturally, the severity of the issue often dictates the financial aspect of veterinary care, but did you know that your pet‚Äôs breed can also play a part in how costly their vet bills are?The Forbes Advisor team sifted through three years worth of pet insurance claims data, and actually identified which breeds of dogs and cats had the highest vet bills ‚Äì and it might not be what you expect. When it comes to our canine friends, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog tops the list with an average pet insurance claim of $425, followed by the Rottweiler ($401) and the Dogue de Bordeaux ($395). For the felines, it‚Äôs the Siberian Forest Cat that has the most costly medical care ($457), followed by the Bengal ($404) and Mixed Breed Medium-Haired Cats ($403). When it comes to least expensive medical bills, on the other hand, the winners in the category are, surprisingly, designer dog breeds ‚Äì Australian Labradoodle ($226), Miniature Goldendoodle ($230) and Shichon ($241) were the top three dog breeds with lowest vet bill insurance claims.Another surprising finding from this extensive research is that the average pet insurance claim for cats ($355) is higher than the average pet insurance claim for dogs ($306), which means that feline owners have to be prepared to shell out more money when their four-legged bestie goes to the vet than an average dog parent does. Even so, their research also indicates that dog owners spend an average of $730 a year on their dogs, with the main costs being food, followed by vet bills and vaccinations ‚Äì and an unexpected cost in the form of an emergency vet bill can significantly up that amount from average to debt-inducing.In fact, a hefty vet bill amidst the inflation would wreak financial havoc on 63% of surveyed pet owners, with 28% of pet owners saying a vet bill of $499 or less would cause them to go into debt, while a bill of $999 or less would force 42% to borrow money to be able to finance their pet‚Äôs medical care.All things considered, it doesn‚Äôt surprise that pet insurance came up in the report as a wise investment ‚Äì the team found that pet insurance for a dog costs an average of $35 a month, and when compared to emergency vet bills that can cost a couple of thousands, it‚Äôs clear that having your pet insured can majorly save your bank account in a time of need. Still, pet insurance rates and policies vary, and it‚Äôs important to do your research before opting for one ‚Äì to make sure you‚Äôre really getting the best bang for your buck.&nbsp;
Appenzeller Sennenhunde Basics
Also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog and Appenzell Cattle Dog, the Appenzeller Sennenhunde is the rarest of the four ancient Swiss mountain dog breeds. The breed gets its name from the Swiss herders known as the Senn and Appenzell region of the Swiss Alps to which this breed is native.
Like its cousins the Entlebucher, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Appenzeller is a well-muscled and powerfully built dog. Although a medium-sized dog, it is extremely strong and is capable of pulling small carts and trolleys and working as an all-purpose farm dog. Appenzeller&rsquo;s have a thick double-coat that is black, brown and white in color and its ears are high set and floppy.
Appenzellers are an extremely hard working breed and require a great deal of physical and mental exercise to remain happy and healthy. Although an excellent herder and guarder of livestock, their high maintenance and high exercise requirements have not made them overly popular in the United States.
Also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog and Appenzell Cattle Dog, the Appenzeller Sennenhunde is the rarest of the four ancient Swiss mountain dog breeds.
Origin
The Appenzeller Sennenhunde is an ancient breed and has been used in Switzerland for droving, guarding and general farm work for thousands of years. The breed was recognized as a native Swiss breed requiring conservation in 1897 and the first breed club was formed in 1906 by Dr. Albert Heim. These dogs were first introduced to the U.S in the early 1950s.

Is that a laugh? And is he really enjoying this type of playtime?
(photo credit: In Green / shutterstock.com)Short road trips and weekend camp-outs just wouldn‚Äôt be the same without our best buddy riding shotgun, right? But when that Ziploc baggy full of kibble you hastily prepared and the handful of his favorite treats (BTW, not enough!) you stashed away has you rationing his meals and sharing some of yours, it‚Äôs time to think ahead and pack smarter. And there‚Äôs no better way of preparing your pet for a great adventure that won‚Äôt leave him feeling hangry, than by having the right gear at your fingertips. Yes, we‚Äôre talking about the type of gear that will ensure he enjoys full portions of his favorite meals and plenty of snacks, regardless of where your travels take you.
The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in a dog‚Äôs overall health, regulating metabolism, energy levels, and many bodily functions. Just like humans, dogs can experience thyroid issues, which can lead to noticeable changes in their behavior, weight, and coat condition. Understanding these conditions can help pet owners recognize the signs early and seek proper veterinary care.What Is the Thyroid and What Does It Do?The thyroid is a small gland located in a dog‚Äôs neck, responsible for producing hormones that regulate metabolism. These hormones - primarily thyroxine (T4) - help control how the body uses energy. When the thyroid isn‚Äôt functioning correctly, it can lead to either an underactive or overactive thyroid, both of which impact a dog‚Äôs overall well-being.Hypothyroidism: The Most Common Thyroid Issue in DogsHypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland doesn‚Äôt produce enough hormones, slowing down metabolism. This condition is more common in middle-aged and older dogs, particularly in medium to large breeds such as  Golden Retrievers,  Dobermans, and  Labrador Retrievers.Symptoms of HypothyroidismA dog with an underactive thyroid may exhibit signs such as:Unexplained weight gain despite no change in dietLethargy or low energy levels Dry, flaky skin and a dull coatHair loss, particularly on the tail or backCold intolerance (seeking warmth more than usual)Slow heart rateRecurring skin infectionsBecause these symptoms can develop gradually, many pet owners may not notice the changes right away. However, if your dog starts showing multiple signs, it‚Äôs best to consult a veterinarian for a thyroid function test.Causes and Treatment of HypothyroidismThe most common cause of hypothyroidism in dogs is an autoimmune disorder called lymphocytic thyroiditis, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland. Other causes include thyroid atrophy or, in rare cases, iodine deficiency.Treatment typically involves daily thyroid hormone replacement medication, which helps restore normal hormone levels. Most dogs respond well to this treatment, regaining their energy and maintaining a healthy weight with proper dosage and regular monitoring.Hyperthyroidism: A Rare but Serious ConditionHyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid, is much less common in dogs than hypothyroidism. It typically occurs due to a thyroid tumor that causes excess hormone production.Symptoms of HyperthyroidismDogs with hyperthyroidism may show:Rapid weight loss despite a good appetiteIncreased heart rateHyperactivity or restlessness Excessive thirst and urinationEnlarged thyroid gland (noticeable lump in the neck)Since hyperthyroidism is usually linked to tumors, treatment options may include surgery, radiation, or medication to manage hormone production. Early detection is key to improving a dog‚Äôs prognosis.When to See a VeterinarianIf your dog exhibits any signs of thyroid issues, a veterinarian can perform blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels. Catching thyroid problems early can prevent complications and improve your dog‚Äôs quality of life.Keeping Your Dog‚Äôs Thyroid HealthyWhile some thyroid conditions are genetic or unavoidable, keeping your dog at a healthy weight, providing balanced nutrition, and scheduling regular vet checkups can help monitor and maintain their overall health. Being aware of potential thyroid issues ensures your furry friend stays happy, active, and thriving.
We‚Äôve all been there ‚Äì the whirlwind of paws, barks, and boundless energy. Having a dog in your life is an excellent source of joy and companionship, but it can sometimes feel overwhelming. While some may tell you that you need to let your dog be a dog and get over it, the truth is that too much of anything can be bad ‚Äì including excitement.Whether you‚Äôre concerned about your dog‚Äôs excitement escalating into barrier frustration and reactivity or worried that their desire to jump up and greet you each time you come home could lead to them slipping past and running out onto the road, over-excitement can definitely create less than ideal and even dangerous situations.Your dedication to your dog‚Äôs well-being has you searching for solutions. I see you. After all, calm dogs experience less stress, which can help improve their physical and mental health.So, what are you waiting for? I have put together this comprehensive guide to calming techniques with options for dogs of all ages, breeds, personalities, and situations. Find the solutions that suit your dog and start working towards helping your dog find their inner peace today.Understanding Dog ExcitementThe first step in helping your dog discover a calmer outlook on life is understanding the root causes of their behavior. This includes recognizing the common triggers that ignite a dog‚Äôs excitement, differentiating between healthy playfulness and problematic hyperactivity, and learning how breed and age can influence their energy levels. By understanding these factors, you can select calming techniques better suited to your dog‚Äôs specific needs.Common Triggers of Excitement in DogsWhat sets your dog‚Äôs tail wagging and paws tapping? Like humans, dogs have their own personal preferences, and that includes the things that make them excited. However, some common factors are regularly shared by the greater canine population, such as:The thrill of visitors arriving (or you returning home)Anticipation of walks and outingsExcitement surrounding mealtimesThese triggers can also be specific to a particular sense. For example, a dog who is excited by noises may start to freak out at the sound of a doorbell ringing or sirens wailing. Others may feel that excitement beginning to build at the very sight of a dog in the distance or the scent of their favorite human food cooking.Some dogs are even triggered by changes in their daily routine. Seeing you picking up your keys to leave the house on a Sunday when you usually stay home signals that something is different, and that can bring with it a lot of big emotions.Recognizing these triggers is the first step toward creating a calmer environment. Consider keeping a journal, recording any details you notice when your dog gets overly excited, including where you were, what sounds you heard, what your dog was doing, what you were doing, etc. After recording for a while, step back and read through your entries. Do you see any patterns?Healthy Playfulness Vs. Problematic Over-ExcitementNot all excitement is created equal. Playfulness is a sign of a healthy dog, from young pups right up to the slower but still joyful play of a sweet senior. A happy, energetic dog might bounce and wag its tail, even grabbing at their favorite toys to get you to play. However, a dog experiencing anxiety-driven hyperactivity will exhibit signs like excessive panting, an inability to focus, and even destructive behavior (like chewing or digging). This type of over-excitement is often rooted in stress. Left unchecked, this stress can continue to build up, leading to long-term behavioral issues. Learning to read your dog‚Äôs body language will help you identify if your dog‚Äôs excitement is a sign of trouble and respond accordingly. The Role of Breed and Age Your dog‚Äôs breed and age (life stage) can play a significant role in your dog‚Äôs energy levels and their ability to self-regulate. Certain breeds are naturally more energetic than others, bred to perform tasks that require high levels of stamina and drive. While your dog may be living as a pet dog, that natural drive and instinct don‚Äôt disappear. This is the reason why professionals stress the importance of researching breeds before bringing a dog into your life. Some high-energy dogs that are likely going to show higher levels of excitement include:  Australian Cattle Dogs  Border Collie  Australian Shepherd  Jack Russell Terrier  Siberian Husky Belgian Malinois Age also has an impact on a dog‚Äôs behavior and activity. Puppies are known for having boundless energy, and their developing brains often struggle with self-control and self-regulation. ¬†Adult dogs, while generally more mature, may still display high levels of excitement depending on their breed and training. Senior dogs are generally entering a calmer stage of their life, but they may experience age-related anxieties or cognitive decline manifesting in restlessness that could be mistaken for excitement. Understanding what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for your dog in terms of their age and breed will not only help you tailor your calming techniques to their needs but also identify if something is ‚Äúoff.‚Äù Foundational Calming TechniquesFirst, let‚Äôs create a solid foundation for a calmer dog. This involves implementing consistent routines, providing adequate exercise and mental stimulation, using the power of positive reinforcement, and creating a calming environment. These techniques won‚Äôt address any triggers creating anxiety or over-excitement, but they will help to promote a sense of security and reduce overall stress and anxiety levels. Consistent Routine A secret to helping your dog live a calm, relaxed life is providing them the security of a consistent routine. Predictable meal, walk, and playtime schedules let your dog know what to expect, giving structure and reducing anxiety about the unknown. Picture for a moment how you feel when your schedule is thrown off. Your dog experiences similar stress when their routine is disrupted. Establishing and sticking to a consistent schedule can naturally encourage calmness by creating a calm overall environment. Exercise and Mental Enrichment  Physical activity is an essential piece of the puzzle for burning excess energy, but it is only one piece. Mental stimulation is equally important. A tired dog is a good dog, but a mentally exhausted dog is a truly calm dog. While physical exercise tires their bodies, mental exercise tires their brains. A dog that has run for miles may still be mentally alert and restless, whereas a dog that has engaged in a challenging training session will often be calmer and more relaxed. Try incorporating mental enrichment activities like: Training sessions, such as basic obedience or some fun trick trainingIntroduce your dog to scent work (you can pick up a starter kit to help you get started) Try feeding your dog using a snuffle mat, puzzle feeder, or treat dispensing toyChallenge your dog to learn how to use talking buttons Create a DIY busy box using items you have around your home
Feeding your cat is one of the most basic responsibilities as a cat parent, but it‚Äôs more than just opening a can or pouring some kibble into a bowl. Your cat‚Äôs food is the fuel that powers them through their lives with you.Understanding their nutritional needs and establishing an effective feeding schedule is a key consideration for their overall health and well-being. This includes providing the right amount of food at the right time. But there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù solution to mealtime. Instead, you‚Äôll need to figure out how to meet your cat‚Äôs unique needs.In this article, I‚Äôm going to share the most important factors to consider when deciding how often and how much to feed your cat, signs your cat needs a change, and tips for establishing (and sticking to) a feeding schedule that suits both you and your cat.General Feeding Guidelines While there is no universal rule for feeding, there are guidelines that can serve as a starting point for deciding on the best plan for your cat. These are general guidelines based on the average healthy cat. However, they shouldn‚Äôt be taken as set in stone. The general guidelines, as set out by most experts (including VCA Animal Hospitals), are: Kittens 8 weeks ‚Äì 6 months old: Feed approximately 5 meals/day to accommodate their tiny growing stomachsKittens 6 months old and adults: Can be fed larger meals and reduced to as few as 2 meals/day, no longer than 12 hours apartKittens should be transitioned to adult cat food at approximately 8-10 months old Of course, you will need to adjust your cat‚Äôs feeding routine based on several factors, ranging from their overall health to your lifestyle. If you‚Äôre unsure what the right approach is for your cat, I recommend speaking with your veterinarian or a pet nutritionist. Factors That Affect How Much to Feed Your Cat I have mentioned the many factors that can impact the right amount and frequency when feeding your cat. These factors cover many aspects of your cat‚Äôs life, including their health, age, lifestyle, and more. Here are the factors I consider when feeding my cats: Age There are stages in a cat‚Äôs life where they will naturally need a higher or lower calorie intake. Kittens, while growing, need the calories necessary to support their growing bodies. However, if you continue to feed that same amount as an adult cat, it can lead to weight gain and possibly obesity ( an ongoing problem in the US). At the same time, as a cat moves into their senior years, their body starts to slow down. At this stage, you need to adjust their nutrition to better suit their changing needs. Size/Breed Some cat breeds will naturally grow larger than others, requiring more calories to support their size. The best-known large cat breeds are the Maine Coon and the Norwegian Forest Cat. Of course, their size may be impacted if your cat is a mixed breed. I have a Maine Coon mix who is less than 7 lbs because she wasn‚Äôt blessed with the Maine Coon size.Weight You will need to adjust your cat‚Äôs meal depending on their current weight in relation to what is considered healthy. If your cat is overweight, you may need to cut back on how much or how often they are fed to support their weight loss. On the other hand (or paw) if your cat is underweight, you may need to strategically increase their calorie intake by feeding more each meal or feeding them more frequently. Activity Level Do you have a high-energy cat? Breeds like the Bengal are well-known for their playful and adventurous nature. Trying to fuel a higher-energy cat means that you will need to adjust their diet accordingly. However, if your cat is more laid-back and relaxed, feeding them more than necessary can cause them to gain weight. Health Conditions Anytime someone offers general guidelines for best feeding a pet or meeting their exercise needs, these guidelines are based on an average healthy pet. However, there are many health conditions that could impact your cat‚Äôs dietary needs. Conditions affecting how your cat absorbs nutrients from their diet may require a cat to eat more to meet their basic nutritional needs. Some health issues will also cause your cat to gain weight easier, meaning you need to restrict their diet. Or they may have specific needs related to exactly what you‚Äôre feeding or how much they can eat at any given time. When it comes to health-specific requirements, it‚Äôs best to speak with your cat‚Äôs veterinarian. They are familiar with your cat‚Äôs health history and can make recommendations that are best suited to keep them healthy and happy. Food Type Do you feed you cat wet food or dry food? Some foods are more calorie-dense than others, which can impact how often your cat needs to eat. Wet foods generally have a higher moisture content, making them less-calorie dense. A smaller portion of these foods can make your cat feel full. If your cat eats a diet primarily of kibble, they often need to eat smaller amounts to achieve the same level of calories and nutrition. ¬†Your Schedule Your cat‚Äôs health and well-being should be the primary concern when deciding on their feeding schedule, but I would be lying if I said that your schedule doesn‚Äôt also play into your decision. For example, if you have a hectic work schedule, it may be harder to accommodate multiple smaller meals. There are tools that you can use to help overcome these challenges. Many cat parents use automatic feeders like the Cat Mate C300 Automatic Digital Pet Feeder to offer meals on time, even when they are stuck at the office.
In a heartwarming story of second chances, a non-profit organization in Georgia is transforming the lives of shelter dogs by training them for a new purpose in life. These remarkable pups are breaking the stereotypes of ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù shelter dogs by being trained to serve as police K9s. Co-founders Samantha Walsh and Matt Rook are both passionate dog lovers. Recognizing that incredible dogs were being abandoned by the people who were supposed to love them, many never living out their final days before being euthanized for no fault of their own across the country, they wanted to find a solution. Rook previously served as the police chief in Chattahoochee Hills. During his time there, he faced a tight budget that didn‚Äôt allow him to fund a K9 unit in the area. Many people don‚Äôt realize how pricey it is to incorporate a K9 unit with a police force. A single purebred working dog, bred to serve in a law enforcement capacity, can cost more than $25,000. For many smaller towns and communities, this restricts their ability to incorporate the benefits of a K9 unit protecting their neighborhoods. However, Rook and Walsh had another idea‚Ä¶ Drawing on their experience with law enforcement and working with dogs, they proposed the idea that a healthy rescue dog could be adopted and trained to do the same work at a much lower cost to law enforcement agencies. With this in mind, they created a non-profit arm of their business, Hurricane Creek K9.

But while it's not necessarily an issue to worry about, it can be unsightly (particularly with light-colored dogs or cats) and deserves to be addressed on a regular basis‚Äîin other words, cleaned up.If the discharge is smelly or excessive, you‚Äôll want your vet to weigh in on whether your pet may have an eye infection or be suffering from allergies that require a little more care than a simple wipe-down.Assuming that‚Äôs not the case and its just a matter of working eye maintenance into your pet‚Äôs hygiene regimen, there‚Äôs a wide range of products that are superb at tackling the crust and also removing any staining. What I love most, is that there is something suited to every pet‚Äôs personal preference. Because let‚Äôs face it when it comes to cleaning up your little guy‚Äôs face, it‚Äôs never one size fits all, is it?
A tiny Colorado kitty recently found itself in a precarious predicament, requiring the help of local rescuers and first responders. On Friday, November 15th, in Fort Collins, Colorado, a good Samaritan contacted the Poudre Fire Authority (PFA) about a young kitten who needed assistance. It appeared the kitten had been trying to escape a dumpster through a small opening at the base. Unfortunately, their escape plan didn‚Äôt go according to plan, and the kitty‚Äôs head was caught. Responding to the call, firefighters assessed the situation and quickly learned this was a much more challenging rescue. Unable to safely navigate the kitten‚Äôs head back through the small hole, they recognized that heavy equipment was needed. Of course, as any cat parent can tell you, the sound and vibrations these tools would create while cutting through the dumpster would be terrifying for the trapped victim. ‚ÄúThe strong material of the dumpster and tight fit required extremely precise tools often used in vehicle extractions,‚Äù the PFA explained in a Facebook post following the rescue. They contacted Dr. Amanda Cavanagh, an emergency veterinarian from Colorado State University‚Äôs Veterinary Teaching Hospital. As the head of the hospital‚Äôs urgent care service, she was used to dealing with emergencies ‚Äì but this situation was undoubtedly one-of-a-kind. She gave a sedative to calm the frightened kitten and keep them calm throughout the extraction. She then continued to monitor the kitten‚Äôs health while the PFA got to work. The crews got to work meticulously cutting away pieces of the dumpster until the hole was large enough for the cat to slip through to safety. After the successful rescue, the kitten left with NCO Humane in Loveland, where they would recover and receive any necessary veterinary care before starting the search for a loving forever home. While no further updates are available at this time, you can follow the NCO Humane on Facebook. If you want more details about the kitten and their potential to be adopted, contact NCO Humane. The adoption status of the kitten is unknown, but even if they have already found their forever home, there are many other incredible cats in their care.
Have you ever noticed how your dog seems to know your voice even when they can‚Äôt see you? Do you wonder if they actually know it‚Äôs their human calling or if they just assume it‚Äôs you because you‚Äôre in your shared home? A new study from Hungary suggests that your dog may actually recognize your voice. In fact, they may be able to recognize the voices of each of their family members. The study, published in Animal Behavior, aimed to find out if a dog could distinguish between different voices ‚Äì not only between familiar and unfamiliar voices but also between the voices of different family members. ‚ÄúPrevious studies demonstrated that dogs are sensitive to certain acoustic cues in the human voice, they can recognize the sex of the speaker and distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar voices,‚Äù explained Kinga Suranyi, Ph.D. student at the ELTE Department of Ethology. ‚ÄúWhether dogs are capable of voice-based individual-level recognition of humans had not been demonstrated before this experiment. To do this, they invited 31 dogs to participate, and with each dog, three different family members. One at a time, a pre-recorded speech made by one of the owners was played through the loudspeakers. The three owners sat in a row, not speaking, gesturing, or hinting at which person‚Äôs voice the dog was hearing. The dog was then monitored for any signs of recognition. Each dog went through this test 18 times. The results were surprising, with the dogs looking to the person whose voice they were hearing more often than not.
A dog‚Äôs gut health plays a vital role in their overall well-being, impacting digestion, immunity, and even behavior. When the digestive system is unbalanced, it can lead to a range of health issues that diminish a dog‚Äôs quality of life. Recognizing the signs of poor gut health allows pet owners to take timely action to ensure their furry companions remain healthy and happy.Digestive Issues: The Most Obvious SignDigestive disturbances are often the first indicators of gut health problems. Common symptoms include:Diarrhea: Frequent loose or watery stools may indicate an imbalance in gut bacteria,  food intolerance, or an infection.Constipation: Difficulty passing stool or producing hard, dry feces can suggest dehydration, lack of  fiber, or gastrointestinal sluggishness.Vomiting: Occasional vomiting may not be concerning, but frequent or persistent vomiting warrants veterinary attention.Excessive Gas: Frequent flatulence, especially with a strong odor, suggests poor digestion or bacterial imbalance.
When winter arrives with its chilly temperatures, shorter days, and snowy conditions, it can disrupt your usual routines, especially if you have a four-legged family member. For dogs and their owners, this season presents quite a few challenges. However, despite the difficulties, keeping your furry friend engaged and active during the colder months is essential for their happiness and health. Here are some practical tips to help you and your dog make the most of winter.Bundle Up for Outdoor AdventuresDaily walks and outdoor play are essential for burning off energy and maintaining your dog‚Äôs fitness. But during winter, you‚Äôll need to prepare for the cold if you want to keep up with your usual activities outside the house. Invest in proper winter gear for your dog, such as:A  warm coat or sweater to keep them comfortable in low temperatures.Booties to protect their paws from snow, ice, and salt.
Have you ever noticed your dog pacing, panting, or hiding during thunderstorms or fireworks? Does your dog panic when a new guest arrives? You‚Äôre not alone! Many dogs experience anxiety, and it can have a significant impact on their well-being. Anxiety has been associated with higher stress levels, behavioral changes, and even physical health issues. Understanding how to ease your pup‚Äôs anxiety is key to providing the best possible quality of life.While there are calming products and supplements you can try, they often serve as a temporary solution to a more long-term problem. Creating a safe space is a proactive approach that can empower your dog to manage their stress and feel secure in their own home.Understanding Your Dog‚Äôs Anxiety Just like people, dogs can experience anxiety, and it can stem from a variety of triggers. Some of the most common culprits include: Loud Noises: fear and anxiety triggered by loud sounds such as thunder, fireworks, or construction Separation Anxiety: ¬†the distress dogs feel when they are left alone Social Anxiety: stress and anxiety triggered by interactions with people (especially strangers) or other animals Travel Anxiety: increased stress often associated with car rides or vet visits While these are the most common causes, your dog‚Äôs anxiety could be caused by just about anything that causes them stress or upset. Even subtle changes in routine or environment and past traumatic experiences can manifest in anxiety. With such a wide range of possible triggers, it‚Äôs easy to see why it‚Äôs so common. Recognizing the symptoms of anxiety is the first step in providing trimly support and much-needed relief. These signs can be physical, behavioral, or a combination of both. You may notice your dog is panting excessively, pacing, trembling, or whining. Many anxious dogs will also hide or seek constant reassurance from their people. Some dogs will even display destructive behavior, like digging and chewing. Subtle cues like lip licking, yawning, and ‚Äúwhale eye‚Äù (showing the whites of their eyes) are also signs of underlying fear and anxiety. Not only is anxiety an uncomfortable situation in the moment, but chronic or prolonged anxiety can lead to a long list of health problems and a diminished quality of life. When dogs experience stress, their bodies release hormones like cortisol, which, over time, can weaken the immune system, upset their sleep patterns, and contribute to gastrointestinal problems. Chronic stress can also worsen existing health issues and negatively impact their overall mental and emotional well-being. This is why it is so important to take steps to address the problem if you suspect your dog is struggling with anxiety. It‚Äôs not just about relieving their immediate discomfort; it‚Äôs about protecting their long-term health and happiness. What is a Safe Space? A safe space for your dog is a designated area or room where they can retreat to feel secure and protected. It‚Äôs their refuge from the stressors of daily life, a place where they can find comfort and calm if they are feeling overwhelmed. Think of it as their personal sanctuary, a place they can go when they need to decompress and feel safe. Think of the average teen or pre-teen child and the importance of their bedroom. When they are feeling angry, upset, or frustrated with anything happening at school or home, that‚Äôs the space they usually run to (often accompanied by slamming the door). This is the equivalent for your pup. Your dog‚Äôs safe space could be a quiet corner of a room, a rarely used room like a guest room, den, or even their crate. One common misconception is that creating a safe space is a form of punishing or isolating your dog. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. This special area shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a punishment. It‚Äôs a positive and comforting retreat. A safe space is a tool to empower your dog to manage their anxiety, not to confine them. In fact, more often than not, their ability to move about the house isn‚Äôt restricted in any way. Instead, it's a place where they can voluntarily seek comfort, a haven where they can feel secure and protected. Of course, to make this feel like a safe place they can turn to, there are a few factors you will need to consider, including the actual setup of the space and the training required to help create a positive association with it. So, let‚Äôs look at those two key elements in more detail‚Ä¶ Creating the Ideal Safe Space To set up the ideal safe space for your dog, you must carefully consider several factors, from location and comfort to gradual introduction and positive reinforcement. The following guidelines will help you provide your pup with a secure and calming getaway. Location, Location, Location When setting up your dog‚Äôs space, location is key. Consider your dog‚Äôs personality and preferences. Some dogs will feel safer in a space that is closer to their person, while others would be happier tucked away somewhere secluded on their own. Ideal spots are often quiet corners, back rooms, or even closets. The goal is to find a naturally secluded area away from your home‚Äôs highest-traffic zones. Your dog may prefer enclosed spaces with a door or flap that cuts them off from the rest of the world. Alternatively, they may feel more comfortable in an open area. Pay attention to your dog‚Äôs natural hiding spots for clues as to what will make them feel most secure. The Right Bed or Crate A comfortable bed or crate should be the central feature of this safe space. Size, material, and placement are all factors to consider. The bed or crate should allow your dog to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably. Consider whether soft, plush materials or a firm, supportive surface best suits your dog‚Äôs preferences. If you‚Äôre using a crate to build out this space, you‚Äôll need to choose between a more open or closed crate design. Open crates offer security while allowing your dog to still see what‚Äôs going on around them. Closed crates create a more secluded spot. If you currently have an open crate but feel your dog would benefit from a closed design, you can easily transform it with a crate cover or even just a blanket draped over the top.

We often hear about musicians and artists making an impact through financial donations or participating in charitable events. But a new heartwarming story of a dog‚Äôs search for his forever home has been capturing the hearts of animal lovers everywhere. Graham Cracker was found by a young girl in the woods of Vilonia, Arkansas, with his mother and littermates. She had been sneaking food to the stray mama dog, trying to do what she could to help. After her mother found out about the dogs, she contacted a rescue team to find them and get the pups to safety. This was when their journey led the pups to The Bond Between, a non-profit rescue organization in Minnesota. But for Graham Cracker, this was just the beginning! On October 17th, an announcement on Instagram revealed that Graham Cracker had found a loving but very unique foster parent. After seeing the young pup‚Äôs adorable photos, Grammy-winner Pink invited the pup, who appears to be a Labrador Retriever mix, to join her and her family on tour. She went on to announce the decision to her fans during her St. Paul, MN show:‚ÄúWe rescued a puppy from this awesome organization called The Bond Between. His name is Graham Cracker. He‚Äôs currently peeing all over my dressing room,‚Äù Pink stated while seated at her piano on stage. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actually ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt told anybody this yet, but we‚Äôre gonna foster him for the tour, and he‚Äôs gonna go on this big carnival adventure with us.‚Äù
