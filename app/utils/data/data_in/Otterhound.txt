Are otterhounds good with cats? If you’re considering adding an Otterhound to your home and already have cats. Assessing the potential dynamics between these two animal species first is essential.
This blog post will discuss guidelines for determining if an Otterhound and feline co-habitation suits you. We will also provide tips on safely introducing them based on their personalities. Finally, we’ll cover information to help ensure both animals remain happy and healthy in their new living arrangement.
Ready? Let’s understand the complexities of matching canine and feline housemates perfectly.
Before we can assess whether otterhounds are good with cats, it’s essential to understand their temperament. So here’s a quick overview of their main traits to help you decide if they are compatible with cats.
The Otterhound dog breed is a friendly and outgoing breed that loves people. They are not shy or aggressive around strangers and often greet new people enthusiastically. They are also good with children, though they can sometimes be too boisterous for young children or those not used to dogs.
The Otterhound is an energetic breed requiring plenty of daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. They are intelligent dog breeds that need mental stimulation and physical activity. Daily walks, agility courses, nose work games, and playtime are great ways to entertain and exercise your Otterhound.
The Otterhound dog breed is an even-tempered breed that rarely shows signs of aggression or fearfulness. They have been bred as hunting dogs for centuries, so they are independent thinkers comfortable working independently or in groups. Their even temperaments make them excellent therapy dogs; many stories of these dog breeds provide comfort to those in need due to their loyal natures and friendly personalities.
The Otterhound dog breed has a long history of being good with cats and tolerating their presence. They may even play together! However, as with any dog breed, it will still be necessary to socialize them with cats early on before expecting them to live harmoniously together. Some factors that could impact otterhounds’ compatibility with cats include:
Otterhounds are highly trainable dogs and can learn basic commands with patience and consistency. Training your hound dogs in simple commands, such as sit, stay, down, etc., is essential so that they understand how to behave around other family pets—especially cats. However, if not adequately trained, otterhounds may still view cats as prey and try to chase them.
As mentioned above, the temperament of an Otterhound dog breed is generally calm and friendly. They are loyal companions who love spending time with their owners and enjoy being around other animals. This breed is not known to be aggressive towards cats but may have playful energy, so it’s essential to keep an eye on them when they are together just in case things get out of hand.
Otterhounds are generally friendly dogs, but if provoked or scared, they can act aggressively toward cats or other animals in the home. Some common signs of aggression include growling, barking, or lunging. Suppose your otterhound has shown any signs of aggression towards cats in the past. In that case, working with a professional trainer ( obedience training ) and behaviorist is essential to help manage this issue.
Otterhounds are naturally territorial, especially regarding their space in the house. It means they don’t like it when other animals—like cats—invade their space. No matter how big or small that space is. It’s essential to be aware of this and ensure that your otterhound has a designated area it can call its own.
Otterhounds are highly social dogs and can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for too long. If your otterhound has any signs of anxiety or distress when you leave the house, it’s important to ensure that cats in the home are not triggering this behavior. In some cases, cats can be the source of anxiety for an otterhound, and it may be necessary to provide them with an area where they can feel secure and calm when left alone.
Size is certainly one aspect to take into account. While some cats may be larger than Otterhounds, it’s often cats specifically bred for size, which would make them better suited for this type of living arrangement.
Cats and dogs should always be in peak condition for successful interspecies interactions. Additionally, Otterhounds have a high prey drive (otter hunting), meaning they have been bred to chase down small animals. This can intimidate cats and make it difficult for them to co-exist peacefully.
Ultimately, an Otterhound can live peacefully with cats if you take the proper steps, which we will discuss below.
Introducing an Otterhound to a cat slowly and carefully is essential to ensure that both animals get along well. Here are five tips for introducing an Otterhound puppy to a cat.
Before you begin the introduction process, your cat and dog should know each other’s scent. This can be done by swapping its bedding or brushing with the same brush, so they become used to smelling one another.
Let your otterhound puppy and cat become comfortable with each other from afar before allowing them together in the same room. Then, allow them both to approach each other when ready, rather than forcing them together too quickly and risking conflict between the two animals.
If your pets are in the same room together, ensure you are there supervising at all times. So that you can intervene if any negative behavior occurs between them. It is crucial during mealtimes since food aggression can be an issue between cats and other dogs –– even if they are getting along otherwise!
Once your pets have been introduced and are comfortable around each other, ensuring that your cat always has a place to go when they feel overwhelmed is essential. Or need some alone time away from their canine companion. Place scratching posts or perches on higher surfaces so your cat can escape if needed while still being able to keep an eye on their canine friend below.
It’s essential to create separate spaces for both animals in the house. So they have an area where they can retreat when needed without feeling threatened by one another’s presence nearby. For example, put up baby gates or use litter boxes as barriers between rooms. To give both animals their own space without having one infringe upon the other’s territory too much.
It helps create positive associations with each other’s presence and encourages bonding over shared rewards instead of fear or aggression. This can be especially helpful for cats that are shy around other dogs.
It helps create routines and bonds between them, making it easier for them to adjust in the long run. Playing with toys that involve both animals, such as tug-of-war ropes or chasing balls together, can be especially effective at helping build trust between them over time.
To alleviate the tension, praise both animals when they show good behavior. For example, if your otterhound shows curiosity but stays relaxed. Praising them with a gentle voice or a treat reinforces that behavior. Similarly, when your cat offers comfort rather than fear around the hound, give them lots of love. Praise is great for building trust between pets and creating a harmonious living situation that you and your animals will be happy about.
By taking the time to introduce your Otterhound and cat, you can ensure that they can live together peacefully.
Though training otterhounds and cats together can be challenging, the benefits of owning an otterhound and a cat in the same household are plentiful.
Having an Otterhound in the house means your cat must stay active to keep up with their furry counterpart. More exercise can help keep your cat fit and healthy while having fun at the same time.
Cats need mental stimulation just as much as dogs, so having an Otterhound buddy can help provide this for your feline friend. In addition, watching their canine companion’s antics will be endlessly entertaining for your kitty.
Among the most important benefits of having an Otterhound and a cat in the same household is they can provide companionship for one another when you are away from home or unable to give them attention. In addition, it can help reduce stress levels for both animals, leading to happier pets overall.
Owning two different kinds of animals provides excellent training opportunities for each pet. For example, cats can learn how to interact with other animals from their canine companion. At the same time, dogs can learn better manners from observing cats’ more refined behavior. It’s a win-win situation.
Having an Otterhound and a cat in the same household means double the unconditional love. And what could be better than that? Both breeds are known for being loyal and affectionate companions who will always be there for you when times get tough, or you need extra cuddles.
Owning an Otterhound and a cat in the same household can be incredibly rewarding for you and your animals.
After following the tips above, you can look for the signs that your Otterhound and cat have successfully bonded. These include:
A sure sign of a significant relationship between an Otterhound and a cat is if they play together. If your cat and pup are chasing each other around the house or batting at toys, they’re happy to be in each other’s company. This is especially true if your cat initiates the playtime – as this shows that your pup has earned their trust.
Mutual respect is a vital sign of a good relationship between an Otterhound and a cat. It is usually seen when both animals remain calm around each other with no aggressive behavior or posturing. The Otterhound should not be overly dominant or try to start a fight with your cat. At the same time, the cat should not become defensive or scared in the dog’s presence. These signs can help you gauge if they will get along well in the long run.
Suppose your furry friends take naps together or curl up near each other during sleep. It is another good indication that they have formed a bond. Even better, if your pet sleeps directly on their companion or licks them occasionally, you know their friendship is strong.
When cats groom themselves, it’s usually seen as affectionate behavior towards themselves. But when cats groom dogs (or vice versa), it’s often seen as a sign of mutual respect between two animals who have grown close to one another. For example, suppose you notice your cat licking or grooming your pup. Then this could indicate just how much they care about each other!
When two animals greet one another upon meeting after some time apart, it speaks volumes about their relationship with one another. For example, suppose your pup wags its tail when it sees its feline friend or vice versa. It means they both have genuine love and affection – which can only be seen as positive.
Finally, when cats and dogs snuggle together on the couch or bed, it indicates that they feel safe—enough to do so without fear of being attacked by the other creature. Likewise, when cats lie down next to dogs without showing any signs of distress or discomfort, such as flattened ears or hissing, you can be sure that these two animals have formed an unbreakable bond.
When choosing a cat breed suitable for living with an Otterhound, it’s important to consider its size and temperament. Here are some of the most popular breeds that work well in households with an Otterhound:
The Maine Coon is known as the gentle giant of the cat world due to their large size and laid-back personality. These cats are loyal and affectionate and enjoy spending time with their owners. They also get along well with other animals, including dogs, making them an ideal choice if you have an Otterhound in your home.
The Abyssinian is an active breed of cat that loves to play and explore its environment. They are intelligent and love interacting with their owners through activities like fetch or hide-and-seek. They also get along well with other animals and make excellent companions for otterhounds.
Siamese cats are known for their striking coloration and vocal nature. They are very social cats that enjoy spending time with their owners, making them perfect companions for otterhounds who need plenty of interaction and attention from their humans. Siamese cats can also be vocal, keeping you entertained throughout the day!
The Sphynx breed is known for its lack of fur due to a genetic mutation that results in hairless skin instead of fur. Despite this unique trait, they still require frequent grooming because their oily skin produces excess sebum oil on their bodies when not groomed regularly. Sphynx cats are outgoing and friendly, getting along well with other pets—including otterhounds—making them ideal companions for those who want a pet that doesn’t require much grooming but still enjoys human interaction!
Ragdolls are known for being laid-back lap cats who love nothing more than snuggling up next to their owners on the couch or bed all day. They get along well with other animals, making them excellent companion cats for those who already own an otterhound or another type of dog. Ragdolls require minimal grooming due to their short fur coats so that they won’t need too much extra care from you!
The Burmese have been known as an intelligent, loyal, and playful breed since their origin in 1930s Burma. This cat is active and loves to play fetch, hide-and-seek, or chase after toys. The Burmese are also very curious and love to explore new places. Because of this inquisitive nature, the Burmese may be attracted to the outdoors and even try to follow their canine counterparts on walks if given a chance.
With a beautiful long coat and gentle demeanor, the Persian makes an excellent addition to any home with a pup like an Otterhound. Persians are docile cats who love nothing more than lounging around in their favorite spot (often near you). They are generally calm but enjoy playing with toys or chasing after strings when bored or excited.
If you are looking for an easygoing companion for your Otterhound, look no further than the Exotic Shorthair! This breed was developed by crossing Persian cats with shorthaired breeds such as American Shorthair or British Shorthairs. It gives them all the same traits as Persians—a sweet temperament and calm personality—but without all the fur maintenance! The Exotic Shorthair loves to cuddle up close with its canine counterparts, making them ideal companions for any pup!
The Birman is among the most popular breeds due to its affectionate demeanor and willingness to share its home with other pets. Birmans love playing games like hide-and-seek or chasing after toys but also enjoy just lounging near their humans while watching TV or working from home. In addition, Birmans have a wonderful sense of humor, making them great companions for dogs like Otterhounds who need entertainment during their downtime.
Don’t let their cute little ears fool you—the Scottish Fold is one active kitty! They love playing games such as chasing after toys or running around with their canine friends; however, they can also be quite laid back when it’s time for cuddles or family time indoors. In addition, Scottish Folds enjoy interactive activities such as puzzle solving, so they can often keep up with an energetic otterhound’s pace while still having fun at home together!
When given a chance, cats and dogs can form strong bonds with one another. If you have a cat and an otterhound in your home, these five cat breeds are great companion animals for your pup.
Any dog can be trained to get along with cats, but some breeds are more naturally disposed to be accepting of felines than others. For example, according to the American kennel club, Greyhounds are one of the most cat-friendly dog breeds. They tend to be gentle and patient, making them a great choice if you want to introduce a pet dog into a home with cats. The same goes for Otterhounds; they tend to be very calm and patient dogs that get along well with other animals.
No, not at all. This rare breed is known for being sweet, gentle, loyal, and devoted to its families. They make great family pets because of these qualities and can even be trusted around small children. Although they may bark when strangers approach their home or yard, they are generally not considered aggressive towards people or other animals.
Yes! This beautiful, large breed, as per the national breed club, make excellent pets for those with the time and energy to give them the necessary exercise and attention. They require plenty of daily activity—at least an hour per day—but if you provide enough exercise and mental stimulation, they will reward you with unconditional love and loyalty in return.
So, are otterhounds good with cats? If properly socialized from a young age and given plenty of positive reinforcement when interacting with the cat. The Otterhound dogs can indeed be compatible companions for feline friends. Follow the tips above to ensure that your cats and otterhounds form a strong bond and have a safe, peaceful home environment. With patience, understanding, and love, your Otterhound can grow up to be the perfect furry companion for any cat! Happy pet parenting!

The cute, fluffy Otterhound is an adorable hound breed from the North West of England that is currently extremely rare around the world. Underneath their large stature and rugged appearance, Otterhounds have a friendly, amiable, and even-tempered disposition that makes them loving companions for owners and their families.

Otterhounds are a large-sized breed that stands evenly, straight and sound in their neutral stance. They exude strength and have a muscular frame, but their distinctively fluffy double coat makes them easily distinguishable.

Their eyes demonstrate intelligence and are deeply set, with colouring around the rims matching or complementing their coat colour. Their ears are unique and a distinguishing feature. They are set long and in a pendulous fashion with a characteristic fold. Their tails taper from thick at the base to thin outwards and are carried straight up with little curvature when alert.

Coat colours vary widely, including whole white coloured, grizzle, red, sandy, wheaten, and blue. Many markings, spots, and colour variations and combinations exist which are permissible.

Otterhounds somewhat resemble Griffon Nivernais and Griffon Vendeen breeds, to which they are related.

How big do Otterhound dogs get?
Height: males 69 cm; females 61 cm
Weight: males 52 kg; females 36 kg

Jovial, amiable, and even-tempered, Otterhounds love to please their owners just as much as they love to be pleased themselves. Aggression is a highly undesirable trait, so most ethically bred Otterhounds will not show signs of aggression at all, making them a safe and ideal companion pet for owners with families, including around young children.

They do tend to have their own unique sense of independence, which can prove frustrating for owners. Otterhounds will happily play with other pets, owners, and their families for long bouts of joyful play sessions, but when they’ve had enough and want to do their own thing, it will be obvious.

On account of these traits, they are wonderful companion pets but make for poor watchdogs or guard dogs.

Are Otterhound dogs affectionate? Yes, very.
Do Otterhound dogs have high or low energy levels? High energy.
Are Otterhound dogs loyal? Yes.
Are Otterhound dogs playful? Yes, very.

Are Otterhound dogs easy to train? Yes.
Are Otterhound dogs good guard dogs? No, they are too friendly to be watchdogs or guard dogs.

It is fairly easy to socialise an Otterhound thanks to their even-tempered disposition and their amiable behaviour. When well-raised and well-socialised, Otterhounds tend to get along just fine with other dogs, small pets such as cats, and other people, including strangers.

On the other hand, their superior intelligence can also lead to developing naughty habits and behaviour if neglected. Although hardly ever aggressive, Otterhounds may bark, pout, or chew on furniture if their personal emotional needs are unmet.

Keep in mind that around watercourses, Otterhounds will pick up a scent easily and thereby engage their prey drive. Walk your Otterhound on a lead in public and allow him to roam off-lead when safe to do so, but keep him well supervised around watercourses or where small animals are running around.

Do Otterhound dogs get along with other pets? Yes.
Do Otterhound dogs get along with other dogs? Yes.
Are Otterhound dogs good with kids? Yes.
Are Otterhound dogs good with strangers? Yes, they are very sociable around strangers.

Otterhounds thrive in homes where there is ample outdoor space to roam around and play, both activities they love to partake in. Consequently, they are not ideal at all for apartment dwelling or in tight urban areas where they will likely feel timid and constrained.

It is far better to adopt or purchase an Otterhome in a home with a large garden, particularly if fenced in, whereby the Otterhound can work off much of his high energy.

As a hound dog bred for otter hunting near low brush and shallow watercourses, Otterhounds are well accustomed to cool temperatures. This is also a reason why they have a rather high prey drive and are prone to chasing.

First-time puppy owners may have some difficulties raising an Otterhound, not only because it is incredibly difficult to find one but also because their strong independent streak can be difficult to manage well unless the owner is experienced with raising puppies.

Are Otterhound dogs good for first-time owners? No.
Are Otterhound dogs hypoallergenic? No.
Are Otterhound dogs prone to drooling? No.
Are Otterhound dogs a good breed for apartment living? Absolutely not.
Do  Otterhound dogs shed a lot? A moderate amount of shedding.
Do  Otterhound dogs bark a lot? No, not much.
Can Otterhound dogs be left alone at home? Yes, for moderate lengths of time.
Can Otterhound dogs handle the heat? Yes, but not too hot.
Can Otterhound dogs handle cold temperatures? Yes.
Are Otterhound dogs sensitive to loud noises? Yes.

Otterhounds have a slightly below average ranking in terms of health when compared to other breeds. Unfortunately, many Otterhounds are prone to bone and joint problems in particular, which can range in severity from pain and discomfort to lameness.

In terms of hereditary diseases and conditions, Otterhounds do not suffer from as many as with other breeds, perhaps due to their small gene pool and low numbers from which insufficient data is available.

Even if your Otterhound appears to be perfectly health, ensure that he is taken to see the veterinarian every so often to diagnose any potential health problems.

Some common problems include:

Bloat: common to many breeds, bloat and sometimes gastric torsion can result from poor feeding habits or overeating, especially as Otterhounds grow into adulthood;
Epilepsy: epileptic seizures are somewhat common amongst Otterhounds, and can prove worrisome and debilitating. It is best to have your Otterhound regularly tested and treated for epilepsy;
Hip dysplasia: common to many large breeds, including Otterhounds, hip dysplasia is the abnormal growth of the hip bones, which can be hereditary and lead to pain and discomfort to the lameness of one or more legs;
Elbow dysplasia: along with hip dysplasia, another bone and joint health problem that Otterhounds are prone to is elbow dysplasia. If your Otterhound has difficulty standing or walking properly (i.e. with a limp) have him brought in for testing.

How long do Otterhound dogs live? - 10-13 years

As an active, outdoor breed, Otterhounds love playing outdoors and require plenty of exercise to match their high energy levels. Anywhere from one hour to an hour and a half every day will be necessary to keep him stimulated both physically and mentally.

Although it is generally safe to take your Otterhand off the lead in safe spaces, keep a close eye on him since he may chase small animals quite far away. This is part of the Otterhound’s natural instinct, and rather than punish them for behaving naturally, engage them with activities that simulate chasing such as throwing a stick or ball.

One particularity of Otterhounds is their adaptation from hunting hounds in low-lying brush and watercourses, which means they’ll naturally love to splash around and swim in the water whilst chasing around ducks or waterfowl.

How much exercise does an Otterhound dog need? - At least 1 hour per day
Do Otterhound dogs like water play? Yes, they are naturally great swimmers.

Otterhounds eat quite a bit, especially in their formative months as puppies. It’s important that owners feed them according to a strict regimen, broken into three to four meals daily.

Feed your Otterhound a rich diet full of healthy proteins, minerals, and vitamins and consider alternative diets such as raw food or cold-pressed rather than hot extrusion dog food (i.e. kibble), but always consult with your veterinarian first to see if it is appropriate for your specific dog.

Note that Otterhounds tend to make a bit of a mess whilst eating. Cleaning their beards frequently is therefore necessary.

Are Otterhound dogs prone to weight gain? Yes, especially as they age.
How much should I feed an Otterhound puppy? About 270-610g per day, in 3-4 sessions.
How much should I feed an adult Otterhound dog? About 340-550g per day, in total.

Despite having a thick coat that may seem difficult to groom, they aren’t exactly the most high-maintenance breed and are instead fairly easy to care for. Their moderate amount of shedding, however, may require more frequent vacuum cleaning around the home.

Emotionally, Otterhounds are not too demanding and can be left alone for moderate lengths of time. Just don’t make this a habit or else they can become bored and possibly destructive.

- Grooming: once a week, brush your Otterhound’s coat of fur and remove any dead hairs, and pay special attention to any twigs, dirt, or soil that can easily get caught in their thick coats. Have their ears and eyes inspected and cleaned out every week to avoid infections.
- Emotional care: Otterhounds can tolerate some separation anxiety, perhaps a few hours during the day. Do not let this become an everyday occurrence.

It remains unknown exactly where the Otterhound draws its origins, but the earliest recorded Otterhound breeds date to the early 19th century. Other breeds, most likely French breeds from Normandy, were crossed in the following decades until the early 20th century when the  Griffon Nivernais was crossed and the current breed of Otterhound remained until this day.

Otter hunting was banned in the UK in 1978, which led to a great decline in the need for Otterhounds. Nevertheless, breeders persistently continued to breed these beautiful dogs and their numbers have stabilised in recent years. They remain relatively unpopular, however.
The Kennel Club has declared Otterhounds to be a Vulnerable Native Breed. Only 600 exist worldwide;
All Otterhounds can be traced back to one common ancestor, a crossbreed of Grand Griffon Vendéen and Bloodhound, named Boatman;
The Otterhound is the most endangered dog breed in all of Britain. Efforts are being made to save this breed.

The Otterhound is a large scenthound breed from England known for exceptional tracking abilities and incredibly rare status as an endangered breed. With only a few hundred registered Otterhounds worldwide, this extremely rare breed was historically developed to assist hunters in pursuing and capturing otters, hence their name. Otterhounds are characterized by their shaggy and waterproof double coat, which protects challenging terrains and water. Their expressive eyes and distinctive nose give them an endearing look. Otterhounds are renowned for their strong sense of smell, a crucial trait for their historical role in tracking otters along riverbanks.
Otterhounds possess an affectionate, friendly, and outgoing temperament. While they make excellent family companions, their intelligence and independent thinking can sometimes lead to a stubborn streak. Consistent training and positive reinforcement are essential! Regular exercise is also crucial for an Otterhound’s well-being. Although Otterhounds are not as common as some other breeds, their unique charm, combined with their history and versatility, makes them a treasured choice for those who appreciate distinctive and capable canine companions.
When considering an Otterhound, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you decide to purchase an Otterhound puppy, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Otterhound breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

Would life with a large, boisterous, shaggy dog be perfect? If so, the Otterhound might be the dog for you. The Otterhound is an old breed developed in England from Bloodhounds and other types of dogs. Although the Otterhound is believed to have existed for more than 500 years, it’s a fairly rare breed today. There are currently fewer than 1,000 Otterhounds, only 350 to 500 of them residing in the United States. Four to seven litters are born yearly in the United States and Canada. If your heart is set on an Otterhound, expect difficulty finding one. Why is the breed so uncommon? No one knows for sure, but it certainly isn’t because of the Otterhound personality. Sometimes called the “class clown,” the Otterhound has a sweet, affectionate, fun-loving personality. He’s independent, too, not demanding a lot of attention. After greeting you with enthusiasm, the Otterhound is likely to finish the nap he was taking when you arrived. The Otterhound is a large breed. Even small females weigh about 65 pounds, and large males can weigh 125 pounds. They’re definitely dogs who take up space in the household.
Otterhounds are great with kids, but because of their large size and bouncy personality, they may be too rowdy for very young or small children. They can also be too boisterous for frail seniors. The Otterhound has a distinctively shaggy look. His head appears to be very large and long; and his ears are long and folded, giving them a draped appearance. He’s physically strong, with a long, striding gait. He has the extremely sensitive nose of a hound, and it’s likely to lead him off to investigate his surroundings. Because the Otterhound was bred to hunt on land and in water, he has a rough, double coat and large, webbed feet. He comes in many different colors, the most common being a variation of black and tan grizzle, which often gets lighter as the dog gets older.
The Otterhound has the distinctive and almost musical bark of the hound. This deep, loud, extended bay is music to a hunter’s ears, but it might not play as well with the neighbors. Although some Otterhounds are quiet, most seem to like the sound of their own voices, so it’s wise to teach your Otterhound a “quiet” command. Speaking of voices, the Otterhound also has various vocalizations, from grunts to groans. Some even like ” singing ” and vocalizing with other dogs or people. Otterhounds are usually good with other dogs and animals if raised with them or introduced carefully. The Otterhound benefits from a lot of socialization, especially as a pup, and it’s good for him to be included in all aspects of your life.
Otterhounds tend to be opinionated, so training requires patience, especially since they become especially playful when they don’t want to comply with whatever you’re asking them to do. And because of their large size, training is absolutely necessary. Despite size and strength, however, the Otterhound has a “soft” personality; he doesn’t respond to harsh training methods. It’s best to be even more stubborn than he is while keeping the training sessions short, fun, and positive for both of you. The Otterhound enjoys food, which can be a great motivator in training. Be aware that his love of food can lead him astray: there are stories of Otterhounds who have learned to escape from any confinement to get into the kitchen, where they open cabinets, drawers, and even the refrigerator to steal a tasty tidbit.
The Otterhound needs exercise and a lot of it. He has great stamina and energy; jogging for three or four miles is like a walk in the park to him. If left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, especially without enough exercise, the Otterhound will find ways to entertain himself–ways that are apt to displease you, such as nonstop baying or excavating your newly planted flower garden. The hardworking Otterhound can be trained to compete in obedience and agility. He excels in tracking, and the percentage of Otterhounds who earn American Kennel Club tracking titles is usually higher each year than for any other breed. Despite his size, strength, and impressive bark, the Otterhound isn’t suited to guard duty — he’s far too friendly to take the watchdog job seriously.
Hunting Heritage: The Otterhound’s origins trace back to medieval England, where it was specifically bred for hunting otters. Its name reflects its historical purpose.
Distinctive Appearance: Recognizable by its shaggy and water-resistant double coat, pendulous ears, and loose, hanging skin, the Otterhound has a unique and charming appearance.
Large and Powerful: As a large and robust breed, the Otterhound possesses strength and endurance, reflecting its history as a working dog in challenging terrains.
Friendly and Sociable: Known for its amiable nature, the Otterhound is a sociable dog that typically forms strong bonds with its family. It tends to get along well with children and other pets.
Moderate Exercise Needs: Despite its hunting background, the Otterhound doesn’t have excessively high exercise requirements. Regular walks and playtime are important to keep it happy and healthy.
Distinctive Voice: Otterhounds are known for their unique vocalizations, ranging from a deep bay to a melodious howl. This trait adds to their charm and individuality.
Rare Breed: The Otterhound is considered a rare breed, with declining numbers. Its scarcity can make finding a responsible breeder a bit challenging.
Adaptable Living Conditions: While the Otterhound can adapt to various living environments, its large size suggests that it is more suitable for homes with ample space.
Grooming Requirements: Regular grooming is essential to maintain the Otterhound’s coat, prevent matting, and ensure overall cleanliness.
Independent Thinkers: Otterhounds can be independent and somewhat stubborn, requiring patient and consistent training. Their intelligence and problem-solving abilities are notable.
Versatile Family Companion: Despite its hunting background, the Otterhound has transitioned into a role as a beloved family companion, bringing joy and affection to its human family members.
While it’s fairly certain that Otterhounds descended from Bloodhounds, some think they might also be related to French Griffons because of the distinctive fold of their ears. The breed was developed in England to hunt and destroy otters, which were decimating the fish in English rivers. Otter hunting, largely enjoyed by the nobility, was the first organized sport in England that used packs of scent hounds. It was first mentioned in the 12th century, during the reign of Henry II. The Otterhound, however, was not mentioned as a specific breed for another 200 years. The Otterhound was used, along with small terriers, to hunt otters along the banks of ponds and rivers. Terriers flushed the otter from its den; when the otter ran to the water, the Otterhound took over. The Otterhound’s nose is so sensitive that he can follow not only the “wash” (the scent of the otter in the water) but also the “drag,” the trail of the otter on land. The dogs have been known to stay on 12-hour-old trails and to swim and wade as far as 20 miles in a day.
With his rough, weather-resistant outer coat; slightly oily undercoat; big, webbed feet; and size, strength, and determination, the Otterhound did his job so well that eventually otters were declared a protected species in England. Otter hunting became illegal in 1982 (although some people then used their Otterhounds to hunt mink). Along the way, however, the Otterhound picked up many notable admirers. It’s said that the Otterhound was fancied by more kings (and one queen) than any other breed. Included among the Otterhounds’ royal fanciers were Edward II, Henry VI, Richard III, Henry VIII, King John, Charles II, Edward IV, Henry II, Henry VII, and Elizabeth I. Otter hunting reached its peak popularity in the years immediately before World War I. At that time there were more than 500 hounds, in 24 packs, that hunted otter in England. Most of these dogs weren’t purebred Otterhounds, however, because hunters continued to crossbreed to improve the prowess of their dogs. Otterhounds appear to have been brought to the United States in 1900. They were first entered in a conformation show in 1907 Claremont, Oklahoma. The Otterhound Club of America was founded in 1960, and the first National Specialty took place in 1981. The Otterhound was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1991.
Males are approximately 27 inches tall and weigh about 115 pounds. Females are approximately 24 inches tall and weigh about 80 pounds.
The Otterhound is an amiable fellow, with plenty of affection for every member of the family. He loves children, though he can play a little rough (not purposely) due to his large size. He is devoted to his family, but not overly so. He’s likely to extend happy greetings when you come home at the end of the day, but don’t expect him to follow you from room to room. He’s too independent for that. The Otterhound’s characteristic independence makes training challenging. You have to convince him that he wants to do what you’re asking. This is entirely possible, as long as you are patient and skilled.
The good-natured Otterhound is not a top candidate for a watchdog. He’ll sound a loud warning bark to intruders, but that’s about it. As with every dog, the Otterhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they’re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Otterhound puppy grows into a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and taking leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Otterhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Otterhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.
Because of his large size and high activity needs, the Otterhound is not recommended for apartment dwellers or families without yards. He’s perfect, however, for active families who can take him jogging or, better yet, swimming each day. If he has enough exercise, he’s relatively inactive when inside the house. The Otterhound can sleep outdoors in temperate and cool climates with adequate shelter.
However, since he loves to be near his family, despite his independent nature, he can become bored and start barking, digging, or trying to escape if left alone too much. Invisible electric fences are not adequate for containing the otterhound. Training and socialization are essential for the otterhound, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your otterhound pup with you wherever he’s allowed, be it the lumber yard, the pet supply store, outdoor events, or on long walks in busy parks.
Anyplace where there are many people to meet and sights to see is a good place to take an Otterhound. Don’t let your Otterhound off his leash in such places, even if you think he’ll come reliably when called. His instinct is to follow his nose, and that, coupled with his independent nature, means he’s likely to take off after any interesting scent.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. For more on feeding your Otterhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
You might say the messy look is “in” with the Otterhound. This characteristically scruffy-looking breed has a double coat. The outer coat is two to six inches long, rough, and thick. The undercoat is woolly and slightly oily. With this combination, the Otterhound is relatively weather-resistant, and he can bound in and out of streams and lakes without the undercoat absorbing a great deal of water. The Otterhound’s coat color is any recognized hound color except liver and white, all white, or white with distinct black and tan patches. Black and tan grizzle is common.
The shaggy Otterhound coat sheds and must be brushed at least once weekly to avoid matting. Some Otterhounds have softer coats that require brushing at least two to three times a week to prevent mats. The Otterhound coat is best kept au naturel, so it is not clipped. If you decide to clip because the coat is matted or because your dog has a skin condition, it takes about two years for the coat to grow back to its original length. You may need to wash his beard daily because it tends to drag in his food or on the ground, and if you don’t keep the beard clean, it can develop an unpleasant odor.
Brush your Otterhound’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn’t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. They’re too long if you hear them clicking on the floor. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far, you can cause bleeding. Your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you’re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.
Since they are long and hang down, they don’t allow the best air circulation, and ear infections can result. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog’s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don’t insert anything into the ear canal; clean the outer ear.
Begin accustoming your Otterhound to being brushed and examined when he’s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you’ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he’s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, nose, mouth, eyes, and feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Otterhounds are boisterous, fun-loving dogs, but because of their size and tendency toward clumsiness, you should supervise them when they are with small children. They love children and wouldn’t hurt them intentionally, but their size and exuberance might cause them to knock a small child to the ground. The Otterhound is probably better suited to a family with older children, ages 10 and up. If properly trained and socialized, the Otterhound gets along well with other dogs. However, use caution when introducing him to small pets. The Otterhound’s hunting instinct is strong, and he’s likely to chase animals he perceives as prey.
Otterhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Otterhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don’t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Otterhound rescue.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems or socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.

Otterhounds are large, goofy dogs that can be a bit messy. They love to muddy and aren’t known for being elegant eaters. Otter hunting was outlawed in the United Kingdom in the 1970s, which resulted in a steep decline in the number of Otterhounds. The breed came close to extinction, and there are still not that many around.

Because Otterhounds aren’t that common, it can be challenging to find puppies in shelters; working with a reputable breeder is often the easiest way to locate healthy dogs.
Organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC) and Otterhound Club of America (OCA) can be great resources. Breed rescue organizations are also options for those interested in adopting adult dogs.
Otterhound puppies generally benefit from getting started with training as early as possible. It’s the best way to prevent unwanted behavior from even getting started. Early training and socialization help puppies gain confidence and develop into well-behaved adults. Short, fun training sessions that involve plenty of treats and praise are best since puppies don’t have incredibly long attention spans.
Consistency, patience, and positivity are essential. Sticking with routines can encourage puppies to feel safe and secure and give them a framework within which to learn.

Otterhounds are lively and loving. They’re happy to shower the people they care about with affection, and they have wonderfully goofy personalities.
Since they’re sloppy eaters, their food and water usually end up all over the floor after mealtimes. They’re also known for being a bit on the clumsy side when hanging out at home.
Otterhounds are relatively independent, and many are happy to spend time alone. They’re not typically great guard dogs, but most are good at keeping an eye on things and letting their humans know if something is amiss.
They’re very food-motivated and talented at breaking into cabinets and opening refrigerators to get hold of tasty snacks.
Otterhounds are loving and devoted, and they can make great family dogs for those with the time and space to meet their needs. Because they have so much energy, they’re best suited for homes with older children.
Otterhounds are pack animals, and they enjoy having canine companionship at home. However, they should be supervised when playing with small dogs to prevent injuries when they play rough.
Those with solid training and good social skills can sometimes get along fine with cats.

Otterhounds thrive when eating life-stage appropriate, high-quality commercial kibble and wet food. Growing puppies and adult dogs have different nutritional needs and should stick with formulas explicitly designed for their age group.
Large-breed puppies and dogs have slightly different nutritional and dietary needs than smaller pets and should be fed products designed to meet their needs. Large-breed puppies grow particularly fast, which can put them at risk of developing conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia, so they benefit from food that manages their growth rates.
Otterhounds need long daily walks to stay in top shape. Most love swimming and generally exploring the outdoors. They do well when they have yards to enjoy so they can run and explore without being constrained by a leash.
They like training for agility and tracking competitions that involve mental and physical workouts. Scent walks provide Otterhounds with opportunities to explore the world using their incredibly powerful noses, which can go far to keep them happy.
Although they’re trainable, Otterhounds can also be a bit stubborn, so getting them motivated to learn new things is sometimes a challenge. They bond closely with their owners and do incredibly well with reward-based training, particularly when it involves lots of praise.
Otterhounds are sensitive, which makes positive training even more important to ensure the establishment of strong human-canine bonds. Harsh training techniques can be counterproductive, and they can cause them to dislike training and lose trust in the trainer.
Otterhounds have double coats designed to keep them warm while hunting. The outer layers of their coats are waterproof and stiff to the touch, while their undercoats are nice and soft.
They need to be brushed a few times a week to keep their shaggy coats under control, and their facial hair needs regular attention after meals. Dogs with longer coats that produce more oil need monthly baths, but those with shorter coats require fewer.
Otterhounds must be thoroughly dried after getting wet to keep their coats healthy. Like all dogs, their teeth should be regularly brushed to help limit plaque and tartar accumulation. Their nails also need trimming, and their webbed feet benefit from regular cleaning.
Otterhounds are hardy canines, but they’re vulnerable to a few health conditions.
Bloat
Bloat occurs when a dog’s stomach expands due to food or gas. The blood flow to various organs is cut off as the condition progresses.
The stomach can also twist, resulting in the entire lower part of a dog’s body being cut off from blood. Bloat has the potential to be fatal if left untreated and is considered a medical emergency.
Veterinarians aren’t entirely sure what causes the condition, but dining from elevated bowls and exercising too soon after eating appear to be risks.
Hip Dysplasia
Dogs with hip dysplasia have trouble walking, standing, and navigating stairs. It’s a condition that often affects large dogs and appears to be at least partly genetic. Treatment options include medical management, physical therapy, and surgery.
Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a relatively rare condition in which uncontrolled electrical impulses in the brain cause seizures. Dogs with seizures often shake, twitch, and have convulsions. They can suffer from generalized, partial, and complex partial seizures.
All the other medical causes for a dog’s seizures must be excluded before a diagnosis of epilepsy can be given. There’s no cure for the condition, so treatment is aimed at reducing the seizure frequency.
The biggest difference between male and female Otterhounds is their size; males are taller and heavier. The dog’s sex doesn’t have much of an impact on their temperament and behavior if they have been spayed or neutered.
Neutered dogs are less aggressive than intact ones, and they’re less inclined to mount people and objects. Spayed dogs don’t go into heat, are protected from developing certain types of uterine conditions, and have lower chances of developing breast cancer.

Otterhounds were bred to be masterful in the water! They also have strong shoulders that make them incredibly powerful swimmers and noses that allow them to follow underwater scent trails like champs.
Airedales are Terriers bred to hunt rats and ducks and are the largest of the Terriers. Airedales average about 23 inches at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 70 pounds.
Griffon Vendeen, Griffon Nivernais, and Old Southern Hound blood may flow through Otterhounds’ veins. Otterhounds likely owe their fantastic noses (at least in part) to their Bloodhound ancestors.

Otterhounds are big, easy-going scent hounds that make excellent companions. They’re large, loving, loyal, and often a bit goofy. While they have incredibly charming personalities, Otterhounds require plenty of work to keep them happy and healthy.
They need long, daily walks and do best in homes where they have access to fenced yards. As pack animals, they get along with other dogs, and most are reasonably good around older children.

During this time the females start to attract males. You can notice by swelling vulva and bloody discharge.
The second part is the Estrus when the female is receptive for the male. It lasts for about 3 to 11 days.
The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color.
The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the female’s discharge changes for vivid red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating.
The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts about six months.

According to researchers the Otterhound, one of the most ancient of the British breeds, was developed in England to hunt otters. The references to this breed date back to the 12th century and at the time it was greatly loved by the nobility and also by several British Kings such as King John (1199-1216), Richard III, Charles II, Henry VI, and Queen Elizabeth who was also known as the first “Lady Master of Otterhounds”.
However, the origin of the breed is still unknown. We know that the breed reached its current form in the late 18th century and that many different breeds and combinations of breeds have been suggested as the foundation of the true Otterhound. For example; the Old Southern Hound, the Griffon Nivemais from France, the Bloodhound, the rough-coated Welsh Harrier or Foxhound, and Griffon Vendeen. On the other hand, some people believe that the breed is originated from France as some of the early writers such as Marples states that “it is almost the exact duplicate of the Vendeen Hound of France”.
As the breed’s name suggests, the otter was the dog’s preferred prey. Otterhounds were used in packs in order to protect food sources and control the otter population since otters competed with fishermen for the natural trout supply in rivers and lakes. The breed has a sense of smells so acute that it could smell, in the morning, if an otter passed through the water at the night before. The Otterhound also had great swimming ability by nature and would hardly stop even after hours and hours of swimming. Its naturally protective coat also helped to dive into the water and seek its prey even if it was cold. Furthermore, the breed was also used to hunt raccoons, bears, and mink. Besides the practical reasons, otter hunting also became one of the most famous sports found in England. In the late 1800s, there were more than a dozen packs operating in Britain during every hunting season. Not so much later, otter hunting reached its peak of popularity in the years preceding World War I. At the time there were more than 500 hounds in 24 packs which hunted otter, though most of these dogs were not purebred Otterhounds. Moreover, these hunt packs continued to cross-breed their hounds well into the 20th century to improve their hunting abilities. One of the results is that all current purebred Otterhound pedigrees go back to a Bloodhound/Griffon Nivernais cross done in 1958.
In the early 1970s, a drastic drop in the otter population occurred because of water pollution. It was decided that otter hunting has to be banned in England in 1978 and also in Scotland two years later. As a result, the Otterhound’s existence was severely threatened. To ensure the survival of the breed, the two remaining packs, The Dumfriesshire Otter Hunt of Scotland and The Kendal and District Otter Hunt of England worked together and also with several other breeders and the UK Kennel Club to register the remaining purebred hounds. Most of them were dispersed to private owners, with some going to the mink hunting packs.
The ‘purebred’ Otterhound we have today, was standardized sometime during the 19th century. Many generations of breeding for different purposes have strengthened the characteristics of the breed. The Otterhounds make a strong family companion as they are very attentive, loyal, affectionate, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Today there are fewer than 800 Otterhound's worldwide, with the largest numbers in the UK and US ( the Otterhound Club of America was founded in 1960) and with smaller numbers in Scandinavia, Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands.
