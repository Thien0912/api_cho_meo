Otherwise known as Hemingway or mitten cats, the American Polydactyl displays a unique mutation that makes your cat‚Äôs feet even more adorable. That‚Äôs right‚Äîthey are born with extra toes. How could you ask for anything more precious than that? Their dainty little paws are one of the many traits we know and love in our felines.
Height:
8‚Äì11 inches
Weight:
10‚Äì20 pounds
Lifespan:
12‚Äì15 years
Colors:
Any coat color on the cat spectrum
Suitable for:
Any cat-loving family, children older than 6
Temperament:
Lovable, even-keeled, fun-loving, smart
While this is a genetic defect, can you really seek out to find cats with this mutation? The answer is‚Äîabsolutely. The American Polydactyl cat is recognized by a few Cat Fanciers‚Äô clubs in America.¬†But you can find a polydactyl cat anywhere, even in an ordinary litter of kittens.

American Polydactyl cat personalities are wonderful with highly social attitudes. They tend to be very playful and fun-loving, taking to humans‚Äîstrange and familiar alike. But because these cats can carry so many different genetic traits, you never know exactly what you‚Äôre going to get.
Think of them as a sweet surprise. You might have an American Polydactyl that is calm, sweet, and laidback. Alternatively, they may be lively, bouncy, and sporadic. Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to pin down a solid personality type. But no matter their energy levels or particular personality, they‚Äôre usually very agreeable and affectionate overall. Each American Polydactyl has a speedy response time, so they are highly alert and excellent at hunting.
Historically, these cats are incredible mousers, so if you have any home intruders, your cat will take care of your problem. You won‚Äôt even have to set a trap!
American Polydactyls work well in families of all types because of their amiable and adaptable nature. These cats are a perfect combination of frisky and cuddly. You might find them wanting to chase your pant legs just to snuggle up with you 10 minutes later.
These cats are decently vocal but not overbearing. So, it won‚Äôt be like they‚Äôre annoying you while you‚Äôre sleeping with shrieks and cries on the regular. However, they may tell you if their food bowl is empty or if they want some attention by lightly meowing to get your attention.
They do exceptionally well with children who are older than 6 years because they can match their energy. Don‚Äôt let it deter you if you have very small kids. These cats are willing to run and hide rather than show any aggression toward children.
They are ideal companions in apartments, houses, condos, and practically any living circumstances. They even make decent candidates for outdoor living. While it isn‚Äôt recommended to have an outdoors-only cat, if you have a property for your kitty to roam, they may prefer it over in-home stays.
American Polydactyl cats love having a playmate around whether it‚Äôs a human, another kitty, or even a friendly dog. They won‚Äôt turn away a new friend. Granted, mutual respect is necessary to build good relationships, but these cats are adaptable and good-natured.
So, they might be more inclined to handle a hyper puppy or grumpy cat, simply brushing off the behavior or leaving them alone completely. They aren‚Äôt usually aggressive or territorial.

However, if you have two cats of the same gender together‚Äîand neither is fixed‚Äîyou may have some competition for the head of household. To prevent unwanted behavior, like spraying or marking, you can get both animals fixed as prevention.
Because American Polydactyl cats are insanely good hunters, this isn‚Äôt the best news for caged animals. Once your cat has their eye on your child‚Äôs rodent on a wheel or sees a fish swimming in a bowl, they may obsessively watch. And yes, they intend to kill‚Äîso be careful!
Always separate your cat from smaller animals. The prey drive merely is instinctual‚Äînot malicious. But there is little that can be done to prevent it. To keep everything running smoothly, never integrate the two‚Äîand always supervise any interactions regardless of whether you perceive there is a threat.
Your American Polydactyl will need a diet high in protein, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Most dry kibble on the market caters to a cat‚Äôs dietary needs with specifically designed formulas. Always make sure your cat food has minimal protein requirements, which is 35%.
Many cats have a rule‚Äîthe stinkier the food, the more they love it. They might ogle over wet food and prefer nothing but. However, wet food is generally good as a topper for kibble rather than a standalone diet. Wet food can cause tooth decay and weight gain‚Äîbut it‚Äôs fine in moderation.
American Polydactyls have a rich history. Their breeding has led to a modern-day hardy cat without many health concerns to mention. So, your cat probably won‚Äôt have any food restrictions right off the bat‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt mean some can‚Äôt develop.
If you think their diet is causing symptoms or gastrointestinal issues, consult with your veterinarian to put a new diet plan in place.

Your American Polydactyl should exercise themselves without help. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt partake in play since they won‚Äôt turn you down anytime you want to join in. However, their high energy levels typically help them take care of their minimal daily exercise requirement.
American Polydactyls will likely have a short 3-minute burst of energy a few times throughout the day. As long as their total daily exercise exceeds 15 minutes, you should be golden. As your cat ages, they may want to play less; this is also true after spaying or neutering.
To prevent obesity, offer lots of enticing toys to occupy your cat. Indoor cats tend to gain more weight than outdoor cats since they may be more lackadaisical. Having the appropriate exercise regimen and diet plan in place will keep your guy or gal in top-notch health.
Training your American Polydactyl should be a breeze. They tend to be brilliant cats to pick up on concepts quickly. When they are kittens, litter training them should happen relatively fast.
Initially, you should restrict their space, allowing them to only be in one room rather than roaming the entire house. When you introduce them to their litter box and start using the bathroom there, don‚Äôt clean it out immediately. The more they get used to the scent of the litter box, they will remember that they relieve themselves there‚Äîand nowhere else. Soon, your cat can freely roam around with no restrictions.
Spraying is another story. If you allow your cat to reach sexual maturity without spaying or neutering, there is always a risk they will start marking. While you can try to curb this behavior, the best solution is to have them fixed before the problem begins.
If you want to teach your American Polydactyl tricks, good luck. They tend to have a mind of their own and typically only do things if it suits them. It doesn‚Äôt mean that if you work with them and if you can‚Äôt get them to do acts on command. It just means you may have to give them a little motivation first.

When it comes to grooming, your American Polydactyl will do all of the hard work for you. They tend to groom themselves quite frequently, and you should only have to bathe them approximately once a month‚Äîif that. American Polydactyls have short hair, so you won‚Äôt have to worry about matting clumping, or tangling. Their slick coat offers a hassle-free care experience.
American Polydactyl cats are extremely resilient and don‚Äôt run into health issues often. If you are an owner who wants to minimize vet bills, this is a perfect breed to have. They have no long list of potential ailments specific to the breed, although they can run into any common issue among felines as a whole.
Because of their unique feet, it can sometimes cause issues with the paws and joints. If their toes or claws grow irregularly because of their extras, it can cause problems in the area. It isn‚Äôt common, but it can happen. It will depend on each individual polydactyl cat.
You can get ahead of any issues by keeping up with regular vet appointments to ensure the wellness and health of your kitty.
There are notable differences between male and female American Polydactyls in terms of looks. The males are larger than the females and tend to have an all-around ‚Äúblockier‚Äù look. Both of them are heavy-boned cats, but females are a bit lighter and more graceful.
Both male and female American Polydactyls are quite friendly. However, females tend to be a little more reserved or shy than their outgoing male counterparts. They might also be more attached to one person above all. Both might favor one person. It‚Äôs just that females can be a bit more particular about who they show their affection to. Males are a little more freely loving but are also slower to mature.
Both males and females can spray but it is much more common in males, especially if they are around unaltered cats. You can fix this issue by spaying at neutering before sexual maturity, which is around 6 months.
Any personality traits aren‚Äôt the same across the board. You might have an incredibly loving and social female and a male who is more aloof. These characteristics depend solely on the individual.

These cats didn‚Äôt get the nickname ‚ÄúHemingway cats‚Äù for nothing. American novelist Ernest Hemingway owned several of these cats, and you can find his accounts throughout his lifetime.
Long ago, sailors felt that if a cat sported extra toes, they were lucky to have aboard their ship. Because they were considered both lucky and excellent mouse-catchers, they joined many sailors on adventures. Their popularity exists in higher numbers in many coastal areas today.
Having these extra toes has a few perks! It intensifies their hunting power, making it easier to catch prey in its clutches. It also helps them with overall balance, making them stealthier and quick on their feet (pun intended).

If you‚Äôre even more in love with American Polydactyl kittens now, you probably want to begin the hunt for your very own. You can search for a reputable breeder in your area who has some of these adorable mittens cats.
Remember, it‚Äôs not uncommon to find one at a local shelter. There are lots of homeless kitties, extra toes and all, waiting for a forever home.

A polydactyl cat is a cat with a congenital physical anomaly called polydactyly (also known as polydactylism or hyperdactyly), which causes the cat to be born with more than the usual number of toes on one or more of its paws. Cats with this genetically inherited trait are most commonly found along the East Coast of North America (in the United States and Canada) and in South West England and Wales.
Polydactyly is a congenital abnormality that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some cases of polydactyly are caused by mutations in the ZRS, a genetic enhancer that regulates expression of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene in the limb.[1] The SHH protein is an important signalling molecule involved in patterning of many body elements, including limbs and digits.
Normal cats have a total of 18 toes, with five toes on each fore paw, and four toes on each hind paw; polydactyl cats may have as many as nine digits on their front or hind paws. Both Jake, a Canadian polydactyl cat, and Paws, an American polydactyl cat, were recognised by Guinness World Records as having the highest number of toes on a cat, 28.[2] Various combinations of anywhere from four to seven toes per paw are common.[3] Polydactyly is most commonly found on the front paws only; it is rare for a cat to have polydactyl hind paws only, and polydactyly of all four paws is even less common.[4]
The condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the East Coast of North America (in the United States and Canada)[5] and in Western England and Wales.[4] Polydactyl cats have been extremely popular as ship's cats.[5] Although there is some controversy over whether the most common variant of the trait originated as a mutation in New England or was brought there from Britain, there seems to be agreement that it spread widely as a result of cats carried on ships originating in Boston, Massachusetts, and the prevalence of polydactyly among the cat population of various ports correlates with the dates when they first established trade with Boston.[5] Contributing to the spread of polydactyl cats by this means, sailors were long known to value polydactyl cats especially for their extraordinary climbing and hunting abilities as an aid in controlling shipboard rodents.[5] Some sailors thought they bring good luck at sea.[5] The rarity of polydactyl cats in Europe may be because they were hunted and killed based on superstitions about witchcraft.[5]
Genetic work studying the DNA basis of the condition indicates that many different mutations in the same ZRS area can all lead to polydactyly.[1]
Author Ernest Hemingway became a famous aficionado of polydactyl cats after a ship captain gave him a six-toed cat that he named Snow White.[6][7][8] Upon Hemingway's death in 1961, his former home in Key West, Florida, became a museum and a home for his cats, and it currently houses approximately 50 descendants of his cats (about half of which are polydactyl).[8] Because of his love for these animals, polydactyl cats are sometimes referred to as "Hemingway cats".[8][9]
Nicknames for polydactyl cats include Hemingway cats,[8][9] mitten cats,[8] conch cats, boxing cats, mitten-foot cats, snowshoe cats, boston-toed cats, "providence cats", thumb cats, six-fingered cats, and Cardi-cats. Two specific breeds recognized by some cat fancier clubs are the American Polydactyl and Maine Coon Polydactyl.
American Polydactyl cats are bred as a specific cat breed, with specific physical and behavioral characteristics in addition to extra digits.[10]
The American Polydactyl is not to be confused with the pedigree Maine Coon Polydactyl. The polydactyl form of the Maine Coon is being reinstated by some breeders.[11][self-published source?]
In the case of preaxial polydactyly of the Maine Coon cat (Hemingway mutant) a mutation of the cis-regulatory element ZRS (ZPA regulator sequence) is associated. ZRS is a noncoding element, 800 kilobasepairs (kb) remote to the target gene SHH. An ectopic expression of SHH is seen on the anterior side of the limb. Normally SHH is expressed in an organiser region, called the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) on the posterior limb side. From there it diffuses anteriorly, laterally to the growth direction of the limb. In the mutant mirroring smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the posterior side of the limb. This ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits.[12][13] An identical sequence at this position serves the same function in human and mice and cause similar symptoms when mutated. Different mutations have different specific effects: for example, while the Hemingway (Hw) mutant tends to mostly induce extra fingers in the fore limbs, many other mutations affect the posterior limbs too.[1]
Polydactyly is a spontaneous complex phenotypic variation, developed in one generation. In the concrete preaxial form of the Hemingway (Hw) mutant the variation is induced by a single point mutation in a noncoding cis-regulatory element for SHH. In an extensive phenotypic variation like this, one or more complete digits at each single limb are developed including nerves, blood vessels, muscles and ligaments. The physiology of the digits can be perfect. This complex phenotypic result cannot be explained by the mutation alone. The mutation can only induce the variation. In the consequence of the mutation, thousands of events, each different from the wildtype, occur on different organisation layers, such as expression changes of other genes, cell-cell signal exchange, cell differentiation, cell and tissue growth. The summarized small random changes on all layers build the raw material and the process steps for the generation of the plastic variation.[3] The mentioned form of polydactyly of the Hemingway mutant shows a biased variation. In a recent empirical study first the number of extra toes of 375 mutant Maine Coon cats were variable (polyphenism) and second, the number of extra toes followed a discontinuous statistical distribution. They were not equally distributed as one might expect of an identical single point mutation. The example demonstrates that the variation is not explained completely by the mutation alone.[3]

Polydactyl cats, also known as ‚ÄúHemingway cats,‚Äù are a unique and fascinating feline breed characterized by an unusually high number of toes. While most cats typically have five toes on their front paws and four on their hind paws, polydactyl cats can have more than the standard number, giving them a distinctive appearance. This genetic trait is not limited to a specific breed and can be found in various cat breeds and mixed-breed cats.
One of the most notable features of polydactyl cats is their extra toes, which can vary in number and appearance. Some may have just one or two extra toes, while others can have up to seven or even more on a single paw. These extra toes can be fully formed and functional, resembling miniaturized additional paws, or they may appear as small, non-functional growths.
Polydactylism is believed to be a hereditary trait, and it has been associated with various breeds, including the Maine Coon and the American Shorthair. However, it‚Äôs important to note that polydactyl cats can be found in many breeds and in mixed-breed cats as well. These extra toes provide them with a unique advantage, often resembling thumbs, which can make them particularly dexterous and skilled at tasks like opening doors or manipulating objects.
The origin of the term ‚ÄúHemingway cats‚Äù comes from the famous American author Ernest Hemingway, who had a special fondness for polydactyl cats. He was given a polydactyl cat by a ship‚Äôs captain, and this cat‚Äôs descendants still roam the Hemingway Home and Museum in Key West, Florida. Due to this connection, the term is often used to refer to polydactyl cats in general.
Polydactyl cats are cherished for their charming and distinctive appearance. Their extra toes add to their overall cuteness and uniqueness. They are popular pets in many households due to their endearing characteristics and playful personalities. While their extra toes are a prominent feature, it‚Äôs important to note that they do not cause any harm to the cat and do not require special care.

There are various types of Polydactyl cats, each with its own unique characteristics and genetic backgrounds. Polydactylism is not limited to a specific breed but can be found in different cat breeds and mixed-breed cats. Here are some notable types of Polydactyl cats:
The Polydactyl Maine Coon is a charming variation of the well-known Maine Coon breed, famous for its large size, tufted ears, and luxurious fur. What sets the Polydactyl Maine Coon apart is its extra toes, which can be found on one or more of its paws. These extra toes add to the Maine Coon‚Äôs already impressive presence and make them even more captivating. Known for their gentle and sociable nature, Polydactyl Maine Coons are beloved companions for those who appreciate their striking appearance and friendly disposition.
The American Polydactyl Cat, often associated with the ‚ÄúHemingway cat‚Äù due to its connection to the famous writer Ernest Hemingway, is a unique and cherished feline breed. These cats can have extra toes on one or more of their paws, giving them a distinctive and endearing appearance. The American Polydactyl Cat is not limited to a specific breed but can be found in various breeds and mixed-breed cats. They are known for their playful personalities and their exceptional dexterity, often resembling having thumbs, which makes them adept at manipulating objects. These cats hold a special place in the hearts of cat enthusiasts and admirers of literary history, thanks to their association with the iconic author Ernest Hemingway.
The cats residing at the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum in Key West, Florida, are predominantly Polydactyl cats. These felines are descendants of the original cat gifted to Ernest Hemingway. What‚Äôs fascinating about these cats is the diversity in their extra toes. Some have extra toes on just one paw, while others may have them on multiple paws, leading to a captivating array of appearances among them.
American Shorthair cats, a breed known for their adaptable and easygoing nature, can also exhibit Polydactylism. These cats have extra toes, often on their front paws, which enhance their appeal. The additional digits contribute to their unique look and playful disposition.
Polydactylism is not confined to purebred cats and can be found in mixed-breed cats as well. These cats may have a diverse genetic background, and the presence of extra toes adds to their individuality. The numbers and functionality of the extra toes can vary widely among mixed-breed Polydactyl cats, making them intriguing and delightful pets.
The history of Polydactyl cats dates back several centuries. It‚Äôs believed that this genetic trait originated in England and was brought to North America by early settlers. Polydactyl cats have been documented in various regions, including coastal areas of the United States and Canada. Their unique appearance and extra toes have captured the attention of cat enthusiasts and led to their popularity in different parts of the world.
Polydactyl cats exhibit a distinctive appearance due to their extra toes. These additional digits can vary in number and size, making each cat unique. Some may have fully formed extra paws, while others may have smaller, non-functional growths. These extra toes give them a charming and endearing look, often resembling tiny mittens on their paws.
Polydactyl cats are known for their friendly and sociable temperament. They are often described as affectionate and playful, making them wonderful companions. Their extra toes do not affect their personality, and they are cherished for their loving nature and their ability to form strong bonds with their owners.
In terms of behavior, Polydactyl cats are not significantly different from other cats. They exhibit typical feline behaviors such as playing, hunting, grooming, and exploring their surroundings. However, their extra toes can sometimes make them more dexterous and skilled at manipulating objects, which can lead to entertaining and unique behaviors.
Polydactyl cats are known for their charming and sociable personalities. They are often outgoing and enjoy interacting with their human family members. Their playful and affectionate nature makes them highly sought-after pets. Their extra toes, which can resemble thumbs, contribute to their adaptability and ability to engage in various activities.
The world record for the most toes on a Polydactyl cat is held by a cat named Jake, who had a staggering 28 toes. Jake‚Äôs remarkable condition garnered widespread attention and made him a unique and extraordinary feline. However, it‚Äôs essential to note that most Polydactyl cats do not have such an extreme number of extra toes.
Polydactylism is not necessarily associated with inbreeding. While it can be more prevalent in certain lines of cats, it is primarily a genetic variation. Inbreeding can potentially increase the likelihood of Polydactylism, but many Polydactyl cats are not the result of inbreeding and are healthy and well-adjusted pets.
Polydactyl cats are not exceedingly rare, but they are less common than cats with the standard number of toes. The prevalence of Polydactylism varies depending on the region and specific cat populations. In some areas, such as coastal regions of the United States, they may be more commonly found due to historical connections. However, their charming and distinctive appearance makes them highly valued among cat enthusiasts and admirers of unique feline traits.

Cat Breeds
Also known as Hemingway cats in honor of the cats that roam Ernest Hemingway's estate in Florida, most American polydactyl cats are born with at least one extra toe on each front foot. Some polydactyl cats have extra toes on their hind feet as well. A select few have extra toes only on their hind feet and not on their front feet.
Even though the American polydactyl cat is not officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association of America, and even though it is not a specific breed of cat, it is adored for its cute, whimsical appearance. The extra toes on a polydactyl cat's front paws lends to the illusion that the cat is wearing mittens or perhaps that it has opposable thumbs. Some polydactyl cats have so many extra toes that their paws are double the size of an average cat's paws.
The reality is that polydactyl cats can be of any breed, and they can be of any color. The only thing that makes a polydactyl cat stand out from others is the presence of those extra toes, which are caused by a genetic mutation.
Polydactyl cats do not have special nutritional needs. They require the same carnivorous diet eaten by all other domesticated cats. We recommend feeding your polydactyl cat a diet that consists of high-quality cat food.
Just like all other cats, American polydactyl cats benefit from regular grooming. The type of grooming required depends on your cat's hair coat. Cats with short hair need to be brushed or combed about once per week just to remove excess hair and cut down on shedding, while cats with long hair can benefit from daily brushing and combing.
You should also teach your cat to accept nail trimming from an early age. It‚Äôs particularly important to trim a polydactyl cat‚Äôs claws as they can sometimes grow at odd angles, leading to discomfort, snagging on things, and being a general nuisance. Keeping your cat's nails trimmed will spare your furniture and your skin, too!
American polydactyl cats benefit from regular exercise. Keeping your cat at a healthy weight can help reduce excess stress on their joints and feet, ensuring that they remain comfortable as they get older.
We recommend treating your cat to a tower for climbing and perching as well as a selection of toys including items they can play with on their own and interactive options such as laser toys and wands that get you in on the fun.
Polydactyl cats generally do not have any worrisome health conditions although some toes do have claws that can become ingrown when they aren‚Äôt trimmed properly. When their extra digits consist of soft tissue only, they can sometimes be prone to injuries; this is true when extra toes aren‚Äôt properly fused to other parts of the cat‚Äôs skeletal structure.
Some polydactyl cats do have deformities that are present at birth, including fused toes that can be painful. Since each individual is unique, the best approach is to have your vet take a look at your polydactyl cat‚Äôs feet and determine whether any problems might occur. If so, they can suggest treatment to help your cat live comfortably.
The average polydactyl cat lives in a long, healthy life similar to other members of its breed.
There is another health condition that appears similar to polydactyly. Feline radial hypoplasia causes extra toes to develop on a cat's feet. However, these extra toes grow alongside the cat's normal toes, causing the feet to be very large and very flat. While this condition might not cause pain, it can lead to serious foot deformities in subsequent generations when cats with feline radial hypoplasia are bred.
Even though the American polydactyl cat isn‚Äôt a specific breed, these cats share a unique genetic trait. Polydactyly is caused by a dominant gene that also causes hyperdactyly (extra toes or digits) in other mammals ‚Äì even humans can carry this gene!
There are different types of polydactyly in cats:
1. Preaxial polydactyly causes extra digits to form on the inside of the paw, causing the cat to appear as if it‚Äôs wearing mittens.
2. Postaxial polydactyly causes extra digits to form on the outer edges of the paw, leading to nicknames such as snowshoe cat, patty paws, or pancake paws.
It's worth noting that Pixie Bob and Maine Coon polydactyl cats are in categories of their own. At one time, an astonishing 40% of all Maine Coon cats had extra toes and it‚Äôs still quite common for these kitties to exhibit the polydactyl trait. Some Maine Coon breeders even select for it, as the Maine Coon Polydactyl is recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) and some smaller cat fanciers clubs.
Polydactyl Pixie Bob cats are so common that they are permitted to be shown and registered, so long as they have no more than seven toes on each foot.
For now, these are the only polydactyl cat ‚Äúbreeds‚Äù that can be shown. Other breed standards disqualify polydactyl cats, saying that they can‚Äôt be registered or shown, even if they have just a single extra toe.
Sailors considered polydactyl cats to be good luck. Their wide paws helped them keep their balance when water got rough and polydactyl cats are widely regarded as excellent hunters, often catching more mice than the average kitty.
Ernest Hemingway's estate in Key West, Florida is home to approximately 50 descendants of his polydactyl cat, Snow White. Approximately half of the cats at Hemingway's estate have extra toes, but all carry the gene that causes cats to have extra toes. It's a polydactyl paradise!
A harlequin tabby named Paws and an orange tabby named Jake are the current Guinness Book of World Records' champions. They‚Äôre tied for the world record, with 28 toes apiece.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The American Polydactyl, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed American Polydactyl or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies ‚Äî non-purebred cats ‚Äî as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase an American Polydactyl, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
American Polydactyl cats cost between $500 - $2,000.
American Polydactyl cats tend to be medium in size. A fully grown American Polydactyl cat might weigh between 7-15 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 10"-14" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for American Polydactyl is 14-16 years.
American Polydactyl are long-haired cats, so you do have to expect a certain amount of shedding from this breed, but they don't shed as much as other cat breeds.
I have 2 Maine coins they are really adorable not for sale !sorry!
I adopted a stray female, short haired, black and polydactyl and pregnant.  She‚Äôs had 5 kittens, one with thumbs and the other 4 all have 6-7 toes on each of their back feet.  A couple have extra front and back toes. There are quite a few polydactyl strays in my area. I‚Äôm currently treating my crew for chlamydia but everyone is doing really well.
I have a cat named Mia with 6 toes on a her paws. She‚Äôs all black with a white on her chest and paws. She‚Äôs a little over a year. I‚Äôve noticed her vision has gotten bad over time. Does her losing her vision have anything to do with being a American Polydactyl?
We had a stray kitten show up on our property that has 28 toes. It‚Äôs a beautiful flame point white kitten with blue eyes. Also on another point we had another stray that birthed 3 kittens all having 6 toes front and back
Wow, that‚Äôs fascinating! Thanks for sharing, Robert üôÇ

The American Polydactyl, also known as the Hemingway cat or simply polydactyl cat, is a unique breed of domestic cat that is known for having extra toes on their paws. In fact, their name "polydactyl" literally means "many fingers" in Greek. While most cats have five toes on their front paws and four toes on their back paws, the American Polydactyl can have up to seven toes on each paw.
This breed is not recognized by most cat fancier organizations as a separate breed, but rather as a genetic anomaly that can occur in many different breeds of cats. They are commonly found in coastal areas of North America, particularly in the Northeastern United States, where they were once popular on fishing ships due to their exceptional climbing abilities.
American Polydactyls are known for their friendly and affectionate personalities. They are social cats that enjoy the company of humans and other animals. They are playful and active, and enjoy playing with toys and climbing. Due to their extra toes, they have a unique ability to climb and grasp objects, making them excellent hunters and climbers.
In terms of appearance, American Polydactyls come in a variety of colors and patterns, and can be either longhaired or shorthaired. They have a medium-sized body with a broad chest and strong, muscular legs.
In general, American Polydactyls are a healthy breed with a life expectancy of 12-15 years. However, like all cats, they are susceptible to certain health issues, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and feline diabetes.
Overall, the American Polydactyl is a unique and affectionate breed that makes a great family pet. Their extra toes give them a distinct appearance and added abilities, making them a popular choice for cat lovers who appreciate a little bit of quirkiness in their pets.
