The Tibetan Terrier breed originated in the mountainous region of Tibet over 2000 years ago and is one of the oldest breeds to come out of that region. They were bred and kept by Buddhist monks (or Lamas) in monasteries, not as herders or hunters, but as companions, good luck charms, and occasionally guard dogs. The name "Tibetan Terrier" is somewhat of a misnomer as these dogs were not used for typical terrier work such as hunting or burrowing after small game, but the name was given by European travelers due to the dog's size, which is similar to terrier breeds known in the west. The breed was introduced to the western world in the 1920s.
Tibetan Terriers can suffer from joint issues when spayed or neutered too early. They may also be affected by geriatric heart murmurs, hypothyroidism, distichiasis, ceroid lipofuscinosis, vestibular disease, skin allergies, thyroid issues, bladder stones, periodontal disease, hip and patella issues, and cancer. They are also prone to eye disorders such as cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy. Genetic testing for these and other conditions including degenerative myelopathy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, primary lens luxation, progressive retinal atrophy is recommended.
Tibetan Terriers are known for their loyal, affectionate, and sensitive nature. They are usually very attached to their family members and can be wary of strangers. Despite their somewhat reserved nature, they can also be playful and lively, particularly when interacting with their loved ones. These dogs are intelligent and can be trained well with positive reinforcement methods, though they can also exhibit a stubborn streak.
The Tibetan Terrier has also been called Tsang Apso, meaning "shaggy or bearded dog, from the province of Tsang".Despite their name, Tibetan Terriers are not true terriers. The name was given by Westerners who noticed their size was similar to terrier breeds known in Europe.In Tibet, these dogs were often referred to as "Luck Bringers" or "Holy Dogs" due to their cherished status in the monasteries.Due to their origins in the rugged, mountainous terrain of Tibet, Tibetan Terriers are unusually agile and sure-footed, characteristics that can still be seen in the breed today.

The Tibetan Terrier is a medium-sized companion breed that originated as a watchdog for the Buddhist monasteries in Tibet. An ancient breed, the Tibetan Terrier has a long, double coat in various colors. Despite their name, they are not true terriers. The breed name was given to them by European travelers due to their resemblance to the small, fuzzy dogs of their native Europe. In Tibet, they are known as Tsang Apso or Dohki Apso, and are similar in appearance to the Lhasa Apso, although larger. The Tibetan Terrier temperament is affectionate, playful, and intelligent. They make wonderful family pets as they enjoy being with people and are fairly low-maintenance, other than their long coat which is beautiful but requires frequent grooming.
Loving, agreeable, and spunky, and these pups fit in well with just about any family, even apartment dwellers. However, they have a lot of energy and need plenty of exercise, and due to their watchdog heritage, Tibetan Terriers can be prone to barking. They also don‚Äôt like being left alone for long hours of the day and may be prone to separation anxiety. You may want to spend some time researching the breed‚Äôs care requirements before bringing home a Tibetan Terrier puppy.
When considering a Tibetan Terrier, it‚Äôs advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you decide to purchase, it‚Äôs crucial to choose a¬†reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Tibetan Terrier breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn‚Äôt excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it‚Äôs worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you‚Äôll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup‚Äôs inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as ‚Äúsit‚Äù, ‚Äústay‚Äù, ‚Äúcome‚Äù, and ‚Äúleave it‚Äù. Barking-related training commands including ‚Äúhush‚Äù or ‚Äúquiet‚Äù are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog‚Äôs behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you‚Äôre away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as ‚Äúeasygoing,‚Äù ‚Äútolerant,‚Äù ‚Äúresilient,‚Äù or ‚Äúthick-skinned,‚Äù are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog‚Äôs sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being ‚Äúhighly-sensitive‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always only mean ‚Äúhighly anxious‚Äù. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive‚Äìbarking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It‚Äôs essential to remember that individual dogs‚Äô tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it‚Äôs essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you‚Äôre away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog‚Äôs natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it‚Äôs still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man‚Äôs best friend, and it‚Äôs no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family‚Äôs side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog‚Äôs affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner‚Äôs emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it‚Äôs a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family‚Äôs needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you‚Äôre looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blas√© attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren‚Äôt always so family-friendly.


It‚Äôs important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they‚Äôre not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It‚Äôs essential to consider the dog‚Äôs personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog‚Äôs reactions to children‚Äôs actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they‚Äôre love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It‚Äôs important to note that breed isn‚Äôt the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they‚Äôll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It‚Äôs may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy‚Äôs early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they‚Äôll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and¬†exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash¬†in public.


However, it‚Äôs worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It‚Äôs essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal ‚Äúblowouts‚Äù and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog‚Äôs coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog‚Äôs fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog‚Äôs skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you‚Äôre someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn‚Äôt prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as ‚Äúheavy droolers,‚Äù some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you‚Äôve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you‚Äôre not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog‚Äôs normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn‚Äôt very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don‚Äôt require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as¬†Pugs¬†and¬†Shar-Peis¬†have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the¬†Basset Hound¬†or¬†Cocker Spaniel¬†must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a¬†professional groomer¬†or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it‚Äôs important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it‚Äôs advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you‚Äôre interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup‚Äôs parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The¬†CHIC¬†(Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog‚Äôs test results. It doesn‚Äôt indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog‚Äôs age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren‚Äôt affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed‚Äôs parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it‚Äôs essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog‚Äôs diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet‚Äôs specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog‚Äôs weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet‚Äôs individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to ‚Äúsit,‚Äù easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It‚Äôs crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren‚Äôt necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it‚Äôs staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It‚Äôs worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn‚Äôt always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or ‚Äúherd‚Äù their human family members. Of course, this isn‚Äôt always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It‚Äôs important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy‚Äôs development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren‚Äôt true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it‚Äôs a good idea to teach your dog commands like ‚Äúdrop it‚Äù or ‚Äúlet go‚Äù from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they‚Äôll start to use less pressure. It‚Äôs crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You‚Äôll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase ‚Äî and sometimes kill ‚Äî other animals. Anything whizzing by ‚Äî such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars ‚Äî can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you‚Äôll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren‚Äôt a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won‚Äôt chase, but you‚Äôll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog‚Äôs prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you‚Äôre considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you‚Äôre considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious ‚Äústrangers‚Äù put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it‚Äôs the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as ‚Äúquiet‚Äù or ‚Äúspeak.‚Äù Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog‚Äôs innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the ‚Äúescape artist‚Äù tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs‚Äô physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs‚Äô lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed‚Äôs energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog‚Äôs needs and the owner‚Äôs preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It‚Äôs also important to note that age doesn‚Äôt exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won‚Äôt be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it‚Äôs recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it‚Äôs advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog‚Äôs mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it‚Äôs pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a¬†dog‚Äôs behavior¬†as well. Dogs ‚Äî particularly¬†puppies¬†and young dogs ‚Äî have a lot of energy, and if they don‚Äôt get the chance to burn it off,¬†destructive behavior¬†is often the result. If you‚Äôre annoyed at your dog‚Äôs digging, have headaches from¬†barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a¬†leashed walk¬†around the block isn‚Äôt going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they‚Äôre slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog‚Äôs temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it‚Äôs essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you‚Äôre prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog‚Äôs individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It‚Äôs about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

Born in Tibet, Tibetan Terriers were bred in lamaseries to be companions not only to the holy men who raised them but also to nomadic herdsmen as they wandered the high plains with their flocks. The shaggy, medium-size dogs were thought to bring good luck, so they were never sold but only given as gifts or thanks for favors. People who live with the breed today understand just what a gift they are. The breed‚Äôs name is a bit of a misnomer, as the Tibetan Terrier is not a true terrier at all. He was given the name on account of his size, but he doesn‚Äôt share the terrier‚Äôs tendency to go to ground (dig for vermin) or the typically sharp-edged terrier temperament. Lively and fun loving, he is, but those characteristics are tempered with a sweet and kind nature. Beneath a fall of hair, his eyes twinkle with good humor. Like all dogs, Tibetan Terriers thrive on human companionship. It‚Äôs no wonder they excel as therapy dogs.
While they‚Äôre not demons for activity, they are active enough to compete in agility and do well in obedience and rally. Hearkening back to their history as lamasery alarm dogs, they are alert to anything different and make super watchdogs. Their gentle demeanor doesn‚Äôt suit them to work as guard dogs, however. It‚Äôs not unusual for Tibetan Terriers to be reserved with strangers, but they shower affection on their people. They can adapt to life in many different types of households and are a good choice for families with older children who understand how to treat dogs. With their protective double coat and large, flat, round feet to provide traction¬†‚Äî¬†in much the same way as snowshoes¬†‚Äî¬†they‚Äôre well suited to homes in snowy climates. The Tibetan Terrier is a pleasant dog who enjoys life and loves people. He‚Äôll adapt to life with a couch potato or an active family, always approaching every day with an endearing sense of humor and a sparkle in his eye.
Ancient Origins: Tibetan Terriers, despite their name, are not true terriers but rather a unique breed originating in the monasteries of Tibet.
Lively and Friendly: They are known for their lively and friendly temperament, making them excellent family companions.
Adaptability: Tibetan Terriers are adaptable dogs, comfortable in both city and country environments.
Double Coat: They have a double coat that can be long and shaggy, requiring regular grooming to maintain its health and appearance.
Intelligence: Tibetan Terriers are intelligent and can excel in various dog sports and activities.
Independent Thinkers: They have a streak of independence, which can sometimes make training a bit challenging, but their intelligence can be harnessed with patience and positive reinforcement.
Longevity: Tibetan Terriers have a relatively long lifespan, often living well into their teens.
Heritage: They are part of a heritage that goes back centuries, initially bred as companion dogs and watchdogs in Tibetan monasteries.
With its mountainous terrain, Tibet is sometimes referred to as the Roof of the World. It was in that harsh, high, remote land that the Tibetan Terrier was created. Prized as companions, the dogs were raised by Buddhist monks, known as lamas, from whom they took their name Holy Dog. But the shaggy, medium-size dogs weren‚Äôt limited to life in the lamaseries where they were born. Considered to be luck bringers, they traveled the high plateaus with nomadic herdsmen, guarding their tents. Fearful of tempting fate by ‚Äúselling‚Äù their luck, neither the lamas nor the herdsmen ever sold the dogs. Instead, they were given as gifts in return for favors or services or presented to officials as a mark of esteem. The Tibetan Terrier might have remained an obscure breed if not for a grateful Tibetan man who gave a Tibetan Terrier to Dr. Agnes R. H. Greig, who had saved his wife‚Äôs life. Dr. Greig named her new puppy Bunti and became a fan of the breed. Eventually, she acquired a male, also as a gift, and began a breeding program, establishing the Lamleh line of Tibetan Terriers.
Being neither a sporting dog nor a mix, the breed was given the name Tibetan Terrier, despite the fact that it wasn‚Äôt a true terrier in either instinct or temperament but merely resembled one in size. A breed standard was created by the Kennel Club of India in 1930, and the Tibetan Terrier was officially recognized by England‚Äôs Kennel Club in 1937. The first Tibetan Terrier imported into the United States, Gremlin Cortina, arrived in 1956. Owned by Dr. Henry S. and Alice Murphy, she was so beloved by them that she inspired Alice Murphy to establish her own kennel, Lamleh of Kalai. The Tibetan Terrier Club of America was formed in 1957, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1973. Today the Tibetan Terrier ranks 95th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Tibetan Terriers stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder and weigh 20 to 24 pounds.
The Tibetan Terrier is smart, pleasant, and affectionate. Gentle but fun loving, he‚Äôs dedicated to his family but may be cautious or reserved toward strangers. Puppies are active and lively¬†‚Äî¬†what puppy isn‚Äôt?¬†‚Äî¬†but settle down as they reach maturity. True to their heritage, they make wonderful watchdogs and will bark an alert if they see or hear anything suspicious. They don‚Äôt like to be left alone for long periods, preferring the company of the people they love. Tibetan Terriers are known for adaptability and a sense of humor.
Like every dog, Tibetan Terriers need early socialization¬†‚Äî¬†exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences¬†‚Äî¬†when they‚Äôre young. Socialization helps ensure that your Tibetan Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Tibetan Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions.
Tibetan Terriers are adaptable dogs at home in a variety of households, from condos to castles. They should live indoors with their people, not stuck out in a backyard or kennel. Once they‚Äôve matured, they are just as happy being couch potatoes as they are active family dogs. Like any dog, an adult Tibetan Terrier requires daily exercise to stay healthy and happy, but he‚Äôll be satisfied with a couple of 15-minute walks daily or one longer walk. Naturally, puppy and adolescent Tibetan Terriers are filled with energy and excitement and require higher levels of stimulation and exercise. Although it‚Äôs nice for a Tibetan Terrier to have a securely fenced yard where he can play, it‚Äôs not a great idea to leave him out there for long periods. A bored Tibetan Terrier is a barker, and a really bored Tibetan Terrier is an escape artist who‚Äôs perfectly capable of climbing, jumping, or digging his way over or under a fence. Housetraining can take time, but you‚Äôll be successful if you‚Äôre patient and give your Tibetan Terrier a regular schedule and plenty of opportunities to potty outdoors, praising him when he does so.
Crate training is strongly recommended. It will make housetraining easier and keep your Tibetan Terrier from chewing things while you are away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don‚Äôt keep your Tibetan Terrier locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Tibetan Terrier is with you. TTs are generally amiable, but sometimes they have their own agenda. Keep training fun, be consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.
Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.
How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don‚Äôt all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference¬†‚Äî¬†the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you‚Äôll need to shake into your dog‚Äôs bowl. For more on feeding your Tibetan Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Tibetan Terrier is protected by a double coat: a soft, woolly undercoat and an abundant topcoat with fine hair that can be wavy or straight. The long hair stops just short of the ground, enough that you can see light beneath the dog‚Äôs body. The hair often falls in a natural part along the spine. The Tibetan Terrier comes in a range of colors and patterns, including white, gold, tricolor, brindle, silver, black, and more. That long coat requires daily brushing during adolescence as the coat changes to keep it free of tangles. Once the adult coat has come in, by approximately 18 months of age, you can get by with grooming one to three times a week.
Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Tibetan Terrier‚Äôs teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar build-up and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they‚Äôre too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don‚Äôt get caught in the carpet and tear, and don‚Äôt scratch your legs when your Tibetan Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Tibetan Terrier to being brushed and examined when he‚Äôs a puppy. Handle his paws frequently ‚Äî dogs are touchy about their feet ‚Äî and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you‚Äôll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he‚Äôs an adult.
Tibetan Terriers love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but they‚Äôre a little rambunctious for households with children under the age of 6 years. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he‚Äôs sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog‚Äôs food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Tibetan Terriers usually get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they‚Äôre introduced to them in puppyhood.
For a variety of reasons, Tibetan Terriers sometimes end up in shelters and rescue organizations. If you‚Äôre interested in adopting an adult Tibetan Terrier who‚Äôs already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start. You can start with a few breed-specific resources below. You may also find Tibetan Terriers are other rescues dedicated to the welfare of the Terrier group.
Finding a reputable dog breeder¬†is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems, and they may not socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.

Tibetan Terriers, also commonly known as Tsang Apso, are medium-sized dogs, typically weighing between 8 and 14 kilograms, with the males tending to be slightly larger. Their coats come in a variety of colours, including shades of black, white, gold, cream, grey, and sable, often with beautiful patterns or parti-colour variations.
Beyond their distinctive physical appearance, Tibetan Terriers are renowned for their loving and loyal temperament and are known to be particularly protective of their family once trust is established.
Thanks to a healthy yearning for being active, Tibetan Terriers can be just as playful as they are snuggly which make them a popular dog choice for families.
Despite its name, the Tibetan Terrier is not actually a terrier breed. It is often confused with terriers due to its name and physical appearance, but it belongs to the non-sporting group (ANKC & ANC classification). In terms of temperament and certain physical features, the Tibetan Terrier can be somewhat similar to some terrier breeds, such as the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier - both these breeds share a similar coat texture with soft wavy hair, as well as a playful and affectionate nature. However, it is important to note that the Tibetan Terrier has its own unique characteristics and is a distinct breed in its own right.
Tibetan Terriers are generally friendly in nature and can be comfortably socialised with other pets or family members. Whilst they may be reserved with strangers, this dog breed has a keen sense of awareness which makes them naturally protective of those they form a bond with. Over time, they are able to pick up on the emotions of their owners and respond to their needs.
This independent and intelligent trait can sometimes manifest as stubbornness, but when properly socialised, Tibetan Terriers make for a charismatic canine companion.
Living with a Tibetan Terrier is a playful and loving experience, where the dog is a cherished member of the family. This breed enjoys walks and outdoor time just as much as a cosy evening at home, so with sufficient attention they are a content and happy dog.
Due to their distinctive double coat, Tibetan Terriers are high-maintenance when it comes to their grooming needs. Frequent brushing will be essential to prevent matting with occasional professional grooming needed for trims and shaping. When it comes to dietary needs, Tibetan Terriers are generally not picky eaters. A high-quality, balanced diet, along with portion control to prevent obesity, is recommended for maintaining their overall health and wellbeing.

Often known as the Tsang Apso, the Tibetan Terrier is an amazing breed with a history going back over 2,000 years in Tibet. Whilst this alternative name "Tsang Aspo," does not directly translate into a specific meaning, it does provide indication into the breed. "Tsang" refers to the region in Tibet where the dog breed originated from and "Apso" as a term, roughly means "long-haired " or ‚Äúshaggy bearded dog‚Äù.
Serving as loyal friends to Buddist monks, they were even considered as a symbol of good luck. They were bred within monasteries, developing a thick coat, ideal for the harsh Tibetan climate.
In the early 20th century, the Tsang Apso dog breed was first brought to England, and from then on was renamed Tibetan Terriers, offering a nod to their original home as they gained popularity in the western world. They remain a popular dog breed to this day for the very reasons Buddist monks chose them for companionship; loyalty.
Tibetan Terriers are known to be susceptible to several eye conditions, and it's important for potential owners to be aware of these.
The most common eye issues for this dog breed include:
‚Ä¢ Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) - a genetic eye disease that affects the retina, leading to progressive vision loss and, in severe cases, blindness.
‚Ä¢ Hip dysplasia: a condition that alters the inner workings of the hip joint.
‚Ä¢ Canine Multifocal Retinopathy (CMR) - an inherited eye disease that affects the retina and can cause varying degrees of vision impairment.
Genetic testing is also a recommended option as it can help identify whether your dog is a carrier of these eye diseases. This can also help to influence any breeding decisions which may affect future generations of the beloved Tibetan Terrier.
It is worth noting that not all Tibetan Terriers will develop these eye conditions, but understanding the potential risks allows owners to be proactive in monitoring their dogs' eye health.
In addition to regular veterinary care, owners can take preventive measures to support their Tibetan Terriers' eye health. This includes providing a nutritious diet rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, which can promote ocular health.
Maintaining a clean living environment, free from potential eye irritants, is also beneficial.
It is advised that any prospective pet parents are aware of potential health challenges faced with this breed and that you do your own research before ownership.
