--------------------------------------------------
The Sealyham Terrier was originally bred as a hunting dog to pursue particularly tough prey, such as foxes, badgers and polecats. Hailing from Pembrokeshire, it was developed through a ruthless selection process, in which only the fiercest hunters were allowed to survive. Despite its street-fighting credentials, it is often said to have the sweetest nature of any of the terrier breeds, and makes a wonderful companion that is adaptable to many different living situations.
Though less boisterous and easily riled than some of the other terriers, they make good watch dogs, being alert and quick to bark. They are happy in the company of other animals, including smaller pets, and although they prefer to spend time with their owners, can amuse themselves when required. This is a very healthy breed, though eye disorders are an issue, and breeders should always be asked to provide certificates verifying their dogs’ health before one considers making a purchase. The Sealyham Terrier has an average life expectancy of 12–14 years.
The Sealyham owes its existence to the efforts of one man. Described by his contemporaries as an “eccentric sportsman”, Captain John Tucker-Edwardes was a Pembrokeshire squire of the nineteenth century. Having taken up hunting with hounds while stationed in Gibraltar with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, he became a fanatical collector of hunting dogs on his return home to Sealyham House, overlooking the River Sealy. While he initially hunted the local badgers, otters, and polecats with Otterhounds and terriers of indeterminate pedigree, he grew dissatisfied with their abilities, and became determined to develop a breed of his own. His stated aims were to create a terrier of small stature, white in colour (to distinguish it from its prey), and with a strong jaw, and his breeding efforts began in 1848.
Unfortunately, he kept no written records of his breeding programme, but it is believed that another Pembrokeshire native, the Pembrokeshire Corgi, was instrumental in creating the longer back that was desired. Several other breeds, including the West Highland White Terrier, the Dandie Dinmont, and the Bull Terrier contributed to the final genetic make-up of the Sealyham. Though clearly a determined man, it is difficult to see Captain Tucker-Edwardes as a dog lover, for he was known to be quick to shoot those dogs that shied away from pursuing their quarry.
The Sealyham Terrier was recognised as early as 1911 by the Kennel Club, and became extremely popular with celebrities in the early days of Hollywood, sparking a great deal of public interest in the breed. In 1959, a British newspaper published a story that Princess Margaret would refuse her breakfast in bed each morning if her two Sealyhams were not brought to her at the same time. Despite making such an impact in high society, the breed suffered a drastic decline in popularity in the ensuing decades, and is now a rare one.
In 2008, only 43 pups were registered, representing an all-time low; however, the most recent figures from the Kennel Club show a slight improvement over the intervening years, with 113 new entries for 2016. Unfortunately, this is still below the critical level of three to five hundred thought to represent a diverse and healthy breeding population. The Sealyham retains a strong appeal for many within the confines of the show ring, and has won the prestigious Best in Show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show no less than four times, with its only victory in Crufts coming in 2008.
The Sealyham Terrier is an active, alert little dog, of considerable strength and substance. Its head is long, broad and slightly domed between the ears, and has a subtle indentation that runs down between the eyes. The shape of the square muzzle is often accentuated by the way in which its hair is clipped. The nose should be black and have large nostrils. It has a strong bite, with particularly well-developed canine teeth. The eyes are slightly oval in shape, very dark, and set wide apart and deep in the sockets, to provide protection from scratches and bites. The medium-sized ears are wedge-shaped, with rounded edges, and are folded forward to the side of the head.
The Sealyham’s body proportions are quite distinctive: as well as its long skull, it has a neck that is around two-thirds as long as the dog is tall. These two features combine to give the dog great reach when straining to get down a burrow or into a narrow space. The back is relatively short and stocky, but the breed is remarkably supple nonetheless. The chest is well let down between the forelegs with good spring.
The limbs are short and strong with good bone structure. Though both fore and hind limbs are set wide apart, due to the breadth of the chest and heavy muscling of the thighs, they should be straight and true when in motion and viewed from the front. Equally, the small, cat-like paws should be turned neither in nor out when standing. There is good angulation at the shoulder and stifle, allowing this little dog plenty of power and acceleration.
When left untrimmed, the Sealyham Terrier has a long, coarse topcoat, with a soft and dense undercoat that is weather-resistant. Many are all white in colour, but lemon, brown, blue, and badger markings are permitted around the face and ears. Black markings occasionally occur, but are not viewed favourably. As a terrier bred to go to ground, excessively long limbs are discouraged, and the breed standard does not specify a minimum height. Instead, both males and females must be less than 31 cm (12 in) tall at the withers, or the top of the shoulder blades. Males should ideally weigh around 9 kg (20 lb), and females 8 kg (18 lb).
As a long-time terrier owner myself, I would be among the first to admit that they are not always the easiest dogs to live with, given their propensity for stubbornness, barking, and relentlessly attacking the vacuum cleaner whenever it appears. The Sealyham, however, is a more laid back character than most of its terrier cousins.
Sometimes described as couch potatoes, they are calm and confident dogs, very affectionate toward their owners, and willing to accept the company of other dogs without complaint. Indeed, with their background as hunting dogs, they enjoy being part of a pack, and will even take to cats and other smaller pets, particularly if raised with them.
Though young children must be taught how to approach and handle dogs in an appropriate manner, it would take quite some provocation to elicit a bite from a Sealyham, and so they are a good choice of pet for families. They are sociable and inquisitive dogs, and will befriend visitors to the home rather than being standoffish and suspicious. However, although they generally lack aggression, they have enough terrier spirit to make good watch dogs, willing to bark when needed.
Sealyhams are clever, alert dogs that can learn a good repertoire of tricks and commands. However, for all their good points, they remain terriers, and are capable of being stubborn, selectively deaf, and easily distracted. Training sessions need to be kept short and stimulating, with plenty of positive reinforcement in the form of encouragement and the occasional treat.
Early socialisation of puppies is important for every breed, and young Sealyhams must be given the opportunity to meet new people and animals in a range of settings as soon as their primary vaccination course has been completed.
Health problems are very uncommon in the breed, especially for dogs coming from a healthy line. Because of the small population of Sealyhams at the present time, it is extremely important that anyone considering the purchase of one of these little dogs research their breeders carefully. As eye problems are the most common issue for the breed, prospective owners should insist on seeing certificates of ocular health for both puppies and parents.
Like many other terriers, the Sealyham is prone to this form of allergic skin disease, in which a hypersensitivity reaction to allergens absorbed through the lungs and/or skin results in intense itching and skin irritation. The ears, feet, and perineum are the areas most often affected. Common allergens include house dust mites, plants and pollens, and even other pets.
Though the condition is incurable in most cases, there is a huge range of treatments available that can help manage it and make the pet more comfortable.
Sealyham pups are occasionally born deaf, which is usually noticed by owners at around six weeks of age, when puppies become more responsive to the sounds in their environment.
The breed’s large head can cause problems in the birthing process, with the result that quite a lot of Sealyhams are born by Caesarean section. Inexperienced breeders must educate themselves as to the stages of labour and its expected progress, and should contact their veterinary surgeon at an early stage if they feel that their mum-to-be is experiencing difficulties.
Sight loss and ocular pain due to increased pressure within the eye is relatively common in the breed, but is most commonly caused by lens luxation, which is discussed below. Squinting, enlargement of the affected eye, and changes in behaviour are the signs most often noticed by owners.
As anyone who has ever cried will realise, there is a tear duct located at the medial corner of the eye that carries tears from the surface of the eye into the nose – hence the running nose that accompanies a good bout of sobbing. In some Sealyham Terriers, the entrance to this duct does not develop, with the result that tears overflow onto the face.
In most cases, this is simply a cosmetic issue, as it causes staining of the hair around the eyes. Occasionally, chronic dampness can cause skin infections, so it is a good idea to regularly clean this discharge away with a very mild antiseptic solution.
This is a common problem in many terriers, in which the fibres that suspend the lens in its normal position within the eye degenerate and weaken. As a result, the lens can fall into one or other of the eye’s chambers, potentially causing glaucoma (above) and loss of sight.
This most commonly occurs in middle-aged dogs, and if not recognised and treated promptly, can cause permanent loss of vision. There is a DNA test available to identify individuals at risk of lens luxation, and this should ideally be used to remove affected and carrier dogs from the breeding population.
This is another disorder affecting the eye, which usually results from trauma, such as a traffic accident. The retina, the delicate layer of nerve cells at the back of the eye responsible for vision, can become dislodged from its underlying attachments by blood or other fluids, usually resulting in permanent sight loss.
The Sealyham enjoys its walks, but rarely demands them. With access to a small outdoor space, most will get the majority of their exercise in the form of rooting through flowerbeds in search of rodents or insects. Lead walking for at least half an hour every day is the minimum requirement for any healthy dog, as it provides an opportunity to develop the bond between dog and owner, as well as teaching good manners and obedience.
When regularly groomed and trimmed, the Sealyham can look neat as a pin. However, the opposite is also the case, as its wiry coat is prone to tangles, and will grow quite long if allowed. For owners not wanting to clip the coat short, brushing at least three times a week is required, with hand stripping of dead hair, which amounts to quite a lot of work. A better option for many owners is to have their dog professionally groomed every six to eight weeks, which makes the hair much easier to manage.
In its heyday, the Sealyham was to be found at the feet of some of its most famous human contemporaries, including:
The Sealyham is such a rare commodity that it is not often cross-bred, though the Sealydale Terrier, the result of crossing it with an Airedale Terrier, is sometimes seen for sale.

The Sealyham Terrier is an independent, loyal, and affectionate dog. The Sealyham Terrier originated in Wales and is an avid hunter. The Sealyham is a rather small dog, but he can be stubborn at times. They were originally bred for badger, otter, and fox hunting; even now, a Sealyham finds great joy in chasing birds, rabbits, and other animals – including other dogs and cats. The Sealyham’s white coat was distinctly bred into the dog as hunters used the white coat to distinguish between the dog and the prey. The Sealyham Terrier was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1911. It remains a popular show dog, but a rare breed in America.
In the mid-1800s, Captain John Tucker Edwardes began developing the dog that would eventually become known as the Sealyham Terrier. The Sealyham was a mixture of the Bull Terrier, Basset Hound, West Highland White Terrier, Welsh Corgi, the Fox Terrier, Cheshire Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier. Captain Edwardes began breeding the dog for hunting tough but small game such as badgers, otters, and foxes. Edwardes kept crossing breeds until he found offspring that excelled in hunting ability. The Sealyham’s name comes from Captain John Tucker Edwardes’ estate, Sealyham. Edwardes was responsible for crossbreeding a number of dogs in order to produce the perfect hunting and gaming breed. Edwardes was rumored to have given neighboring farmers puppies; if, at eleven months, the puppies showed promise in hunting and gaming, Edwardes paid the farmer an extra fee to get the puppy back. The dogs became popular across England, and in 1903, the breed was first included in a dog show. England’s Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1910. The early 1900s saw great popularity in the little dog; they were often entered in dog shows throughout England. The American Kennel Club began recognizing the breed in 1911. A Sealyham Terrier has won “Best in Show” four times at the Westminster Dog Show. While the Sealyham is an excellent companion dog, they have never had the popularity with the American public that they had in England during the early 1900s. It remains a rare breed in the United States.
The Sealyham Terrier is a tiny dog; he has short but strong legs. He is rectangular in shape with a medium-sized tail that stands at attention. He possesses an alert and determined facial expression. His weather-resistant undercoat is soft; his outer coat is stiff and wiry. He is generally all-white; some dogs will present with white and lemon coloring. Other markings are brown, blue, or badger on the head and ears. His brown eyes have a sparkle that matches his personality and his black nose always points in the direction of an adventure.
The Sealyham Terrier has a double coat; he requires frequent combing (two or three times a week) in order to prevent matting. The coat should be shaped or stripped every three months. The dog needs a moderate amount of exercise. Games with a ball or daily walks can provide the right amount of exercise. Remember, the Sealyham is a born hunter, so letting him off the leash as he walks may be an invitation for trouble. They will follow their nose, tracking interesting scents. The Sealyham is highly intelligent and requires a firm handler. He is independent, but loves constant attention. He may challenge his owner’s authority from time to time, so consistency is key with a Sealyham Terrier. The dog can do well either in an apartment dwelling or out in a home with a fenced-in yard; as long as he receives adequate exercise, the Sealyham is happy.
The Sealyham is an active dog, yet he has a calm demeanor. He loves to chase other animals, even other household pets. He also loves to explore, dig, and bark. He is a very hard-working dog, and he can be strong-willed. It is of the utmost importance that handlers are gently firm with a Sealyham Terrier. They must be socialized to cats from a young age if owners wish Sealyhams to accept a feline friend. They are great watchdogs, and they are highly loyal and loving with their families. The Sealyham Terrier is good with older children who know how to handle them, and can be reserved around strangers.

The Sealyham Terrier is not commonly used as a companion dog. This is such a shame as these dogs make excellent pets!
These little dogs are protective yet friendly and energetic yet always down to relax.
Considering adopting or purchasing a dog can be exciting and stressful, mainly because you want to choose the right dog. This guide will provide everything you need to know about this breed.
The Sealyham terrier derives from its place of origin, the Sealyham estate in Southwestern Wales. It was developed in the 1800s by Captain John Edwardes, who dedicated most of his life to breeding this dog.
This breed was originally bred to hunt pesky otters who disturbed the Captain’s fishing expeditions. The Captain did not correctly document the breed. It is said that he had crossed other terrier breeds to develop this breed. The Bull terrier, Dandie Dinmont terrier, West Highland White Terriers and Fox Terriers.
The breed became popular in England that even the royal family had a Sealyham Terrier, and in 1908, the first English Kennel Club was created. They were later recognised by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1911, after which the American Sealyham Terrier Club was built in 1913.
It is a rare breed, and these purebred dogs, despite their great personalities as companion dogs, are not commonly had as pets.
Sealyham Terriers are considered one of the most endangered native breeds and are ranked 145 out of 155 on the English Kennel Club’s list.
The Sealyham Terrier is an affectionate breed that is more laid back than other terrier breeds, which are great for anyone who would love to settle down with their pup at the end of the day.
As hunting dogs, they have an innate desire to chase. If you live where smaller animals roam around, you may want to ensure that your Sealyham is fenced in. They love chasing rabbits and birds.
However, this does not discredit their ability to live in a household with other animals. These dogs are naturally pack animals and get along very well with other dogs and even cats, provided all animals are correctly socialised to be in each other’s space.
Sealyham Terriers are fun, intelligent dogs who can be put to work and do a great job but will also be great playmates to children. It is better to have them around older children who know to handle this sassy breed.
They can easily adjust to apartment living, provided they get daily exercise. They are known as the “couch potatoes of terriers”, so keep an extra space for them when you are getting ready to lounge about while watching television.
They can easily adapt to both city and country life. The Sealyham is your typical house dog who loves to be indoors.
Sealyham terriers have a very distinct look. These small dogs have a double coat that is either solid in colour or a solid colour with badger markings.
They have a medium-length coat that must be brushed at least three times weekly. You should also hand strip their coat a few times a year to get rid of dead hair, as it allows new hair to grow. Stripping the coat maintains its wiry texture, whereas the alternative is to clip the coat. Many pet owners choose this method, although it can make the hair soft and increases shedding.
Grooming Sealyham Terriers can be a long process on the days you need strip or clip them. You can always take them to a professional groomer to avoid this laborious part!
Trim their nails twice a month to avoid scratches and brush their tooth to prevent gum disease. It is always essential to check their ears, nose and eyes for debris build-up or signs of infections.
Sealyham Terriers, unfortunately, can be loud. They are vigilant dogs who are pretty wary of strangers and, because of their high prey instinct, will have the habit of barking at any small animal that passes by.
Seeing that they love to stay indoors, the incessant barking at smaller animals may only happen on your daily walk or when you let them outside. They also do not have a tiny voice to match their little body. They have a fierce bark which is problematic if you live in an apartment with easily annoyed neighbours.
If you want to ensure that your Sealyhams barking is under control, socialise and train them from an early age. Doing this will make them used to be in different environments, around other animals and people, and get them to understand and adhere to your commands.
The average weight of a male Sealyham is 9 kg while a female is 8 kilograms. Their average size is 30 centimetres.
This breed can be quite challenging to train. They are stubborn but highly intelligent, which makes a very tough combination. On the one hand, they will catch on quickly, and on the other hand, if the training method does not suit them, they will not participate.
They are known to guard their food, which needs to be worked on as this can lead to aggressive behaviour.
These dogs respond well to positive reinforcement techniques as, like most dogs, food rewards will always get them to do what you want them to do!
They need a firm and consistent owner who will take the time to work with this dog from a young age. Puppies need to be crate trained, socialised and given obedience training. Training should continue throughout your dog’s life.
This breed is commonly used in dog shows and sports, which requires particular training techniques. This can also be started as soon as possible, especially since they can be stubborn.
It is a pity that these affectionate dogs are not commonly used as companions. They make excellent pets who love to be around their family members.
As aforementioned, they are affectionately known as the “couch potato terriers” as they have a more relaxed demeanour compared to most terriers. They are highly intelligent hunting dogs, so expect some sass when reprimanding them.
As much as their stubbornness can override their personalities, the Sealyham Terrier’s temperament is overall quite friendly. They get along with other animals, children and even cats!
It is better to know that even the laidback Sealyham can get aggressive. Train them and socialise them as soon as possible to prevent this behaviour.
It is always best to familiarise yourself with the health problems that the breed you are considering to have in your home could be predisposed to.
Be sure to take your Sealyham to the vet for regular checkups. If you are considering purchasing a Sealyham puppy, ensure you get them from a reputable breeder. They will provide proof that your puppy and its parent were tested for sicknesses.
Here is a list of the most common health conditions for this breed:

The average life expectancy of Sealyham Terriers is 12 – 14 years.
These dogs need between 1 – 1 3/4 cups of high-quality dog food. This amount is based on the average size of this breed. A more active or slightly larger Sealy will need to be fed more food.
Consult your vet on the best options for Sealyham puppies, adults and senior dogs, to ensure that you are giving them the best choice throughout their life.
There is a lot to think about when it comes to price. As a purebred, this dog will most definitely be quite expensive to purchase. You would also have to consider the yearly expenses to sustain and maintain this dog.
That said, the purchase price from reputable breeders in Australia could cost you anywhere between $1,500 – $ 4,500.
Sealyham Terriers are not hypoallergenic. They can shed quite a bit, and with them being more indoor dogs, you will most definitely have dog hair all over your home!
Sealyham Terriers are friendly dogs but do tend to be aggressive. Their stubbornness and high prey drive can lead to unwanted behaviour in this breed.
These dogs need to be trained as early as possible and require the training to continue throughout their lives to maintain their good behaviour.
They are more likely to be aggressive towards other dogs or animals they do not know. These terriers are very good with cats and can be quite friendly towards them, especially if they are in the same household.
