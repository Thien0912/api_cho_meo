The Curly-Coated Retriever is one of the oldest retriever breeds, with origins traced back to the early 19th century in England. They were initially developed for hunting waterfowl and upland game, capitalizing on their exceptional swimming ability and soft mouth. These dogs were designed to be hard-working and diligent, allowing them to retrieve game in the harshest weather and roughest waters. In the 1880s, Curlies and Poodles were bred to create a tighter, low-shedding curly coat in the Curly-Coated Retriever, which is waterproof and thorn-resistant to help in thick bramble and cold waters. By the late 19th century, the Curly was exported as far as Australia and new Zealand.
Curly-Coated Retrievers can suffer from cataracts, color dilution alopecia, distichiasis, elbow dysplasia, entropion, exercise-induced collapse, follicular dysplasia, glycogen storage disease IIIa, hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, optic nerve colobomas, patellar luxation, persistent pupillary membranes, progressive retinal atrophy, progressive retinal atrophy (crd4/cord1), subaortic stenosis, and vitreous degeneration. Genetic testing is recommended, including for the following additional conditions: hyperuricosoria, degenerative myelopathy, and progressive rod-cone degeneration. As a deep-chested breed, Curly-Coated Retrievers are also susceptible to bloat, also known as gastric dilation volvulus (GDV). This is a life-threatening condition that can come on suddenly, so it‚Äôs important to know the warning signs and get an affected dog immediate veterinary care.
Curlies are known to be intelligent, trainable, and loyal dogs. They are typically more reserved than other retrievers, but still very friendly. They are usually calm indoors but outdoors, their natural retrieving instincts kick in, and they love to run, swim, and retrieve. They can be aloof with strangers but are generally good with children and other pets. Curlies typically mature more slowly in comparison to some other breeds, both physically and emotionally. They often maintain a playful, 'puppy-like' demeanor well into their older years.
The American Kennel Club (AKC) states that Curlies are among the oldest of the retriever breeds.The English Water Spaniel and the Retrieving Setter are two extinct dog breeds that are believed to be the first ancestors of the Curly. It is possible that that Curly is also descended from the Irish Water Spaniel.

The Curly-Coated Retriever, resembling to the Flat-Coated Retriever, is considered to be one of the oldest retriever breeds. Unfortunately, the exact origins and development story of the Curly-Coated Retriever is not exactly known.
Before dog shows were invented, became popular, and became the standard for evaluating dogs, the only thing that mattered was the dogs‚Äô working abilities. The only thing that is used to characterize a retriever breed is their ability to successfully retrieve prey on command while being irrespective of their color, size, or coat type. It is widely believed that the Curly-Coated Retriever is a direct descendant of the Irish Water Spaniel and the now extinct English Water Spaniel. Both of these breeds were originally bred for the purpose of retrieving upland waterfowl and birds in England. They both had very distinguishing curls, which provided them protection from the rough climatic conditions and form the vegetation. This curly, low-shedding coat type is thought to be a result of cross-breeding one of the retriever breeds with the Standard Poodle at some point in history. Poodles also contributed to the breed‚Äôs complex character and elegant carriage. What is certain is that by the middle of the 19th century, the Curly-Coated Retriever was already a very popular breed among the English hunting community. By 1860, both the Curly and the Flat-Coated Retrievers were recognized as distinct breeds.
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the breed got so popular, it was imported to all parts of the world, including the United States of America, and New Zealand. The dogs quickly became especially prized and popular as a gun dog, renowned for their excellent swimming talents, perseverance, courage, and their soft mouths, which delivered any waterfowl to the hunters without breaking their skin or damaging it at all. However, in spite of the breed‚Äôs immense popularity, the Curly-Coated Retriever‚Äôs population numbers have decreased drastically due to World War I., when dog breeding and hunting fell out of focus for many. Devastatingly, by 1919, only five Curly-Coated Retriever specimens were registered in the whole world. Between the two world wars, there was a glimpse of recovery for the breed, nonetheless, the dogs almost completely died out during World War II. Fortunately, people recognized the endless possibilities in the breed, and in 1924, a planned and observed breeding program had started organized by the AKC (American Kennel Club). This was also the year when the AKC recognized the breed within their ‚ÄòGun Dog‚Äô category. By the late 1960s, the Curly-Coated Retriever saw a resurgence in the United States of America, for the reason that many specimens were imported from England and New Zealand to the U.S. Later, in 1979, the Curly-Coated Retriever Club of America was founded with the objectives to popularize the breed, maintain their pureness and keeping their population numbers steady.
Despite the Curly-Coated Retriever‚Äôs initial popularity, today the breed has the smallest population of any retriever breed. However, the dogs are very versatile, as they are very intelligent, they are easy to train. Nowadays, there are still some specimens who are working along with hunters as classic retrievers, but most of the Curly-Coated Retrievers are kept simply as loyal, friendly, and active family companions.
