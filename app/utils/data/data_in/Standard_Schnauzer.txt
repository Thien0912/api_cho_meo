The Standard Schnauzer is a regal, medium-sized dog initially developed in and around Germany before it was formally known as Germany. They are a brilliant breed, well-known for their suitability to various living situations and companions.
These dogs have an aristocratic air about them that makes them appear almost dapper. They are squarely built, with wiry coats and hair that can be cut to suit a plethora of appearances and fashions. From their eyebrows to their bearded whiskers, they are easily recognizable worldwide, although they are most popular in Germany and the UK.

Schnauzers are often considered to be high-class dogs. They usually come with strong pedigrees and long lineages. They have not been largely bred as a working dog for many years in most regions of the world, setting them apart as a more expensive breed on the whole.
In the United States, Standard Schnauzers are more challenging to find, which increases their price exponentially. If you are looking for a show dog or one that comes from a highly reputable breeder or has a distinctive pedigree, the price tag will be even higher than usual.
In the UK, these dogs are somewhat easier to find, and there are many more breeders. Their price will usually be lower than what you would find in the US depending upon the breeder, their registration, and the pedigree.
When you adopt your pup, it is essential to ask to see their parent’s vet records and certifications. These should assure you of the puppy’s pedigree and lineage. The veterinary records also help identify potential health issues that your pup could inherit in the future. If you notice any of these on the papers, alert your vet for future appointments.

Standard Schnauzers have good pedigrees and often come with long lineages. They were theoretically bred as a cross between a Gray Wolf Spitz and then, years later, a black German Poodle. This mix developed the wire-haired stock of Pinscher that was similar to the Standard Schnauzers we have today.
This German breed is one of antiquity. We are not sure exactly when they were developed and firmly established as an independent breed. However, we have records of their existence due to their appearance in Rembrandt and Durer’s masterpieces. One even appeared in statue form by Mechlinburg in the 14th century. It was of a hunter who had a Schnauzer crouching at his feet.
Schnauzers were first developing in the neighboring kingdoms of the time, Bavaria and Württemberg. This association with the areas around Germany gave them a reputation for being a German breed.
They were also working dogs that were actively used in both of the World Wars. Some researchers believe that over 90% of the dogs that the Germans used to guard their carts, particularly farmers going to market, were of Schnauzer blood before World War I.
When they first came to America, they were classed in the Terrier group upon receiving recognition from the AKC. However, they were reclassed to a working breed years later to give credence to their working history.
The popularity and practical working nature of the Standard Schnauzer gave rise to the breeding of two other Schnauzers. The Miniature was first to be bred and followed the Standard Schnauzer to America. Even though the AKC first recognized the Schnauzer in 1904, a club wasn’t formed for them until 1925.
The club was split in 1933 with the arrival and recognition of the Miniature Schnauzer. There was one group known as the Standard Schnauzer Club of America and another known as the American Miniature Schnauzer Club.
Even though the Standard Schnauzer was known first, they never gained the kind of popularity in the United States that the Miniature quickly did. Currently, the Mini ranks as 12th in popularity in the AKC registrations. The Standard Schnauzer is below even the Giant, falling to 95th among the registered breeds.
Most dogs are not so well known for their haircuts and groomed styles as the Standard Schnauzer. Although they are widely recognized for their groomed beards and bushy eyebrows on a trim body, this is not their natural state. They are much more fluffy, and their fur can grow quite long if not maintained.
An owner of a Standard Schnauzer will need to shop around for a groomer accustomed to grooming this breed specifically. They need extra attention, and the styling has to be done carefully so the cut is maintained.
Since Schnauzers are hypoallergenic, they do not shed much, meaning that grooming and brushing need to happen more frequently than it typically would for other dog breeds.
Standard Schnauzers bring color into their owners’ life, and when you have one of them around, life won’t ever be dull. They are quite sociable creatures, particularly when it comes to other animals and humans they have previously met and feel comfortable around. They have never lost the desire to protect and defend the people whom they love. Having one of them around means having a companion that is always alert to make you feel protected.
These dogs are intelligent and high energy. They need owners who are willing to commit time to their physical and mental activity, or these dogs could become destructive. Schnauzers can also be quite stubborn if they are left to their own devices for too long.
These dogs are often an excellent choice for families. They generally behave well around children and can be tolerant of other dogs if they must.
Socializing Standard Schnauzers from an early age is important if you want a dog that is well-adjusted to meeting other animals and living as a dog that isn’t the only one in the home.
Standard Schnauzers need a high-quality diet that will provide them with plenty of protein and a reduced amount of additives. Feeding them properly can help with the quality of their coat and prolonged health.
A Standard Schnauzer should get between 2 and 3 cups of food each day. It is best to spread these out between two meals in a day to avoid indigestion.
Standard Schnauzers are medium- to high-energy dogs. They need to be taken out for daily walks and do things like hiking and more intensive activities. They should get about 60 minutes of activity each day. You can also take them to the dog park if you want to get them both exercise and socialization.
If you prefer to walk with your Standard Schnauzer, ensure that they go 8 miles each week. That way, you can feel assured that they are fit and healthy.
If you feel like you don’t have enough time to train them when they are young, put them into a puppy kindergarten class. It is imperative with this breed to start training early. Any habits and lessons that they learn when they are younger will be established firmly throughout the rest of their lives. The same goes for all of those lessons that they weren’t taught.
Grooming your Standard Schnauzer is an absolute must. Their grooming needs often begin to rack up costs because they need to be taken in between every 6 to 8 weeks. Letting it go for too long can mean an even tougher job when they go in or an absolute loss of the style that you were trying to maintain.
Other than taking them to the groomer, you will need to keep their nails clipped. If they get a great deal of outdoor exercise, they might wear down naturally. It is still a good practice to check them every three weeks, though.
Keep their teeth brushed by using a toothbrush on them at least once a week. It is best if you do it more often, though. Keep their ears cleaned out with a soft cloth.
Overall, the fact that this breed has lasted for so long and has a well-maintained heritage as a working breed means they are quite robust. Their health has stood the test of time, and they were never widely bred for physical characteristics that caused them pain or health problems as they got older.

Males often weigh slightly more than females in this breed. However, it can be difficult to tell because it varies from pup to pup. Whichever sex you get, it is important to spay or neuter you Schnauzer to prevent pregnancy and reduce the risk of certain types of cancers.

If you are looking for a sophisticated wing pup, these could be just the dogs for you. With their adorable bushy eyebrows and thick beards, they appear older than they are, even as young puppies. However, it is these features that make them so coveted as a pet.
If you live in the UK or Europe, you will have a better chance of adopting one of these dogs affordably than in the United States.

The Standard Schnauzer is a versatile and intelligent breed that originated in Germany over 400 years ago. They were initially bred to hunt small game such as rabbits and rodents.
These dogs are known for their distinctive beards and eyebrows, which give them a unique appearance. Their coats come in three main colors: salt and pepper, black, and white.
Standard Schnauzers are highly energetic dogs that require regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. They need at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day, such as walking or running.
The Standard Schnauzer is a breed that's known for its intelligence and energy level. They're warm and affectionate dogs, but they need regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom.
They have a high affection level and are great with kids, making them an excellent family pet. However, they can be wary of strangers and may require time to warm up to new people.
A Standard Schnauzer's intelligence is one of its most notable traits - they're often referred to as "the dog with the human brain." They're highly trainable and can learn new commands quickly, but they do need consistent leadership and training from an early age.
Here are some key characteristics of the Standard Schnauzer breed:
Standard Schnauzers are naturally protective of their family and territory, but they can be trained to be gentle and calm with proper socialization. They're also highly energetic and need regular exercise to stay happy and healthy.
Overall, the Standard Schnauzer is a loyal and loving breed that makes an excellent companion for active families or individuals.
The Standard Schnauzer has a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages when they were developed from herding, ratting, and guardian breeds in Western Europe.
They originated as a medium-sized dog used by peasant farmers for centuries, but it wasn't until the 19th century that they caught the attention of German dog fanciers who began standardizing their look and temperament for the show ring.
Their name "Schnauzer" comes from the German word for muzzle or snout, which suits them perfectly given their distinctive wiry beard. In fact, this feature became a defining characteristic of the breed as early as 1842 when they were still known as Wire-haired Pinschers.
The Standard Schnauzer was developed into three different breeds/sizes: Miniature, Standard (the original), and Giant, with the medium-sized schnauzer being the most popular. This size range makes them ideal for any activity, from taking goods to market to serving as a family companion.
Interestingly, the breed's reliability has been put to use in police work, bomb detection, and search and rescue work, including during World War I and II when they assisted the troops and worked with the Red Cross.

The Standard Schnauzer is a smart and sociable breed that requires regular interaction with their human companions. They crave attention and need to be engaged in activities that stimulate both their mind and body.
A daily routine of exercise, training sessions, and playtime will help tire out your Standard Schnauzer. This breed needs an outlet for their energy, but when properly exercised, they are neither hyperactive nor lethargic.
Regular grooming is essential for the Standard Schnauzer's characteristic double coat. Brushing with a bristle brush, pin brush, slicker brush, and comb will help prevent matting and keep the eyebrows, beard, and leg feathering free of debris.
Hand stripping or clipping are two methods to approach grooming your Standard Schnauzer. While clipping is more common in the US, hand stripping can be a better option for maintaining the breed's natural coat texture.

The Standard Schnauzer is a highly intelligent breed that needs plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. They require daily walks and playtime to keep them happy and healthy.
Their wiry double coat requires regular grooming to prevent mats and tangles. Brushing should happen every two to three days, and they only need one or two baths a month.
Standard Schnauzers are highly social dogs that thrive on interaction with their human companions. They crave attention and affection, so be prepared to spend quality time with them each day.
To keep their coat looking its best, you'll need to trim their nails every couple of weeks and brush their teeth every 2-3 days. Their ears should also be cleaned weekly to prevent infections.
A balanced diet is essential for the Standard Schnauzer's overall health. Feed them high-quality dog food and avoid overfeeding or giving too many treats, as this can lead to obesity and related health problems.
The Standard Schnauzer requires regular grooming to keep its characteristic double coat looking great. Brushing with a bristle brush, pin brush, slicker brush, and comb is essential to prevent mats from forming.
Grooming your Schnauzer regularly will also help keep its eyebrows, beard, and leg feathering free of debris. You should wipe your Schnauzer's beard frequently to reduce odors and discoloration.

Schnauzers are non-shedding dogs, but their hair grows continuously, making regular grooming a must. There are two ways to approach grooming: hand stripping or clipping.
Clipping with clippers reduces the wiry top layer of fur, changing its color and appearance. This method requires more frequent grooming, with clipping sessions every six to eight weeks.
To get your Standard Schnauzer used to regular grooming, it's essential to start early, including getting them accustomed to having their paws handled and being around scissors and clippers.
Twice a year, when most breeds are shedding their coat, the Schnauzer's coat will become dull and easy to pull out. This is known as 'blown', and it's an ideal time for stripping or pulling out the old coat by hand.
Alternatively, you can clip their fur with shears, but this results in a loss of texture and fullness. Clipped coats are more prone to tangling and knots, especially when long, and become duller in color.
Regardless of whether you choose to strip or clip your Schnauzer's coat, the 'furnishings' – longer hair on their legs and face – need regular scissoring or clipping and daily brushing to prevent painful mats.

The Standard Schnauzer can be a bit challenging with other pets due to their guard dog instincts and prey drive. They're naturally intolerant and potentially aggressive towards dogs, especially if they haven't been socialized properly.
Raising them with another pet from a young age is ideal for a harmonious household. This helps them develop good manners and reduces the likelihood of conflicts.
Their prey drive can send them off like a bullet after smaller animals, including cats. Proper introductions and supervision are crucial when introducing new pets to your Standard Schnauzer.
A socialized dog, however, can easily accept a new family member with proper introductions. With patience and consistency, you can teach your Standard Schnauzer to coexist peacefully with other pets in the household.

Standard schnauzers need at least an hour of exercise daily, which can be broken down into one long walk and several shorter outings.
A standard schnauzer's recall is excellent, but use caution when letting them off-leash, as they may stray far if not in a fenced area.
These dogs make great jogging partners and are up for a hike. They also enjoy canine competitions like agility, rally, and obedience.
Schnauzers need mental stimulation, which can be provided through puzzle toys, searching for toys around the house, or participating in barn hunting.
Balancing exercise with training is crucial to prevent destructive behaviors or territorialism. A responsible owner will find their schnauzer blossoms into a wonderful companion.
Teach your kids how to properly approach and touch your standard schnauzer, and supervise interactions to avoid accidental hurt.
With the right ratio of exercise, training, and mental stimulation, standard schnauzers become loyal companions that are always happy to curl up on the couch.

The Standard Schnauzer is generally a healthy breed with a long lifespan of 13-16 years or more.
One potential health concern is heart disease, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy, which can cause the heart to become large and weak.
Hip dysplasia is another common issue in Standard Schnauzers, where the femur head doesn't fit properly into the hip socket.

Eye problems are also prevalent, with many dogs suffering from dry eye or extra hairs growing inside their eyelids.
Some health issues can be identified through testing before breeding, such as hip and eye problems, which helps prevent future generations from inheriting these conditions.
Here are some common health concerns in Standard Schnauzers:
By choosing a responsible breeder who prioritizes health testing, you can find a Standard Schnauzer with significantly reduced risks of disorders.
The Standard Schnauzer is a relatively healthy breed with an average lifespan of 13-16 years.
Hip dysplasia and eye issues are the primary health concerns for this breed. Hip dysplasia can be tested for and identified in breeding stock before they pass it onto the next generation, but it's up to breeders whether they choose to do so.
The two major hereditary conditions within the breed are hip dysplasia and hereditary eye disease. Both problems can be tested for and identified in breeding stock before they pass the trait onto the next generation.
Some Standard Schnauzers may suffer from skin allergies, leading to excessive licking and scratching. This is often due to sensitive skin, which can cause discomfort for the dog.
Heart conditions, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy, are a common concern for Standard Schnauzers. This condition causes the heart to become large, thin, and weak.
Here are some of the health issues that may affect Standard Schnauzers:
Responsible breeders will test their breeding stock for hip and eye problems before breeding. They may also choose to health test their animals, but this is not always the case.
The cost of OFA testing for hip dysplasia can be relatively high (about $150-200 USD per dog per year). However, responsible buyers should only choose puppies from a litter where both parents have current OFA test certificates and scores of "excellent", "good", or "fair".
Standard Schnauzers can be a handful if not properly cared for. They require plenty of mental engagement to prevent boredom and destructive behavior.
Their independent nature means they need consistent guidance and training from an early age. This includes regular exercise and activities that challenge their minds, such as obedience training or agility sports.
If you're considering bringing a Standard Schnauzer into your life, be aware that they can become protective if not socialized well. This requires careful introduction to new people, animals, and environments to help them develop good manners.
Regular grooming sessions are also essential for this breed, which needs regular visits to the groomer to prevent matting and tangling of their distinctive coat.
Here's a quick rundown of some key cons to consider:
If you're up for the challenge, a Standard Schnauzer can be a loving and loyal companion. But it's essential to understand their needs and provide them with the care and attention they require.
Standard Schnauzers are working dogs at heart and their physique shows it - they're built for action! Males weigh between 35 to 50 pounds and stand around 18.5 to 19.5 inches tall, while females are slightly smaller, weighing 30 to 45 pounds and standing at 17.5 to 18.5 inches.
Some Standard Schnauzers can be quite small, even smaller than Miniature Schnauzers! It's not uncommon for a female Standard Schnauzer to be the same size as a Miniature Schnauzer.
At six months old, your Standard Schnauzer should be approaching their adult weight, but they still have some growing to do. Females typically weigh between 22.5 to 38.25 pounds and males between 26.25 to 42.5 pounds at this age.
For another approach, see: Are Miniature Schnauzers Good Dogs
Standard Schnauzers are distinguished by their long beards and eyebrows.
Their coats come in two main colors: pepper and salt, and less commonly black.
The hair coat on a Standard Schnauzer's body is stiff and wiry, similar to that of other wirehaired breeds.
This type of coat will perpetually grow in length without properly shedding.
At 4 months old, a Standard Schnauzer can weigh anywhere from 15 to 22.5 pounds for females and 17.5 to 25 pounds for males.
Their growth will slow down at this point, but it's not uncommon for puppies to have a growth spurt later on.
A unique perspective: German Shorthaired Pointer Weight Chart
Most dogs are close to their adult weight by six months old, with females weighing between 22.5 to 38.25 pounds and males weighing between 26.25 to 42.5 pounds.
However, predicting a dog's adult weight is typically pretty easy at four months of age, as smaller dogs tend to stay on the smaller side while larger dogs will probably stay large.
The average male Standard Schnauzer weighs 35 to 50 pounds and stands around 18.5 to 19.5 inches tall, while females weigh slightly less than 30 to 45 pounds and stand at around 17.5 to 18.5 inches.
It's worth noting that some female Standard Schnauzers are not much larger than Miniature Schnauzers, so don't expect your dog to be bigger than a Miniature Schnauzer, especially if they're a female.
Take a look at this: Bernese Mountain Dog 6 Months
If you're looking for a standard schnauzer puppy, expect to pay between $1,500 and $2,700 from a breeder.
Adopting a standard schnauzer can be a great way to start years of happy dog companionship. Check with shelters or rescue groups in your area, as well as regional and national rescue organizations that have been set up to help displaced schnauzers find a fresh start.

The Standard Schnauzer, also known as the Mittelschnauzer, is a versatile and intelligent breed that has captured the hearts of dog lovers worldwide. Originating from Germany, this breed was initially developed as a farm dog, guard dog, and companion. Recognized by both the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI), the Standard Schnauzer is a medium-sized dog with a distinctive appearance and a lively personality.
The Standard Schnauzer's history dates back to the 15th century in Germany, where it was primarily used as a farm dog. Its duties included herding livestock, guarding property, and even hunting vermin. The breed's name, "Schnauzer," is derived from the German word "Schnauze," meaning "snout," a nod to its distinctive facial hair.
Physical Characteristics:
The Standard Schnauzer's wiry coat and bushy eyebrows give it a unique, almost human-like expression. This breed is known for its robust build and alert demeanor, making it an excellent watchdog.
The Standard Schnauzer is a highly intelligent, energetic, and loyal breed. Known for its versatility, it excels in various roles, from a family companion to a working dog. Here are some key personality traits:
Minimum Daily: 45 minutes
Optimal: 60-90 minutes
Activities: Long walks, jogging, fetch, mental stimulation games
Standard Schnauzers are active dogs that require regular exercise to maintain their physical and mental well-being. A combination of physical activities and mental stimulation is ideal. Consider incorporating puzzle toys, obedience training, and agility exercises into their routine.
Shedding Level: Low to moderate shedding, more noticeable during seasonal changes
Grooming Needs: Moderate maintenance coat requiring regular brushing and professional grooming
Frequency: Brushing 2-3 times per week, bathing every 6-8 weeks
The Standard Schnauzer's wiry coat requires regular maintenance to keep it looking its best. Regular brushing helps prevent matting and removes loose hair. Professional grooming every 6-8 weeks is recommended to maintain the coat's texture and appearance. Pay special attention to their distinctive facial hair, which may require trimming.
Trainability: 4.5 out of 5
Standard Schnauzers are highly trainable due to their intelligence and eagerness to please. Positive reinforcement methods work best, as they respond well to praise and treats. Early socialization and obedience training are crucial to ensure they develop into well-rounded adults. Consistency and patience are key, as this breed can be independent at times.
Adaptability: 4 out of 5
Standard Schnauzers are adaptable dogs that can thrive in various living environments, from apartments to houses with yards. However, they do best in homes where they have ample space to move around and regular opportunities for exercise. They are not suited to a sedentary lifestyle and require an active owner who can meet their exercise needs.
Life Expectancy: 12-15 years
Common Health Issues: Hip Dysplasia, Eye Issues
Like all breeds, Standard Schnauzers are prone to certain health conditions. Regular veterinary check-ups and a healthy diet can help mitigate some of these risks. Be aware of the following common health issues:
Initial Purchase: $1,000-$2,000
Monthly Expenses: $80-$200
Owning a Standard Schnauzer comes with various costs, including the initial purchase price, food, grooming, veterinary care, and training. Be prepared for these expenses to ensure your dog receives the best possible care.
In conclusion, the Standard Schnauzer is a loyal, intelligent, and energetic breed that makes an excellent companion for the right owner. With proper care, training, and socialization, this breed can bring joy and companionship to your life for many years.
