The history of Saint Bernards stretches back as far as 1050 CE (AD) but they got their name when this breed began assisting hospice monks in finding lost or stranded Alpine mountaineers some 600 years later. They operated from a hospice built by the monk Saint Bernard of Menthon and they are believed to have saved as many as 100 lives.
Remarkably, the dogs would learn their rescue skills from older Saint Bernards and didn’t require human-led training. They also proved vital in carrying supplies to troops in the Italian mountains during World War I.
Famed for their big size and even larger hearts, Saint Bernards are prized pups. That makes it all the more sad that they don’t tend to live beyond 10 years but owners of this breed nevertheless relish every day and week they spent with them.
Akin to giant teddy bears, they’ll be there for you when you need to snuggle and they’ll offer support at the appropriate times. But there are some downsides to owning this large dog breed, which we’ll come to later in this guide.
Given their giant size, Saint Bernards are not very energetic and they only need a moderate amount of exercise.
“This should be up to 60 minutes per day, which can be taken as one long steady walk or two shorter walks,” says expert vet Dr Rebecca MacMillian.
In any case, don’t over-do things.

“Saint Bernards shouldn’t be over-exerted, and care needs to be taken in warm weather,” Dr MacMillan adds. “Their large size and thick coats mean they are at increased risk of heatstroke.”
Even so, it’s a good idea to include a gentle play session that will help to mentally stimulate this breed but the rest of the time can be spent relaxing which is something Saint Bernards will enthusiastically embrace – they’re not considered to be one of the calmest dog breeds for nothing. Fellow couch potatoes rejoice.
Saint Bernards learn quickly and you don’t need to spent ages each day on their training – usually about 15 minutes each day will suffice. But you do need to start early to ensure bad habits don’t sneak in and you also need to reinforce your lessons throughout their lives otherwise you could run into a bit of trouble.
“Training requires a consistent and positive approach,” says Dr MacMillan. “Saint Bernards are an intelligent breed and they are usually eager to please, though some dogs do have an independent streak. Their large size means you need to start training early as you definitely don’t want an unruly 200-pound dog jumping up and pulling you on the leash!”
Crate training is worth considering although you’ll need a large one! If left alone for too long, Saint Bernards can develop separation anxiety and this can lead them to bark, become destructive and even seek ways to escape. It’s best not to leave a Saint Bernards alone for hours but learning how to crate train a dog or at least considering alternatives to crate training could help.
You will be hard pushed to find a dog as soft and cuddly as a Saint Bernard and there’s a reason why they are referred to as gentle giants. So long as have been socialized early and have grown to become confident adults, you will find them to be docile yet playful pets who are at once inquisitive, charming and wonderful with children. Still, there is a caveat.
“In my experience, Saint Bernards can make wonderful family dogs but their large size means they can be a bit clumsy around young children,” says Dr MacMillan. And while they are in no way dangerous dogs, they can still be imposing and a little scary for some – although there are distinct family benefits to be had from that.
“These dogs are not known for their aggression and are typically very affectionate, but their size and deep bark will certainly put off many would-be intruders,” Dr MacMillan says.

You may need to invest in one of the best vacuum cleaners for pet hair if you bring a Saint Bernard home and that’s because they shed. A lot.
“Both long and short-coated varieties have a thick undercoat and shed heavily,” Dr MacMillan affirms so they’ll need brushing at least three times a week to keep on top of the loose hair. It’s also worth taking them to be professionally groomed three or four times a year.
“All of this hair and slobber can put off many potential owners,” Dr MacMillan says. You also need to make sure their skin folds and ears and regularly cleaned. Low-maintenance dog breed, they’re not.
Saint Bernards commonly present for problems with their eyes, according to Dr MacMillan.
Large, deep-chested dogs like the Saint Bernard are also at increased risk of gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV).
“The dog’s stomach bloats and becomes twisted on itself which can be fatal. Affected dogs need immediate veterinary help.”
What’s more, Saint Bernards are also prone to hip dysplasia, where the hip joint doesn’t develop correctly.
“The ball and socket don’t fit together smoothly, which causes painful lameness and the early onset of osteoarthritis,” says MacMillan. “It is essential to choose a puppy from a reputable breeder who has had their dog screened for this condition before mating them.”
You’d also seek a Saint Bernard if you wanted a therapy dog or if you have children and other pets – their emotional intelligence coupled with a level-head makes them a true asset in both regards.
You may want to steer clear if you’re after a high-energy dog to fit your lifestyle or if you live in a cramped apartment, though. House-proud pet parents may also want to look away.

The Saint Bernard breed is a majestic and beloved dog with a fascinating history and unique characteristics. From their ancient roots to their physical traits, from their personality to their health, there is much to explore and appreciate about these gentle giants.
The origins of the Saint Bernard breed can be traced back to ancient times. While the exact lineage is debated, it is believed that these dogs have roots in the Molosser dogs brought to Switzerland by the Romans. These Molosser dogs eventually interbred with local Swiss mountain dogs, resulting in the distinctive Saint Bernard we know today.
The ancient roots of the Saint Bernard breed can be witnessed in their impressive size and strength. These dogs were primarily used by Swiss monks and farmers for various tasks, including herding livestock and guarding properties. In addition, their keen sense of smell and tracking abilities made them invaluable in search and rescue operations.
The Saint Bernard’s ancestors, the Molosser dogs, were renowned for their strength and power. These dogs were often used in ancient warfare, as their imposing presence alone was enough to intimidate enemies. Over time, as the Molosser dogs were introduced to the Swiss Alps, they adapted to the harsh mountainous terrain and developed the physical characteristics that are now synonymous with the Saint Bernard breed.
The Swiss monks recognized the potential of these dogs and began selectively breeding them for their desired traits. They wanted a dog that could withstand the harsh alpine conditions, navigate treacherous terrains, and have the strength to rescue lost or injured travelers. Through careful breeding practices, the monks were able to refine the breed and create the Saint Bernard we know today.
The Saint Bernard breed owes its name to the Great Saint Bernard Pass, a treacherous route through the Swiss Alps. At the Great Saint Bernard Pass, the Hospice of Saint Bernard was established by St. Bernard of Menthon in the 11th century. The hospice became a sanctuary for travelers and pilgrims, and it was here that the breed was bred and trained for their legendary search and rescue missions in the harsh alpine conditions.
The monks of the Hospice of Saint Bernard recognized the unique abilities of the dogs and began using them in search and rescue operations. These dogs were trained to locate lost or injured travelers in the vast expanse of the Swiss Alps, often in blizzard-like conditions. Their keen sense of smell, combined with their strength and endurance, made them ideal for these life-saving missions.
The Saint Bernards were trained to carry small barrels of brandy around their necks, which served a dual purpose. Not only did the brandy provide warmth and comfort to the rescued individuals, but the barrels themselves acted as a beacon in the snow-covered landscape, making it easier for search parties to locate the stranded travelers.
The breed’s reputation for rescuing lost travelers quickly spread, and they became known as “Saint Bernards” after the hospice where they were bred and trained. Their heroic acts were celebrated, and the breed gained international recognition for their life-saving abilities.
Today, the Saint Bernard breed continues to be cherished for their gentle and friendly nature, as well as their impressive size and strength. While their search and rescue duties have diminished over time, their legacy as heroes of the Swiss Alps lives on.
The Saint Bernard breed is instantly recognizable due to its impressive physical characteristics. These gentle giants have captivated the hearts of dog lovers worldwide with their unique features.
Let’s delve deeper into the physical attributes that make Saint Bernards stand out from the crowd.
One of the most notable features of Saint Bernards is their sheer size and weight. These dogs are giant in stature, making them a sight to behold. Males stand at an average height of 27 to 30 inches at the shoulder, towering over most other breeds. Their weight ranges between 140 to 180 pounds, making them some of the heaviest dogs around. Females, although slightly smaller, still command attention with their substantial size.
Their massive build is not just for show. Saint Bernards were originally bred for rescue work in the treacherous Swiss Alps, where their size and strength were essential for pulling sleds and locating lost travelers. Their impressive stature continues to serve them well in various working roles and as beloved family pets.
Saint Bernards have a dense and weather-resistant double coat that keeps them warm in cold mountain climates. This thick fur not only provides insulation but also protects them from the elements during their mountainous expeditions.
Their coat comes in two varieties: short-haired and long-haired. The short-haired Saint Bernards have a sleek and smooth coat that requires minimal grooming. On the other hand, the long-haired variety boasts a luxuriously fluffy coat that demands more attention in terms of brushing and maintenance.
When it comes to colors, Saint Bernards exhibit a range of stunning combinations. The classic coat pattern features a white base coat with patches of reddish-brown, known as “brindle.” This distinctive coloration adds to their charm and sets them apart from other breeds. Additionally, some Saint Bernards sport a rich mahogany color with white markings, creating a striking contrast that accentuates their regal appearance.
Whether short-haired or long-haired, brindle or mahogany, Saint Bernards are undeniably captivating in their unique coat colors and patterns.
In conclusion, the physical characteristics of Saint Bernards are truly remarkable. From their towering size and weight to their dense and weather-resistant coats, these gentle giants possess a distinct allure that is hard to resist. Whether you encounter them on a snowy mountain or in the comfort of a loving home, Saint Bernards are sure to leave a lasting impression.
Beyond their impressive physical appearance, Saint Bernards are renowned for their gentle and friendly disposition.
Saint Bernards are known for their kind and patient nature, especially around humans. They are very affectionate and make excellent family pets. Their calm and tolerant demeanor makes them great companions for children, although their size can be overwhelming for very young children.
While Saint Bernards generally get along well with other animals, early socialization and training are important. Like any breed, individual personalities can vary, and proper introductions are necessary to ensure harmony in multi-pet households.
Saint Bernards, like many large breeds, have their own specific health concerns to be aware of.
One of the most common health issues seen in Saint Bernards is hip and elbow dysplasia, a condition where the joints do not develop correctly, leading to pain and mobility problems. They are also prone to bloat, a potentially life-threatening condition where the stomach twists. Other health concerns include heart conditions, eye disorders, and skin allergies.
The average lifespan of a Saint Bernard is around 8 to 10 years, although some may live longer with proper care. Factors such as genetics, diet, exercise, and overall health management play a crucial role in determining an individual dog’s lifespan.
Taking care of a Saint Bernard requires dedication and understanding of their specific needs.
Proper nutrition is vital for the health and well-being of a Saint Bernard. Due to their size and growth rate, it is important to provide them with a balanced diet that supports their bone and joint development without causing rapid weight gain. Regular veterinary check-ups can help ensure their nutritional needs are met.
While Saint Bernards are not hyperactive dogs, they still require regular exercise to stay healthy and prevent obesity. Daily walks and playtime in a secure area are essential. Training should start early with positive reinforcement methods, as these dogs can become strong-willed if not properly trained and socialized.
As you can see, the history and characteristics of the Saint Bernard breed are both fascinating and endearing. From their ancient origins and the role they played in the Swiss Alps to their gentle and affectionate temperament, these gentle giants have captured the hearts of dog lovers worldwide. Despite their size, they bring warmth and devotion to any family lucky enough to have them as companions.
