The American Staffordshire Terrier is a cousin of the Pit Bull Terrier. They were created by breeding old terriers such as the English Smooth Terrier, White English Terrier, and/or the Black-and-Tan Terrier with an old variety of Bulldogs.

The American Staffordshire Terrier, often affectionately referred to as Amstaff, is a breed of dog that has its origins in the Staffordshire region of England. The breed was initially developed in the 19th century for bull baiting, ratting, and later for dog fighting due to its courage, tenacity, and muscular build. In the mid-19th century, the breed was brought to the United States, where it was further refined and increased in size.
American Staffordshire Terriers are generally healthy and robust, though can suffer from skin allergies, hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, progressive retinal atrophy, cruciate ligament rupture, and cerebellar ataxia. Genetic testing for degenerative myelopathy, hyperuricosuria, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 4A, progressive retinal atrophy, and cone-rod dystrophy (types 1 and 2) can assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
American Staffordshire Terriers are known for their versatility. They are intelligent, confident, and good-natured. Despite their somewhat intimidating appearance, they are often gentle and affectionate with their families, including children. They can be protective, which can make them excellent watchdogs. However, due to their history, some may be aggressive towards other dogs if not socialized properly.While this breed requires an assertive owner who will provide strong leadership and socialization, they are eager to please and can be trained for a variety of tasks. Their physical strength and energy level mean they require regular exercise, and they may not be well-suited to apartment living unless they receive sufficient daily exercise.Despite their somewhat controversial history and reputation, with the right training, socialization, and care, American Staffordshire Terriers can make loyal, loving, and protective companions.
In 1903, an American Staffordshire Terrier named Bud went along for the ride on America's first cross country auto trip.An American Staffordshire Terrier named Sgt. Stubby became famous during World War I.

When you think of a terrier, you likely think of a small wiry-coated dog. However, the American Staffordshire Terrier, commonly known as an Amstaff, is the complete opposite of that. American Staffordshire Terriers are smooth-coated dogs with stocky, athletic frames. They are Bully Terriers, meaning they have Bulldog in their genetic history.

The origins of the American Staffordshire Terriers are somewhat tragic since they were bred for the cruel sport of bull-baiting in 18th-century England. As a result, the breed is muscular, powerful, and fearless.
In the modern era, the American Staffordshire Terrier has a much better lot in life. They are bred as family dogs, where they display their loving, friendly personalities. American Staffordshire Terriers love to cuddle and spend time with their families, so if you‚Äôre looking for a social and sweet-tempered companion, they may be perfect for you.

American Staffordshire Terrier puppies are affectionate, energetic pets. To prepare your household for a puppy, make sure you have plenty of toys. This will allow you to engage your American Staffordshire Terrier in play so they can burn off energy and also stimulate their mind.
You also need basic dog care items such as food and water dishes, a crate, a leash, and a collar. Ensure you have all of your necessities before bringing your puppy home so that you are prepared to provide the best possible care for your American Staffordshire Terrier.
American Staffordshire Terriers are sweet-natured dogs, but they can be prone to aggression without proper training and socialization. When your American Staffordshire Terrier is still young, you must help them explore new people, places, and situations so that they will be well-adjusted.
Likewise, ensure they receive proper obedience training. As long as your dog is trained and socialized during puppyhood, they will likely grow into a well-behaved adult.

The American Staffordshire Terrier is an intelligent breed and is generally a delight to train. While they may be occasionally stubborn, they are also clever and eager to please. They enjoy having a task to occupy themselves with, and without one, they may be prone to destructive behaviors.
They are vigilant and protective of their loved ones, which is why they may struggle with aggression issues if they lack adequate training and socialization. With their family members, the American Staffordshire Terrier is affectionate and cheerful.
They love being around their owners so much that they can be prone to separation anxiety. Again, this is a situation that can be managed or prevented entirely with a proper upbringing. Providing the American Staffordshire Terrier with activity, attention, and enrichment makes them much less likely to suffer from anxiety. Although they‚Äôre protective of their families, American Staffordshire Terriers aren‚Äôt very vocal.
Yes, the American Staffordshire Terrier can make a great family dog. They are patient and playful with children and enjoy their company. Still, it‚Äôs important that puppies are properly socialized, and all interactions between children and the American Staffordshire Terrier should be supervised to ensure no accidents happen.
When the American Staffordshire Terrier is well-socialized, they can get along with other pets. However, not all pets are appropriate roommates for the American Staffordshire Terrier.
They have a high prey drive, so smaller animals such as cats, rabbits, or hamsters may be seen as animals to chase and hunt. Early socialization can help the American Staffordshire Terrier understand that other pets should not be chased and are a part of the family.

The American Staffordshire Terrier can be a great candidate for a family pet due to their good-natured personality. However, that is not the only factor to consider when deciding which breed to bring home.
Responsible dog owners should also consider whether or not they can provide for the American Staffordshire Terrier‚Äôs care, including dietary requirements, exercise and training expectations, and grooming and healthcare needs.
Look for high-quality, AAFCO-certified dog food to ensure that your American Staffordshire Terrier receives the nutrition they need in their meals. Your dog‚Äôs food should have an animal protein source as the first ingredient.
Joint supplements may be worthwhile, as American Staffordshire Terriers tend to be prone to joint issues. You may also want to check your dog‚Äôs food for omega-3 fatty acids, which can also benefit the joints. They also nourish your dog‚Äôs skin and coat, helping their fur stay healthy and soft.
The American Staffordshire Terrier needs a lot of exercise to maintain their muscular, athletic physique. As an energetic terrier, around 60 minutes of daily activity should be enough to keep them fit. It is best to break up the 60 minutes into smaller sessions to keep your dog engaged and prevent them from wearing out. For example, a brisk 30-minute walk twice daily may be sufficient.
When exercising with an American Staffordshire Terrier, avoid vigorous activity directly after a meal. Exercising after eating could lead to gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), which is a serious and possibly fatal condition.
Although the American Staffordshire Terrier can be stubborn at times, they enjoy pleasing their owners. A dog owner who knows what they are doing and understands how to manage the American Staffordshire Terrier‚Äôs self-willed side can train them without much trouble. A good way to keep the American Staffordshire Terrier‚Äôs attention is to add active training into the mix, like agility training or playing fetch.
Positive reinforcement is essential to training the American Staffordshire Terrier. Harsh correction methods can backfire, damaging your dog‚Äôs trust in you and causing them to dislike training. On the other hand, praise and rewards for good behavior build your bond and make training a pleasant experience.
With their short, smooth coats, the American Staffordshire Terrier doesn‚Äôt require much brushing. Running a brush over their fur every week should be enough to keep it clean and sleek.
American Staffordshire Terriers can have sensitive skin, so keep that in mind when purchasing canine shampoos or other topical grooming products. Due to their delicate skin, the American Staffordshire Terrier should only be bathed every 4 to 6 weeks or as needed.
In addition to brushing their fur and keeping them clean, American Staffordshire Terrier owners should clip their nails, brush their teeth,¬† and check/clean their ears when necessary.
The American Staffordshire Terrier is a fairly healthy breed, but, like any dog breed, they are prone to some health conditions. As mentioned earlier, the American Staffordshire Terrier is at a higher risk of developing joint issues such as elbow dysplasia and hip dysplasia, so asking your vet about joint supplements and exercise regimes is a good idea.
When it comes to severe conditions, there are a few owners of the American Staffordshire Terrier should be aware of. Cerebellar ataxia is a hereditary condition that the breed is prone to, and it is a severe medical issue. It has no cure, and most afflicted dogs have to be put down. Signs of this condition may show up between the ages of 3 and 6 years.
Hypothyroidism occurs when a dog‚Äôs thyroid gland produces an inadequate amount of hormones, leading to metabolic issues. Thankfully, this issue can be managed, and afflicted American Staffordshire Terriers can live long happy lives.

The average size difference between the male and female American Staffordshire Terrier can be staggering. While the female weighs around 40‚Äì55 pounds, the male weighs around 55‚Äì70 pounds. Although the females‚Äô highest weight only lands at the males‚Äô lowest, their height differences are minimal.

While it is widely accepted that the American Staffordshire Terrier has Bulldog in their genetic background, the other breeds that make them up are a bit of a mixed bag. Bulldogs were crossed with various terrier breeds to create a muscular yet agile fighter. These dogs had to be cunning and aggressive against their adversaries while still being manageable or even friendly to humans.
The Staffordshire Terrier was brought from England to the United States of America in the mid-1800s. There, the development of the American Staffordshire Terrier began, and the two breeds became so different that the American Kennel Club eventually recognized them as separate dogs.
An American Staffordshire Terrier by the name of Sgt. Stubby helped soldiers in World War I. Throughout his life, he was admired by many in the nation, including three presidents.

The American Staffordshire Terrier is a confident, spirited canine with a heart of gold. Despite their tragic background, the breed has risen to a much more fortunate status in life, enjoying their days as beloved family pets.
If you think the American Staffordshire Terrier is the right fit for you, you can search for one at your local animal shelter or through a reputable, responsible breeder. Whichever way you choose to bring your American Staffordshire Terrier home, make sure you are prepared to meet their needs.
They require a lot of training, socialization, and exercise, but the results are well worth it. A well-cared-for American Staffordshire Terrier is a patient, friendly, doting companion that loves their family members above all else.

The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as the AmStaff, is a muscular, short-coated breed from the United States. The breed was developed in the 1800s when the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was brought to America and later bred as a larger version. In time, this breed was ultimately given distinction from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The American Staffordshire Terrier may be somewhat imposing in appearance, but they‚Äôre known for their loving temperament and are very affectionate with human family members, particularly children. They are also intelligent and eager to please, which makes them highly trainable. To that end, their intelligence means they need adequate mental stimulation. If they don‚Äôt get it, they‚Äôll put those strong jaws to use and chew anything out of boredom.
Socialization is also important to help the breed overcome their natural standoffish tendencies. This breed loves having a job to do, and they do well in athletic competitions, therapy work, and as a service animal. The American Staffordshire Terrier can be a loyal cuddle bug and family companion, as well as a competent working dog. If you‚Äôre thinking of bringing an American Staffordshire Terrier puppy home, be sure to check shelters first. Unfortunately, many American Staffy dogs and mixes are in desperate need of loving homes. You can very likely find one at a shelter near you.
If you decide to purchase an adult or American Staffy puppy, it‚Äôs crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable American Staffordshire Terrier breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn‚Äôt excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it‚Äôs worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you‚Äôll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup‚Äôs inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as ‚Äúsit‚Äù, ‚Äústay‚Äù, ‚Äúcome‚Äù, and ‚Äúleave it‚Äù. Barking-related training commands including ‚Äúhush‚Äù or ‚Äúquiet‚Äù are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog‚Äôs behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you‚Äôre away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as ‚Äúeasygoing,‚Äù ‚Äútolerant,‚Äù ‚Äúresilient,‚Äù or ‚Äúthick-skinned,‚Äù are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog‚Äôs sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being ‚Äúhighly-sensitive‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always only mean ‚Äúhighly anxious‚Äù. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive‚Äìbarking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It‚Äôs essential to remember that individual dogs‚Äô tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it‚Äôs essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you‚Äôre away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog‚Äôs natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it‚Äôs still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man‚Äôs best friend, and it‚Äôs no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family‚Äôs side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog‚Äôs affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner‚Äôs emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it‚Äôs a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family‚Äôs needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you‚Äôre looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blas√© attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren‚Äôt always so family-friendly.


It‚Äôs important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they‚Äôre not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It‚Äôs essential to consider the dog‚Äôs personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog‚Äôs reactions to children‚Äôs actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.


See Dogs Who Are Not Kid Friendly

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they‚Äôre love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It‚Äôs important to note that breed isn‚Äôt the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they‚Äôll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It‚Äôs may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy‚Äôs early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they‚Äôll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and¬†exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash¬†in public.


However, it‚Äôs worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It‚Äôs essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal ‚Äúblowouts‚Äù and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog‚Äôs coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog‚Äôs fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog‚Äôs skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you‚Äôre someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn‚Äôt prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as ‚Äúheavy droolers,‚Äù some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you‚Äôve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you‚Äôre not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog‚Äôs normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn‚Äôt very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don‚Äôt require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as¬†Pugs¬†and¬†Shar-Peis¬†have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the¬†Basset Hound¬†or¬†Cocker Spaniel¬†must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a¬†professional groomer¬†or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it‚Äôs important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it‚Äôs advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you‚Äôre interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup‚Äôs parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The¬†CHIC¬†(Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog‚Äôs test results. It doesn‚Äôt indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog‚Äôs age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren‚Äôt affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed‚Äôs parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it‚Äôs essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog‚Äôs diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet‚Äôs specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog‚Äôs weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet‚Äôs individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to ‚Äúsit,‚Äù easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It‚Äôs crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren‚Äôt necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it‚Äôs staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you‚Äôre trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to ‚Äúheel,‚Äù there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the¬†most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the¬†basics of leash training¬†for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It‚Äôs worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn‚Äôt always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or ‚Äúherd‚Äù their human family members. Of course, this isn‚Äôt always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It‚Äôs important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy‚Äôs development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren‚Äôt true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it‚Äôs a good idea to teach your dog commands like ‚Äúdrop it‚Äù or ‚Äúlet go‚Äù from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they‚Äôll start to use less pressure. It‚Äôs crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You‚Äôll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase ‚Äî and sometimes kill ‚Äî other animals. Anything whizzing by ‚Äî such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars ‚Äî can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you‚Äôll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren‚Äôt a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won‚Äôt chase, but you‚Äôll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog‚Äôs prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you‚Äôre considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you‚Äôre considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious ‚Äústrangers‚Äù put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it‚Äôs the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as ‚Äúquiet‚Äù or ‚Äúspeak.‚Äù Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog‚Äôs innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the ‚Äúescape artist‚Äù tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs‚Äô physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs‚Äô lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed‚Äôs energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog‚Äôs needs and the owner‚Äôs preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It‚Äôs also important to note that age doesn‚Äôt exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won‚Äôt be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it‚Äôs recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it‚Äôs advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog‚Äôs mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it‚Äôs pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a¬†dog‚Äôs behavior¬†as well. Dogs ‚Äî particularly¬†puppies¬†and young dogs ‚Äî have a lot of energy, and if they don‚Äôt get the chance to burn it off,¬†destructive behavior¬†is often the result. If you‚Äôre annoyed at your dog‚Äôs digging, have headaches from¬†barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a¬†leashed walk¬†around the block isn‚Äôt going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they‚Äôre slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog‚Äôs temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it‚Äôs essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you‚Äôre prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog‚Äôs individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It‚Äôs about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The American Staffordshire Terrier is a loving, loyal, playful dog that loves to spend time with human family members. They are quite muscular for their size, which can make them a handful on walks if they aren‚Äôt trained properly. They also have strong jaws, which they will use to chew out of boredom. Many a piece of furniture has been destroyed by an American Staffordshire Terrier that isn‚Äôt physically and mentally stimulated enough. However, a confident, firm trainer who can meet the physical demands of the breed without harsh punishment will be rewarded with a calm, obedient dog that is comfortable with nose work, agility exercises, and athletic competitions, as well as just snuggling up on the couch.
Although they are used as watchdogs, their natural love of humans makes the American Staffordshire Terrier‚Äôs guarding ability more based on intimidation than anything else. Their muscular build and reputation as aggressive dogs act as deterrents from intruders, though that reputation is mostly undeserved. The American Staffordshire Terrier shares much in common with the American Pit Bull Terrier. Both have been used in illegal dog fighting rings, which makes them the targets of Breed Specific Legislation that bans them. But when brought up in a home with love that gives them proper training and socialization, American Staffordshire Terriers are docile, affectionate animals that are very loyal and obedient.
Friendly and Affectionate: They are known for their friendly and affectionate nature, often forming strong bonds with their families.
Courageous and Confident: They possess a high level of confidence and courage, traits that were historically valued in their roles as working dogs.
Intelligence: American Staffordshire Terriers are intelligent and can excel in various dog sports and activities, provided they receive proper training and mental stimulation.
Playful: Despite their muscular appearance, they have a playful and fun-loving side, often enjoying games and playtime with their families.
Good with Children: When properly socialized, they can be excellent with children, often displaying patience and affection.
Protective Instincts: They have protective instincts, which make them effective watchdogs, always alert to potential threats.
Historical Roles: Originally bred for bull-baiting and later as farm and guard dogs, they have a rich historical background as working animals.
Sturdy and Low-Maintenance Coat: Their short coat is easy to maintain, requiring minimal grooming.
Positive Advocacy: American Staffordshire Terrier enthusiasts are often passionate about dispelling misconceptions surrounding the breed, advocating for responsible ownership.
The ancestors of the modern American Staffordshire Terrier hail from England and were a mix between Bulldogs and Terrier breeds. Their mixed heritage earned them many names, including Bull-And-Terrier Dog, Pit Bull Terrier, and Half and Half. Eventually, they came to be known as Staffordshire Bull Terriers. These dogs were used by butchers to manage bulls, hunters to bring down wild boars, and farmers to help with farm work and act as ratters and family companions because they were so affectionate to humans. Later, they were used in the barbaric sports of bull-baiting and bear-baiting due to their tenacity, courage, and muscular build. When these blood sports were eventually outlawed, they were used in dog fighting rings, which sadly continues in illegal events to this day. It is because of their misuse by humans that they carry their reputation as an aggressive breed. Around 1850, many of these dogs made their way to America. They started to become known as American Pit Bull Terriers, Pit Bull Terriers, American Bull Terriers, and Yankee Terriers.
Around the turn of the 20th century, they were recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) as American Pit Bull Terriers. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed as Staffordshire Terrier in 1936. In 1976, the AKC changed the name to American Staffordshire Terrier, as Americans had bred a larger dog than the original Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and these two breeds needed to be distinguished from one another more clearly. Some breeders, however, preferred the name of American Pit Bull Terrier from the UKC and kept it. Today, the American Staffordshire Terrier and the American Pit Bull Terrier still have much in common, though they have been bred separately for more than 50 years.
There are very few differences between the breeds, though American Staffordshire Terriers tend to be a bit larger than American Pit Bull Terriers and seem to have more docile personalities. American Staffordshire Terriers are now used as watchdogs, help with police work, and compete in weight pulling and agility competitions, as well as being family pets. They still have a bad reputation as aggressive dogs and are often included in Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) that bans them, and some insurance companies refuse to cover households that have them. Check your local laws and insurance policy before you decide to adopt an American Staffordshire Terrier and contact your legislators if you disagree with BSL.
Male American Staffordshire Terriers average about 17 to 19 inches in height, while females tend to be a bit smaller at an average of 16 to 18 inches in height. The average weight for an American Staffordshire Terrier is between 40 and 60 pounds, though some can weigh more or less.
The American Staffordshire Terrier is celebrated as a family dog that loves to be around humans. American Staffordshire Terriers are never happier than when they‚Äôre spending time with their families. Although they have a reputation as being guard dogs, they are likely to greet strangers with lots of licks and affection. It is mostly their muscular build and undeserved reputation as aggressive ‚ÄúPit Bulls‚Äù that intimidate intruders and keep them away. That said, many American Staffordshire Terrier owners claim that dogs of this breed are great judges of character and know people‚Äôs intent, and they can make excellent watchdogs for that reason.
American Staffordshire Terriers are intense dogs that will pull, chew, dig, and bark if they‚Äôre bored. As strong, athletic dogs, they can be difficult to walk, and they‚Äôll pull their walker wherever they go if they‚Äôre allowed to. They need a confident, assertive trainer who will be able to handle them on a leash, set boundaries, and give them proper mental and physical stimulation. They also require early socialization with humans and other animals. While the breed is naturally friendly to people, they can be confrontational with other dogs when they aren‚Äôt socialized. American Staffordshire Terriers are intelligent, eager to please, and generally take well to training. They enjoy having a job to do, whether that‚Äôs acting as a jogging buddy, doing nose work, running agility courses, or performing in other dog sports. A trainer who can meet the physical demands of the American Staffordshire Terrier and keep them busy and under control will have a devoted, affectionate, and obedient companion for life.
While American Staffordshire Terriers are generally robust dogs, owners need to be aware of potential health issues and work closely with veterinarians to ensure early detection and proper management when necessary. Health conditions to be aware of include:
Skin Allergies: American Staffordshire Terriers are prone to skin allergies, which can manifest as itching, rashes, or skin infections. These conditions may require ongoing management and treatment.
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): UTIs can occur in this breed, leading to discomfort and urinary issues. Regular monitoring and prompt treatment are important to address these infections.
Autoimmune Diseases: American Staffordshire Terriers are at risk of autoimmune diseases, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells. This can result in a range of symptoms and may require lifelong management.
Osteoarthritis: As they age, AmStaffs may develop osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness in the joints. It can affect their mobility and quality of life.
Spondylosis: Spondylosis is a condition characterized by the formation of bony growths along the spine‚Äôs vertebrae. It can lead to discomfort and mobility issues, especially in older dogs.
Hip Dysplasia and Elbow Dysplasia: These are hereditary conditions where the hip or elbow joint doesn‚Äôt develop correctly. They can lead to pain, lameness, and arthritis.
Demodectic Mange: This is a skin condition caused by mites, resulting in hair loss, itching, and skin irritation. It often requires veterinary treatment.
Cerebellar Ataxia: Cerebellar ataxia is a neurological disorder that can affect coordination and balance in dogs, leading to a lack of control over movements.
Heart Disease: American Staffordshire Terriers can be susceptible to heart diseases, which may include conditions like heart murmurs or cardiomyopathy. Regular cardiac check-ups are crucial.
Luxating Patella: Luxating patella is a condition where the kneecap dislocates from its normal position. It can cause pain and limping and may require surgical intervention.
American Staffordshire Terriers are known to get bad breath, so their teeth should be brushed at least weekly, preferably even more frequently, to prevent bad breath germs from growing. Their nails should be trimmed as needed, which can be difficult as American Staffordshire Terriers tend to not like to have their paws touched. Training them early to be comfortable with touching and grooming will help. Their ears should be checked for wax buildup and debris weekly and cleaned as needed to avoid ear infections or pest infestation. Keep up with regular veterinary checkups and follow your veterinarian‚Äôs advice for additional at-home care.
American Staffordshire Terriers should be given a diet formulated for a mid-to-large-size dog with moderate energy levels. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your American Staffordshire Terrier and what size portions they require. Their needs will change with age, so be sure to make adjustments from puppyhood to adulthood and old age as recommended.
The short, smooth coat of the American Staffordshire Terrier can come in a variety of colors, including blue, fawn, white, black, and red. They can include a mix of white and other colors or a mix of white and brindle. It is considered a fault by the AKC if more than 80 percent of the coat is white. The stiff, glossy hair of the American Staffordshire Terrier sheds heavily twice a year as the seasons change and sheds minimally the rest of the year. It should be brushed at least weekly, which will help capture some of the shedding fur and keep the coat shiny. Bathing is only necessary as needed, which shouldn‚Äôt be more than a few times a year unless dogs get dirty. Generally, this breed doesn‚Äôt have much of a ‚Äúdoggy odor‚Äù and can go without a bath for some time. Overall, American Staffordshire Terriers‚Äô grooming needs are fairly low.
American Staffordshire Terriers are known for being loving family dogs, even with children. That said, they are best suited to homes with kids over the age of six. This breed is very muscular and can play rough, which might result in injuries. Young kids like to poke and prod, so it is especially important to train them on how to handle animals. Even with properly trained dogs of any breed, playtime with children should always be supervised. American Staffordshire Terriers are not generally fond of other dogs. They were originally bred to fight, and though many breeders have worked to remove these tendencies over the years, the breed can still be standoffish. Meeting other dogs in public can be a hit-or-miss situation with each dog. Additionally, American Staffordshire Terriers may see other pets like cats as prey. Early socialization and growing up with other animals can reduce the American Staffordshire Terrier‚Äôs tendencies to not get along well with other pets, but they may be best suited to one-pet households.
If you‚Äôre interested in an American Staffordshire Terrier, you should check out rescues near you that specialize in Pit Bull breeds. One such organization is Save-A-Bull Rescue, a non-profit organization that focuses on finding homes for Pit Bull breeds, including the American Staffordshire Terrier.
Finding a reputable dog breeder¬†is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems, and they may not socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.

The American Staffordshire terrier‚Äôs history can be traced back to the 19th century, originating in England. Sadly the bulldogs and terriers of the time were started to get crossed in order to create fighting dogs although dogfighting was outlawed in the United Kingdom as early as 1835, it continued to flourish as the ban was difficult to enforce. The aim was to create animals that possessed the agile and energetic characteristics of a terrier and also the perseverance and confidence of a bulldog.
In the case of bull-type terrier breeds, all can agree that the common component in their makeup was the Bulldog although its appearance and characteristics widely differed from the one we know today, it was a much ferocious creature back then. The disagreement begins with the terrier part. There is a lot of argument between experts about which pre-existing terrier breeds resides in the Staffordshire‚Äôs genetic background. Some claim it was the white English Terrier or the Black-and-Tan Terrier, that was used as a cross with the Bulldog to perfect the Staffordshire Terrier. Others suggest that game terrier, for example, the Fox Terriers were used due to their gameness, which is useful in fights, so it is rational to conclude that the breeder's intentions were to perfect the bloodline with this characteristic. Anyways, it was the cross between the Bulldog and terriers that resulted in the Staffordshire Terrier. The bull-and-terrier dogs came to the United States towards the end of the ¬†1800s ¬†where they became known as pit bull terriers and then American bull terriers. Eventually, after its arrival to the US, the local breeders developed a ¬†version of the Staffordshire Terrier which was larger than the English one. Now they are recognized by the AKC and most major international Kennel Clubs as two distinct breeds: the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier.
