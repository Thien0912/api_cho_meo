Can your ridgeback get along well with a cat? This is a surprisingly common question I get a lot. It’s true that certain breeds are better suited to our feline friends, so how do ridgebacks hold up?
Rhodesian ridgebacks are not a breed that naturally gets on well with cats. The two could potentially live together if they were raised together, but under any other circumstances, they would likely struggle to get on well. Extreme caution should be taken.
For your ridgeback and cat to develop a respectful and friendly relationship, we are limited to the following two scenarios:
● When your ridgeback and cat were both raised together from being a puppy and kitten● If you have an existing adult cat and you get a puppy ridgeback
These are the two only scenarios when your ridgeback and cat could develop somewhat of a trusting relationship with each other. And even still, a lot of caution/supervision is required from the beginning.
There have been some owners who have successfully brought in a cat to the household at a later date with an existing adult ridgeback. But this is far and few between and could have taken years of supervision and careful training. The risk is very high in this situation.
So why is this relationship hard to develop? Two words, prey drive.
Rhodesian ridgebacks have a strong instinctual prey drive that has been developed for hundreds of years (if not longer) while hunting and guarding in wild southern Africa.
It’s literally in their DNA to seek, chase, grab and sometimes even kill wild game. This is known as the universal predation sequence. Instinctual behaviors like this are technically impossible to train against and can never be fully “removed” from your ridgeback.
Now, this isn’t to say that all ridgebacks would always try to kill a cat, but due to the cat’s quick sudden movements, smaller physical size, and different smell, this would at least trigger your ridgeback to automatically start chasing.
Once a chase commences, everything becomes instinctual and there’s no telling how far any ridgeback would go (if he were to catch the cat). Regardless of how “nice and cute” your Rhody is while receiving belly rubs, in wild animalistic moments like this, anything can happen.
This is why Rhodesian ridgebacks are not naturally suited to cats.

As I mentioned in the first section, there are two scenarios when this unlikely relationship can actually work.
If you were to raise a puppy ridgeback with a kitten or an existing adult cat, then the puppy will have enough time around the cat from birth, to know that the cat is of equal or higher status than they are (in the pack). And this is essential to stop him from trying to chase/grab/kill the cat.
Ridgebacks, just like most working dogs, are pack animals and rely heavily on a clear hierarchal structure to know their place in the family.
In fact, the only reason your ridgeback listens to you is that you are at the top of the pack.
In order for a harmonious relationship between the ridgeback and cat, the ridgeback must view the cat as equal or preferably higher in status than he is. By raising the two together, this is almost automatically achieved, as the puppy (before they are a physical threat) will learn to view the cat as a sibling, rather than prey.
⭐ You can also manufacture this kind of hierarchal system by the following:
● Showing affection to your cat in front of your ridgeback● Allowing your cat to eat her food first (the order of who eats is very important in wild hierarchal systems)● Allowing your cat to be physically higher than your ridgeback● Giving treats to your cat first before giving them to your ridgeback
These four things can show your ridgeback that the cat is a valued and well-respected member of the pack.
This isn’t to make your ridgeback feel bad, it’s to establish a solid hierarchy within the home. This is vital, because, at the end of the day, your ridgeback could physically kill your cat, but not the other way around. So he must absolutely respect the cat, like a sibling, or higher.

Getting a cat, when you have an existing adult ridgeback at home, is not recommended. Although I’m sure there have been a few successful owners. The risks are extremely high.
Due to your ridgeback’s existing place in the home, any other animal would be considered a threat, and that’s because dogs, especially ridgebacks are territorial animals.
Trying to establish your cat’s place in the home, would prove to be extremely difficult.
Your ridgeback will be a constant threat to your cat and you won’t be able to leave the two without supervision.
You could expect the same response from your ridgeback as you do when he spots a cat outside while on walks (chaos).
In some circumstances, a Rhodesian ridgeback could live with a cat. If the two were raised together, or you got your puppy ridgeback after you have an existing cat, with careful training and supervision the two could get along.
Other than that, this relationship is not destined to work out well, and extreme caution should always be taken when your ridgeback gets near a cat.

A strong and protective breed, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a great family pet. Playful and sometimes rough, he’s best with older children. Athletic and in need of space, he does best living in a home with a large and spacious fenced-in yard. In need of exercise, he must be walked and jogged daily. If not given proper leadership from his master, he may become mischievous and begin to rebel. Best with cats when raised with them, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a natural hunter. An excellent jogging and hiking companion, this pup is extremely loyal and loving.

Waking up in the bed of his owner, he’s ready for his morning jog. Back at the home, he’ll eat breakfast with the family prior to taking a run in the backyard. After ensuring that all is well and in its place, he’ll head back inside for playtime with the kiddos. A snooze on the couch and he’ll be up for any type of love that you can give him. After a hike later in the day, he’ll be happy to watch TV while snuggled on the couch with the family.

Learn more about this intelligent, friendly yet incredibly active dog and whether you should invite a Rhodesian Ridgeback into your home

Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years
Size: 25-27 -inches (male); 24-26 inches (female);
Coat: Short, dense and glossy
Temperament: Sensitive, intelligent, loyal, protective and strong-willed
Exercise needs: One to two hours
Origin/native country: Southern Africa
A breed of African lion hound originating from South Africa and Zimbabwe in the 1600s, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a cross between the European breeds of Dutch colonizers and the ridge-backed native hunting dogs of the Khoikhoi people.
As you can probably gather, this is how they got their name (Rhodesia was the colonial name for the independent country now known as Zimbabwe) and they’ve since become popular pets and guard dogs. They’re distinguished by a ridge of hair running along the back some two inches wide.
But are Rhodesian Ridgebacks the breed for you? Large and a little intimidating, they may not always seem ideal additions to the home but they actually have many surprising qualities. So let’s take a closer look at this hound breed and whether you’ll be a good match.
Rhodesian Ridgebacks are a very high-energy dog breed and they need to be kept significantly active every day otherwise they will become bored and destructive.
“These dogs were originally bred as hunting dogs in Southern Africa, so they are active and built for strength and endurance,” says expert vet Dr Rebecca MacMillan. “They will need between one and two hours of play and exercise each day.”
This generally includes taking them for long walks and runs rather than a gentle stroll. As such, they fare better with active owners who have a lot of time on their hands. They are also best suited to homes that have a large, securely fenced yard or at least a sizable, safe patch of land on which they’re allowed to run free and satiate their desire for both mental and physical stimulation.
Since Rhodesian Ridgebacks have a great sense of smell, you should play scent games with them, which can be as simple as hiding treats around the house or yard.

Since they are very intelligent dogs, you will find Rhodesian Ridgebacks are not only relatively easy to train but are actually among the big dog breeds that make sensible pets. That said, you do need to have some experience of owning a dog because there are some challenges.
“Ridgebacks are smart, but they are also independent, meaning that training can be tricky for novice owners,” says Dr MacMillan. “They can come across as stubborn and strong-willed, so consistent positive reinforcement training is essential.”
Training is certainly important. Rhodesian Ridgebacks have natural guardian instincts which mean they need to learn how to engage appropriately with strangers. They also have strong prey drives so it’s best to train them in areas free of distractions and then work on taming that urge to chase.
Crate training should be considered as a way of dealing with separation anxiety because Rhodesian Ridgebacks don’t like being left alone all day.
As gregarious and gentle dogs, Rhodesian Ridgebacks are protective of their families, which is why they are among the best guard dog breeds. But this can cause a problem.
“They can be a bit wary or reserved when first meeting strangers which is why appropriate training and early socialization is so important,” says Dr MacMillan.
Even so, they tend to be calm within the home.
“Their large size can make them seem intimidating, but these dogs will make gentle and loyal pets with the right care,” Dr MacMillan adds. You may, however, want to avoid introducing them into a home with very young children simply because this breed’s size could potentially cause injuries should they collide.
“They can be good with children, but they are very strong and large, so supervision is always required,” Dr MacMillan says.

You will find Rhodesian Ridgebacks are rather low maintenance dogs.
“They have short and easy-to-care-for coats and they are considered low shedders, so they shed less than some other breeds of dog,” Dr MacMillan says. In general, you’ll only need to give them a once over each week with one of the best dog brushes and that will remove any loose hairs.
Keep the nails in trim, preferably using one of the best nail grinders for pets because it can be a stressful experience for Ridgebacks and give them the occasional bath.
Rhodesian Ridgebacks are pedigree dogs so they are at risk from hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia.
“These are hereditary joint problems that can affect the development of your dog’s limbs. If the joint doesn’t fit together smoothly then painful lameness can occur and early onset osteoarthritis,” says Dr MacMillan.
Dermoid sinuses can also be present at birth in some Rhodesian Ridgebacks.
“This neural tube defect is caused by incomplete separation of the skin and nervous system during development in the womb,” Dr MacMillan explains. “This often painful condition is commonly found on the neck or upper spine. It is a congenital condition, meaning that affected parents can pass the problem on to their offspring. Dermoid sinuses are thought to be linked to the same genes that give these dogs the characteristic ridge on their backs.”
Finally, hypothyroidism is also very common in Rhodesian Ridgebacks.
“This is a condition that can lead to weight gain, lethargy, hair thinning, and infertility,” Dr MacMillan says.
Rhodesian Ridgebacks are wonderful, loyal dogs who adapt well to human family life. They infrequently bark, love to play and, if you’re an active household, you’re going to rub along extremely well – while ensuring this breed remains sufficiently stimulated and less prone to boredom and destruction.
If you’re time-poor, however, and you tend to spend the majority of your days outside of the home, away from pets, then you will run into problems. It’s also important to devote a lot of time to training.
