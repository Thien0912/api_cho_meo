The Norwegian Elkhound is alert, bold, loyal and friendly. Although some may be somewhat reserved with strangers, it will greet family and friends it knows with enthusiasm. Docile, trustworthy and energetic, they are good child companions. Like other Arctic dogs, the Norwegian Elkhound has a mind of its own and is fairly independent, however it is affectionate with its family. They have an outstanding character, and are relatively clean compared to some other breeds. Can be somewhat difficult to obedience train. It is important to be firm with this dog, showing good pack leadership.  They need firm, but gentle discipline. A natural watch and guard dog. This breed likes to roam and bark. They were bred to be hunters who hold their prey at bay, barking at it constantly until the hunter arrives. If their barking becomes obsessive they must be taught enough is enough after they alert you once, it's time to quiet down. Be fair when training this breed, and understand it is a canine, not a human and treat the dog accordingly. If they are not 100% sure of their follower place in the world they can develop a tendency to fight with other dogs. Elkhounds are hunters and should not be trusted alone with small non-canine pets such as hamsters, pet rats, mice or guinea pigs, however some have been known to get along with them when the owners worked at communicating to the dog that the small pet was alpha over them. They can get along with cats of the family. Without enough mental and/or physical exercise they can become high strung. Be sure to make the dog heel when on a walk beside or behind you, never in front, to reinforce the human is alpha over the dog; pack leader goes first.

The hard, coarse, weatherproof coat is easy to groom. It should be brushed regularly, with extra care given while the dog is shedding its dense undercoat. When the dog is shedding, the dead hair clings to the new hair. The dead hair should be removed with a rubber brush or a wooden comb with a double row of metal teeth. Brushes and combs just for this purpose are sold in pet stores. Bathe only when necessary, as it removes the natural oils in the skin. Like other Arctic dogs, they do not have the usual smell of dog hair. The coat is both water and dirt resistant. This breed is a seasonally heavy shedder.
The Norwegian Elkhound originated in Scandinavia and is one of the most ancient breeds; it is thousands of years old and has been around since the Stone Age. A skeleton similar to today's Norwegian Elkhound dating from 4000 to 5000 BC has been found. To put some perspective on it, these dogs have been around since man hunted with slingshots and lived in caves. They worked as a hunting and guard dog for the Vikings. The dogs were used as big and small game hunters tracking animals such as moose, elk, bear, mountain lion, badger, lynx, wolf, reindeer and rabbit. The dogs would track the quarry and alert the hunter by barking, holding the animal at bay until the hunter arrived. Norwegian Elkhounds can smell game from over a mile away. The dogs tended to work better at night than in the daytime. The breed is also highly prized as a sled dog. In case of war, the Norwegian Defense Minister has the power to mobilize all privately owned Elkhounds. In more recent times, the friendly and reliable character of the Elkhound has helped win a place in many homes as a cherished family pet. The name "Elkhound" is a direct translation from its original Norwegian name "Elghund," meaning "moose dog." In Norwegian, "elg" means "moose" and "hund" means "dog." The breed was first exhibited in 1877 when the Norwegian Hunters Association began holding shows. The AKC first recognized the breed in 1913. In 1923, the Elkhound Club was formed and the breed was officially recognized by the British Kennel Club. Some of the Elkhound's talents include: hunting, tracking, herding, watchdog, guarding, sledding and agility. There is also a Black Norwegian Elkhound that is recognized as a separate breed, but is almost identical in type except for color.

"Tia the Norwegian Elkhound was out on a walk with Bruno the Boxer. It was an 80-degree night and Tia was hot. We walked behind an ice skating rink and Tia spotted something that looked like heaven to her! A mound of snow scraped from the rink! Tia rubbed her nose all over it, rolling in the coolness. To her the snow on a hot day was better than horse poop!"

"Sophie, shown here as an adult, is a great Norwegian Elkhound. She has turned out to be an excellent companion and an all-around well-behaved dog. She loves climbing rocks and playing in the snow. Sophie lives in Canada and loves the cold winters. She will sleep comfortably outside in the snow at -30 degrees C (-22 Fahrenheit)."

"This is Apollo, our 2-year-old purebred Norwegian Elkhound. Apollo comes from a champion bloodline. He is a loyal, affectionate dog, and thoroughly enjoys his non-canine family members (cats and ferrets). He has many of the typical traits of his breed, including being a fierce squirrel hunter and incessant barker when an unknown animal or human is on his territory. He is a fantastic watchdog, yet would never cause harm to anyone. He loves the snow, and runs around like a puppy dragging his open mouth in the snow during storms. He also loves to play in lakes and streams during the warmer months. He resides with us in central Massachusetts."

Among dogs, there are few with such a striking coat and valiant personality as the Norwegian Elkhound. This stoutly compact athlete was bred for their dauntlessness and distinctive gray and black-tipped fluffy double coats reminiscent of gray wolves. Originally bred to hunt elk and moose, the Norwegian Elkhound makes a loving family guardian for any household daring enough to keep up with their independent hijinks and occasional stubborn streak.
Join us below as we wade into a bit more about this breed, including what they’re like and how to best care for them.

Despite being called a hound, the Norwegian Elkhound is in fact a spitz-type dog related to the Siberian Husky and Pomeranian. Like those breeds descended from ancient sled dogs, the Elkhound has a cheery, fluffy, and curled tail and a thick double coat. They were just known as hounds for their superior tracking abilities and, in fact, have no relation to hound-type dogs like the Bloodhound.

The Norwegian Elkhound is a very rare breed outside and even inside Norway, and you’ll have a devilish time finding a good breeder that specializes in them. Your best bet is the breed’s fan club: the Norwegian Elkhound Association of America.1 The NEAA regularly hosts regional social events where you can meet Elkhound owners and network to find reputable breeders. You can also try the AKC marketplace, which connects you with accredited breeders nationwide.
It can be very tricky to tell good breeders from dishonest puppy mills, especially if you’re a first-time dog owner. You can glean a lot about them online sometimes, but to really find out you have to do some homework and sleuthing. Let’s check out some tips for telling good breeders from breeders you should run and not walk away from.

Norwegian Elkhounds are a bit more independent than other dogs, but they’re among the most reliable and lively companions you can have. They’re full of boundless energy and curiosity to accompany you on your errands or the most arduous winter hikes, and they’re very social once they bond with you. Elkhounds are vocal about expressing their enthusiasm or disapproval, and they have no love for strangers either. They make fine guardian watchdogs with some obedience training.
This breed is prideful and stubborn at times, making them better suited for experienced dog owners. They’re super smart and trainable with patience and respect, but they don’t tolerate any nonsense! Norwegian Elkhounds are dynamic dogs that will make sure things don’t ever get too boring, and they need action to be happy. Most of all, they love being with their family and can be quite social when they relax.
Yes, Norwegian Elkhounds can make good family pets if you have older children or teenagers. We wouldn’t recommend them for those with small kids because they can play too. However, it is possible with stringent supervision. Elkhounds are very lively and will definitely encourage a more active lifestyle if you don’t already lead one!
Yes, but only other dogs. Norwegian Elkhounds can be sort of aloof toward other dogs at first, but extensive socialization can help them come out of their shell and become a very social family-oriented dog. They have a strong prey drive that makes cats a poor roommate, and smaller prey animals like guinea pigs or bunnies are at risk as well. If you have them, keep them in a separate room inaccessible to your dog and in a closed habitat.

Elkhounds are high-octane dogs that need a lot of food, but they have a habit of overeating and need strict portion control. Puppies need puppy food with 28% to 32% protein content, and then to a lower 20% to 24% once they reach maturity. Other major nutrients included in a complete and balanced kibble are carbs like rice and grain, vegetables, fruit, and sometimes fish.
Generally speaking, good kibble provides 100% of everything your dog needs to grow up and lead a healthy life.
Norwegian Elkhounds are highly active dogs that demand at least an hour of vigorous exercise per day. As puppies from 6 to 12 months, you actually want to limit their exercise to lower-impact activities to avoid skeletal and joint deformities like dysplasia. Light running, fetch, and ordinary yard antics should be fine, and you can try watersports too for a good low-impact activity the Elkhound will love. They’re adventurous at heart and more than happy to try any type of athletic activity at least once!
As a very smart breed, the Elkhound will need mental stimulation to keep them sharp and tire out that intrepid brain. Regular training sessions help encourage critical thinking and patience but won’t suffice alone. We suggest puzzle feeders to manage their penchant for overeating, and mental games, like hide and seek or obstacle courses, help tucker them out too.
Indoors, you can turn to stuffed Kongs to wile away bored afternoons or pack snuffle mats with kibble to make mealtime more enticing.
Norwegian Elkhounds can be willful and challenging for inexperienced dog owners, but it’s doable with grit and patience. You’ll need lots of positive reinforcement and a big bag of treats too! They become very trainable when you find the right treat to make it worth their while. Start with short training sessions for basic commands like sit. If they sit, shower them with praise and a treat to begin building a positive association with the action. Remain patient and keep the sessions short, as their attention span is shorter than you’d think!
Socialization in the key 4-to-16-week period is vital to forming a more polite, confident dog that won’t be fearful and aggressive at everything that moves in their sight. Elkhounds need your help to learn about the world in a controlled, on-the-leash manner. Ignore nuisance barking at other dogs or squirrels and stand stock still at any leash tugging to make it understood that it won’t get them anywhere.
When they calm down and exhibit behavior like curiosity or playfulness, reward them heavily to help them understand that unfamiliar things are exciting and not scary.
Norwegian Elkhounds have a thick, fluffy double coat that sheds moderately throughout the year but very heavily during spring and fall shedding seasons. Invest in a sturdy double-sided brush with pins on one side for detangling matted fur and a soft side for light de-shedding and redistributing skin oils through the fur.
As you can imagine, they can get quite unkempt if you neglect regular grooming, so make sure to stay on top of it. Baths should be every 6 weeks or as needed with a gentle, high-quality dog shampoo when they get visibly dirty.
Broadly speaking, Norwegian Elkhounds are healthy among large breeds when cared for properly and sourced from reputable breeders. However, you can’t screen out 100% of inherited health problems, and the Elkhound is victim to a distinctive set of them more often than other breeds. Let’s review some of those common health problems below so you can be more informed.

Male Elkhounds measure a little larger than females. Males grow from 20 to 21 inches tall and 55 to 60 pounds, whereas females hover at 19 to 20 inches tall and 45 to 50 pounds. There aren’t any noticeable personality differences between the two, and every dog has their own unique quirky personality worth loving.

Norwegian Elkhounds are one of the most ancient dog bloodlines in the world, and skeletons resembling them have been unearthed alongside 5,000 B.C. Vikings across Scandinavia. Their lineage has remained pure through all these years through insular breeding practices, and dogs are rarely exported.
Elkhounds were actually bred to hunt moose, despite the name. They have a rugged, cold-hardy coat, high endurance, and an uncanny talent for tracking. They were mostly bred to work off-leash to locate game and signal to hunters, but they sometimes work on-leash as well.
The Norwegian Elkhound is distinguished as the national dog of Norway, and supposedly, the Prime Minister can “activate” all of them for military service in times of great need. They truly have a sterling reputation no matter where they go!

Norwegian Elkhounds are a rare and sadly unappreciated breed with a passionate, social personality and intense athletic drive. They can take some work to train and socialize but mellow out into a marvelously versatile furry family guardian at home in any cold climate.
