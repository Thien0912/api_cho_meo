Old English Sheepdogs are known for their shaggy and cuddly appearance, but are they compatible with cats? While it may seem like a challenge to introduce these two very different animals, with proper training and socialization, Old English Sheepdogs and cats can live together harmoniously. In this article, we’ll explore the history and temperament of Old English Sheepdogs and cats, as well as factors to consider and tips for introducing them.
The Old English Sheepdog, also known as OES or Bobtail, originated in England in the 18th century. They were originally bred for herding sheep and cattle, and their trademark shaggy coat was used to protect them from the elements. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888. Today, Old English Sheepdogs are beloved family pets known for their affectionate and loyal personalities.
Old English Sheepdogs are known for their playful and affectionate nature. They are loyal, intelligent, and eager to please their owners. However, they can also be stubborn and independent at times. Old English Sheepdogs are typically good with children and other pets, including cats, but they may need some training and socialization to ensure a successful introduction. It’s important to note that each dog is unique and may have their own personality traits that affect their compatibility with cats.
Cats are known for their independent and curious nature. They are typically low maintenance pets, but require plenty of attention and playtime to keep them happy and healthy. Cats are also territorial animals, which can make introducing them to a new pet challenging. When considering the compatibility of cats and Old English Sheepdogs, it’s important to consider the individual personalities of each animal and their ability to adapt to new situations.
Before introducing an Old English Sheepdog to a cat, there are several factors to consider. First, it’s important to assess the personality of each animal and their compatibility with one another. It’s also important to consider the age and health of both animals, as well as their living arrangements and daily routine. Additionally, it’s important to ensure that both animals are up to date on their vaccinations and are in good health.
Training and socialization are key to ensuring a successful introduction between an Old English Sheepdog and a cat. Dogs should be trained to follow basic commands, such as “sit” and “stay,” and to walk calmly on a leash. Additionally, dogs should be socialized with other animals from a young age to ensure that they are comfortable around cats and other pets. Cats should also be socialized with other animals, and should be trained to use a scratching post and litter box.
When introducing an Old English Sheepdog to a cat, it’s important to take things slowly and carefully. Start by allowing the animals to sniff each other through a closed door, and gradually increase their exposure to each other over time. It’s important to supervise their interactions closely, and to reward good behavior with treats and praise. Additionally, it’s important to give each animal their own space and resources, such as food bowls and toys, to prevent competition and territorial behavior.

Start by allowing the animals to sniff each other through a closed door, and gradually increase their exposure to each other over time. It’s important to supervise their interactions closely, and to reward good behavior with treats and praise. Additionally, it’s important to give each animal their own space and resources, such as food bowls and toys, to prevent competition and territorial behavior.
A successful integration between an Old English Sheepdog and a cat can be seen through their behavior towards each other. Signs of a successful integration include playing together, cuddling, and grooming each other. Additionally, both animals should feel comfortable in each other’s presence and should not show any signs of aggression or fear.
Common issues that may arise when introducing an Old English Sheepdog to a cat include territorial behavior, aggression, and fear. To address these issues, it’s important to take things slowly and to supervise their interactions closely. It’s also important to give each animal their own space and resources to prevent competition. Additionally, professional training and behavior modification may be necessary in some cases.
Old English Sheepdogs and cats can live together harmoniously with proper training and socialization. It’s important to consider the individual personalities and needs of each animal before introducing them, and to take things slowly and carefully. With patience and persistence, these two very different animals can become the best of friends.

Old English sheepdogs, or OES, have a gentle nature that can make them perfect companions for cats who aren't intimidated by dogs. With the right temperaments, careful introductions, and time for them to get to know each other, your cat and your Old English sheepdog can become fast friends.
Old English sheepdogs, or OES, have a gentle nature that can make them perfect companions for cats who aren't intimidated by dogs. With the right temperaments, careful introductions, and time for them to get to know each other, your cat and your Old English sheepdog can become fast friends.
With their gentle, fun-loving and sociable temperaments, Old English sheepdogs often get along well with cats. In fact, if you must leave your canine buddy alone regularly, you might want to provide her with a dog-friendly feline pal. A kitty can offer the companionship your dog craves, and also keep her entertained, so she doesn’t grow bored and get into trouble. Sheepdogs are family-oriented, and many will easily expand their family circle to include cats and other pets.
An Old English sheepdog who has an amiable, easygoing temperament can probably adapt well to cats. Unfortunately, some breeders are not careful about selection of parent dogs for excellent temperament, health and emotional well-being, and their puppies may be mean, anxious and fearful. It is important to find a reputable breeder or a rescue that can match you with a basically friendly, clear-headed OES. These mellow dogs should be able to adjust quite easily to life with a cat, no matter their age. While a rambunctious puppy might be a better companion for a kitten, a well-bred adult Old English sheepdog usually has a gentle personality that won't seem threatening or overwhelming to many cats.
Kittens are just as varied temperamentally as dogs are, but they usually adjust more easily than adult cats to life with a dog, because kittens tend to be more bold, adventurous and open to new experiences and companions. That doesn’t mean you can’t introduce an adult cat to a dog, however, especially a mellow pooch like an Old English sheepdog. Some cats won’t ever welcome a big, sloppy canine infringing on their turf, while others will gradually develop a neutral, friendly and even playful relationship. Before you decide that two individual animals can live together, you should introduce them and see how they interact.
How you introduce the Old English sheepdog and the kitty can affect the speed with which they get comfortable, and even the quality of their relationship. Provide several high places where the cat can retreat to safely check things out. If possible, let her enter the room a few minutes before you bring in the dog, so she can explore the space and identify escape routes. Watch both animals’ body language during the initial encounter. If your canine pal seems hostile, growls or snaps, he's probably not going to be the best companion for a kitty. If the cat cowers in a corner, spits or hisses, she might never get along with a dog. On the other hand, if she seems more curious than frightened -- even if she keeps her distance -- you might have the potential for a good match. Let the animals get used to each other at their own pace, and you might end up seeing the beginning of a lifelong friendship.

Old English Sheepdogs were most likely first bred sometime in the 1700s to work as cattle drovers and keep livestock in line, but their precise history is shrouded in mystery.
They weren’t treated as a distinct breed until the 1800s. Old English Sheepdogs are muscular, strong, and surprisingly agile. They were first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888 and were the 74th most popular breed according to the organization’s numbers in 2022.

It’s difficult to find Old English Sheepdog puppies at shelters, but purebred adult dogs are surrendered occasionally. The easiest way to locate adoptable puppies is by working with a reputable breeder.
Adult dogs can be adopted through rescue organizations, and adopting grown pups can have several benefits since they’re already house-trained and socialized.
Old English Sheepdog puppies are incredibly intelligent and playful. They can start working on basic commands as soon as they come home, and they’re ready for puppy classes once they have all their required vaccinations and are old enough to participate.

Easy-going and fun, Old English Sheepdogs generally love to hang out with their families. Most are laid-back, relaxed, and usually more than happy to play with children.
They’re extraordinarily smart and adaptable but are occasionally described as stubborn, and some have loud barks that sound like pots banging against each other.
Old English Sheepdogs love to hang out at home, and they’re famous for jumping fences and following kids to school. They’re happiest when their favorite people are around, and some can become irritated when not receiving enough attention.
Old English Sheepdogs make fantastic companions for families with children. They’re kind, gentle, loving, and devoted to their favorite humans.
Supervising them around small children is necessary since Old English Sheepdogs are big enough to injure them unintentionally.
Old English Sheepdogs get along well with other resident dogs but are sometimes less than enthusiastic about hanging out with animals they don’t know.
Many Old English Sheepdogs can also get along with cats with socialization and training to learn how to manage their herding and chasing instincts.

Old English Sheepdogs don’t have special dietary requirements. High-quality commercial formulas featuring the Association of American Feed Control Officials’ statements of nutritional adequacy feature all the nutrients dogs require.
Puppies require more protein and fat than adult dogs, so they need to eat food formulated for them. They also need to eat more frequently than adults to ensure they keep their growing bodies fueled. Adult dogs generally need to eat at least two times per day.
Most manufacturers include instructions that can be used to determine how much to feed dogs to ensure they get the nutrients they need and stay at healthy weights. However, it’s best to speak to your vet about brand recommendations and feeding portions.
Old English Sheepdogs were bred to spend their days driving cattle from place to place, and they need a few hours of exercise to keep them happy and healthy.
They enjoy going on walks, playing fetch, and exploring the woods with their owners on long camping weekends. While they’re usually pretty easy-going, Old English Sheepdogs who don’t get enough exercise sometimes become destructive and bark excessively.
Because Old English Sheepdogs are so large, they must be trained to behave when meeting people and interacting with new animals. They are easy to train and eager to learn.
Obedience training can be helpful when it comes to ensuring Old English Sheepdogs can control their enthusiasm and play nicely with others. Training with positive, reward-based techniques can be motivating and fun and a great bonding activity. Old English Sheepdogs also enjoy training for agility competitions.
Old English Sheepdogs have beautiful, shaggy, waterproof double coats that keep them warm and dry. They require daily grooming to keep their coats shiny and healthy.
Some sources suggest that properly grooming these gorgeous dogs can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours every week. Taking them for regular grooming sessions can sometimes make things a bit less time-consuming.
Attention must be paid to their skin to ensure dirt and debris don’t get stuck and start causing problems. Their facial fur must be checked daily to ensure little bits of food are removed. Their ears (and the fur around them) also require special attention to keep ear infections at bay.
Homes with Old English Sheepdogs require frequent vacuuming due to the amount of fur the dogs leave behind.
Old English Sheepdogs are pretty healthy; most live around 10 to 12 years. They are, however, at increased risk for a few conditions.

Although male Old English Sheepdogs are a bit larger than females, that’s the only significant difference between the sexes. Neutered and spayed dogs generally don’t engage in much sex-hormone-driven behavior, and there isn’t much of a difference in temperament between altered male and female dogs.
Environmental factors and genetics strongly influence canine temperament and behavior rather than sex.

Old English Sheepdogs have appeared in several movies, including The Shaggy Dog, The Shaggy D.A., 101 Dalmatians, Cats & Dogs, and The Little Mermaid.
While the precise background of Old English Sheepdogs is hard to uncover, Scottish Bearded Collies and Russian Owtchars have both been cited as potential ancestors.
Old English Sheepdogs often had their tails docked so their owners could avoid paying taxes. Animals with docked tails were considered working dogs and exempt from taxation.

Old English Sheepdogs are fun, bold, lively, and affectionate. They were bred to drive cattle to market and generally take care of business on farms, and they’re hardy, intelligent, and adaptable. They also need plenty of exercise to stay centered.
They’re easy to train and enjoy participating in agility competitions and going on long walks. Old English Sheepdogs are great family dogs and wonderful companions for older children, but they also require frequent grooming due to their gorgeous, shaggy coats.

The Old English Sheepdog (OES), a striking, shaggy-coated breed, is renowned for its unmistakable bear-like gait and fluffy fur. This breed’s coat consists of a dense, weather-resistant double layer with a soft undercoat and a coarse outer coat. Breed-standard colors include shades of grey, grizzle, blue, and merle, often accompanied by white markings.
Physically, Old English Sheepdogs are robust and powerful. Males typically stand 22 inches or taller at the shoulders, while females are slightly smaller. Weight can range from 60 to 100 pounds. Their lifespan averages between 10 to 12 years when given proper care.
Historically, the Old English Sheepdog traces its origins back to the 18th-century English countryside. Bred primarily to assist farmers with herding cattle and sheep, they developed exceptional stamina and intelligence. Often referred to as “drovers,” they helped move livestock to markets, earning their keep as hard-working and versatile farm dogs.
While no longer common as working farm dogs, Old English Sheepdogs excel in various modern roles such as therapy work, competitive obedience, and even canine sports like agility and herding trials. Their adaptable nature and energy levels make them excellent companions for active families.
The Old English Sheepdog is known for its gentle and affectionate nature. This breed is intelligent and quick to bond with family members, displaying loyalty and a playful demeanor. They thrive on human interaction and often seek attention through amusing, clown-like behavior.
Despite their endearing qualities, Old English Sheepdogs can exhibit a stubborn streak, which requires patience during training. With children, they are playful, tolerant, and naturally protective, making them a beloved family companion. They also tend to get along well with cats and other pets when socialized from an early age.
Barking levels are moderate—they will bark to alert their owners but are generally not excessive. OES can be friendly with strangers, though some exhibit a cautious demeanor until they sense no threat. While they possess a strong protective instinct, they do not make ideal guard dogs. However, their imposing size and deep bark can deter intruders.
Old English Sheepdogs dislike being left alone for long periods and can become anxious or destructive when isolated. They are best suited to families that can offer ample companionship. Similarly, leaving them outside unsupervised is not recommended due to their sensitivity to heat and tendency to seek company.

Training an Old English Sheepdog requires consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement. While they are intelligent and capable of learning commands quickly, their independent nature can sometimes pose challenges. Socialization at an early age helps curb unwanted stubbornness.
Grooming is a critical aspect of Old English Sheepdog care. Their dense double coat requires brushing at least three times a week to prevent matting and tangles. Regular visits to a professional groomer are advisable, as the coat may need trimming every few months. Nail clipping, ear cleaning, and regular baths using dog-safe shampoo are also essential.
Housing needs for an Old English Sheepdog are significant. They do best in a large house with a securely fenced yard where they can roam and exercise. Small apartments are less suitable due to their size and activity level. Their heavy build means flooring must provide good traction to avoid slips. Additionally, securing fences is crucial as they are capable of jumping fairly high if motivated.
A breeding pair of Old English Sheepdogs can be housed together, provided they are introduced properly and have ample space. They can also coexist with other breeds, especially easygoing dogs like Golden Retrievers or Labradors.
OES adapt well to colder climates due to their dense fur but struggle in hot weather. Adequate shade, water, and cooling measures must be provided in warm temperatures.

For adopters seeking an adult Old English Sheepdog, health history and temperament assessments are vital. Check for up-to-date vaccinations and signs of joint issues or vision problems. Rescue centers often provide behavioral insights to ensure compatibility.
When buying a puppy, look for clear eyes, a clean coat, and energetic behavior. Avoid puppies showing lethargy or limping. Ask breeders for health screenings, vaccination records, and lineage papers. Ensure the breeder is reputable and complies with ethical breeding standards.
Breeding this breed requires proper planning. Pregnant females need a nutrient-rich diet and regular vet checkups. Newborn puppies require warmth, proper nutrition, and gentle handling. Popular in regions like the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe, Old English Sheepdogs are cherished for their charm and versatility.
