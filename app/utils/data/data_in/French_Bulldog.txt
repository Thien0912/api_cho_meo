Living with a cat and a French Bulldog can be a harmonious experience, but it requires some effort and understanding of their unique needs. Cats are generally more independent and territorial, while French Bulldogs are social and affectionate.
French Bulldogs are adaptable and can thrive in smaller living spaces, making them a great fit for city dwellers. This adaptability can also help them live peacefully with cats in smaller homes.
To ensure a smooth coexistence, it's essential to establish a routine for both pets, including regular feeding times, exercise, and playtime. This can help reduce competition and stress between the two animals.

Introducing your French Bulldog to a cat requires patience and careful planning. Keep the two separated at first, allowing them to adjust to their new environment.
Place each animal's belongings in the other's space so they can get used to each other's scents. This is a good tip to help them feel more comfortable.
Let both the cat and dog have a few days to get used to each other's scents before their first meeting.
The first meeting should be brief, lasting no longer than a couple of minutes. It's essential to keep your puppy on a leash the whole time.
Have at least one more person in the room who your pets trust, in case things get out of hand.
A good idea is to have your cat decide how close they get to the dog, rather than forcing them to interact. This will help prevent stress and anxiety.
Here are some steps to keep in mind when introducing your Frenchie to a cat:
French Bulldogs are known for their amazing temperament and adorable personality, thanks to which they get along with basically anyone from kids to older people, other dogs and even cats.
Early socialization is always important, so the best you can do is to get a puppy and a cat who are close in age and will grow up together.
It may just take a bit more time to get them used to each other if you already have a Frenchie or a cat and are thinking about getting another pet.
Getting a puppy and a cat who are close in age will help them become best friends, as they'll grow up together and learn to live with each other.
Early socialization is key to a harmonious coexistence between cats and French Bulldogs. This means getting a puppy and a cat who are close in age and will grow up together.
To introduce your Frenchie and cat, keep their first meeting brief, no longer than a couple of minutes. It's essential to keep your puppy on a leash and let your cat decide how close they get.
Having a trusted person in the room can help intervene if things get out of hand. Avoid keeping your cat in a crate, as this can be stressful for them.

To help your cat and Frenchie get used to each other's scents, try placing an item that smells like your Frenchie in your cat's space, and vice versa. Introduce this item at mealtime to associate the scent with a positive reward.
With patience and pre-planning, your Frenchie and cat can become best friends.
Cats and French Bulldogs can coexist peacefully if they're socialized properly from an early age, as seen in households where they've been raised together.
French Bulldogs, being relatively small and laid-back, can be a great match for cat owners who want a low-maintenance companion.
In households with both cats and French Bulldogs, it's essential to establish a routine that allows for separate spaces and activities to prevent territorial conflicts.
Giving both your cat and dog enough space is crucial for their comfort and well-being. Cats are very territorial and need a high place to escape to, like the top of a climbing post or a shelf.
Puppies can be too energetic and intrusive for cats, so it's essential to provide a safe space for both pets. This means keeping their things in the right place, like the litterbox, out of reach of your dog.
Your cat's bed should be placed somewhere high where your dog can't reach it. This will help prevent any conflicts over resources and ensure both pets have a comfortable place to sleep.
By giving both pets their own space, you can help them learn to respect each other's territories and reduce stress in the household.

When you're introducing your pets for the first time, it's crucial to pay attention to body language. Positive signs include relaxed postures.
Relaxed pets often display wagging tails. Friendly approaches are also a good sign.
On the other hand, signs of aggression can include growling. Hissing is another warning sign. Raised fur can also indicate tension. A stiff body posture is a clear sign of aggression.
If you notice any aggressive behavior, it's essential to intervene promptly. This means separating the pets to prevent any harm.
French Bulldogs are prone to breathing difficulties due to their brachycephalic breed, so regular veterinary check-ups are crucial to ensure their health and well-being.
Proper veterinary care is essential for both French Bulldogs and cats, especially when introducing them to each other.
Socialization, patience, and positive reinforcement play key roles in ensuring a successful coexistence between French Bulldogs and cats.
Consulting a professional animal behaviourist can provide valuable guidance tailored to your specific situation if you encounter any challenges in their relationship.
Respecting their individual space and providing supervised interactions can help foster a positive and harmonious relationship between French Bulldogs and cats.
French Bulldogs have a high-prey drive, which means they'll chase small animals if not properly trained. Proper recall training is essential to manage this instinct and ensure a harmonious household.

They’re adorable, they dominate Instagram, and they’re one of the hottest dog breeds of the moment: what else could they be besides French Bulldogs? This small breed has won the hearts of millions of pet owners who just have to have one of these wrinkled smoosh-faced doggos in their homes. But what if you already have a cat? How do French Bulldogs and cats get along?
You don’t want to do anything to displease your kitty to the point they start wagging their tail in frustration, but how can you say no to a cute canine addition to your furry family?
The thing is, you don’t have to! We’re going to discuss everything you need to know about French Bulldogs and how to build a great friendship between them and your cat in this article.
Contents
Environmental factors and genetics always play a role in personality, but generally speaking, adult Frenchies are a small, loving breed with big bat ears and little love for exercise. This makes them perfect apartment dogs, especially seeing as they aren’t big on barking.
They’re mostly adaptable to any home you provide them with, though. As puppies, they’ll have more energy and want to expend it playing and getting into typical puppy trouble. If you can outlast this period of feisty toddlerhood, you’ll be rewarded with a chill pet that loves to love.
They’re also quite a charismatic breed, making it hard not to fall head over heels for their adorable personality quirks and charming intelligence.
I have a series of articles on how different dog breeds get along with cats: Can Poodles and Cats Get Along?, Shih Tzus and Cats, Labradoodles and Cats, Rottweilers and Cats, Corgis and Cats, Golden Retrievers and Cats and German Shepherds and Cats.

There are some slight differences between females and males, too. Males are more likely to be playful and assertive, whereas females tend to be more docile and timid.  This being said, it’s not impossible to end up with a reclusive, barky, aggressive French Bulldog.
If the dog has a bad upbringing in its formative puppy months, undesirable traits may become part of its adult personality. That’s why puppy socialization is so important. They also tend to have a bit of a stubborn streak which solidifies as they age. If you start young, though, no dog is beyond training.
Frenchies love to be the center of attention. They want that coveted spot on your lap just like cats sleep by your head. Basically, they’re at their happiest in your company because they’re such devoted pets.
Depending on the personality of your cat, the two may end up feeling competitive over who gets to snuggle in the prime positions on or near their person. If both of them are fairly stubborn, you may have a bit of a trial in training them to get along. The important thing is to never neglect one in favor of the other.
Frenchies can get a little jealous, it’s true — but if you make sure you give your pets equal attention, they shouldn’t feel the need to compete, and your Frenchie will feel comforted. If you take the time to introduce your new pup to your cat the right way, this will help solidify their friendship and make them feel more secure in their relationship with you, too.
Having done this, there’s no reason why they couldn’t be the best furry friends ever.

The best time to bring in a new pet is when they’re young; even better if the resident pet is also young at the same time. They’re still soft and amenable at this age to new experiences, people, and animals, and are more likely to accept changes than an older pet.
If you already have an older cat, though, it’s not impossible to introduce your new pup — especially if your cat was socialized properly at an early age. It just might take more time for them to come to a mutual understanding. Here are the steps of introduction you should follow for a smooth meeting:
Delegate a room for your cat and then let your pup roam around the house, getting used to their new environment and all the strange smells and items.
They’ll smell your cat as they cruise through the rooms soaking up everything they come across, so this is a great way for your pup to “meet” your cat for the first time. After this, put your pup in a room and let your cat explore the house and discover the pupper’s new scent.
This way, they’ll begin to get used to the idea of each other before they’re even in the same room. You can keep them separate for a few days at first until they become familiar and comfortable with the smells of each other.
Image by Mar from Pixabay
The next step is letting them see each other so they can finally realize who that smell is coming from. It’s best to do this with a barrier and some distance between them, whether it’s with a puppy playpen or a crate.
It should also be done in short intervals at first — ten minutes is more than enough — and if you feed treats and reinforce good behavior with praise, even better! This is so they can get used to each other’s presence in a gentle, non-threatening way and start to associate each other with positive things.
Cats can be territorial, so this meeting should take place in a neutral room that doesn’t “belong” to either pet. Monitor both their body language and behavior, and remove them if you notice any signs of stress or aggression.
If they do get tense and stressed out, don’t think of it as a bad omen — they can still build a good relationship; it just means it’s off to a slightly rocky start. Give your unsettled pet plenty of comfort, and keep attempting these barrier-distance interactions until they manage to endure it comfortably with as little stress as possible.
Once you’re satisfied that they’re fairly used to each other, allow them to get close and get a proper sniff in. But be close at hand at all times, ready to intervene if you notice any unhappiness.
Your cat might start purring and biting, or your pup might display stress signals like yawning or shaking. Either way, simply remove them from close proximity and try again later. Remember to reward their tolerance for each other with praise and treats, and they will grow to accept the other more readily with your encouragement.

Sometimes things don’t go the way we want. Perhaps your cat is too old to put up with the energy of a puppy, or maybe your pup is too anxious around your kitty. Even with the best socialization practices and techniques, some throwback genes may make this meeting a tough one.
Don’t despair, though: there are things that can be done to alleviate the situation, and sometimes one of the biggest things is to remain calm and give them the time they need.
Your cat is more likely to be accepting of a doggo that’s smaller than them — or at least similar in size — so Frenchies have got that working in their favor.
But overall, they’re amazing dogs with loving natures, even if they can be a little stubborn, and they’re fit to be a perfect companion to your cat. Just don’t skimp on the introductions.

You’ve probably heard the phrase “fighting like cats and dogs” and wondered, are French Bulldogs good with cats?!
It’s a common misconception that cats and dogs are natural enemies.
While every animal is different, there should be no reason why your French Bulldog can’t be best friends with a cat!
It’s in dogs’ nature to want to chase cats; they are natural predators that love chasing things smaller than them.
Unfortunately, this sometimes includes cats.
Dogs inherited this prey drive from their wolf ancestors and despite being domesticated over 12,000 years ago, they still have this instinct ingrained in their behavior.
Contrary to popular belief, cats and dogs can actually be best friends!
With a little bit of forethought and patience, your French Bulldog is sure to do great around cats.
It’s completely normal for your French Bulldog to want to chase a cat if they’ve never been around any cats before.
Be patient and don’t get frustrated with this; it’s just part of their nature.
If you haven’t already, you’re going to want to do some obedience training with your Frenchie.
If your Frenchie did some training previously but it’s been a while, it’s probably a good idea for a few training sessions before they meet the cat.
You want your Frenchie to be able to respond and behave in any situation to reduce the risk of injury.
Have realistic expectations for the first few meetings.
Don’t be discouraged if they don’t immediately “click” their first time seeing each other.
Just like us humans, it takes time for pets to develop a friendship.
Be patient.
Picking the proper location for your pets to meet for their first time is crucial.
You’re going to want a calm, controlled environment.
You don’t want there to be any other animals around. Just your cat and dog.
Some ideas for places they can meet are
Slow down! The last thing you want to do when introducing your French Bulldog to any cat is to immediately place them a room together with no rules!
Keep the two separated at first; let them adjust to their new environment.
A good tip is to place each animal’s belongings in the other’s space so they can get used to each other’s scents. Let both of them have a few days to get comfortable being around the other’s scent.
Once you have the cat and dog going about their own business, as usual, they are ready for their first meeting.
The first meeting should be brief. Around ten minutes is a good guideline. You’re going to want to keep your Frenchie secure on its leash and let the cat approach when it feels comfortable.
Reward your dog for calm behavior with praise and treats. Your meetings should be similar to the first one until your Frenchie has calmed down and is ignoring the cat. Your cat will be comfortable when it is calm, eating and using its litter box as it does normally.
If you feel things are getting out of hand, separate them immediately.
You can slowly increase the amount of time they spend together over time. Keep in mind that it can take weeks or months for the two to be completely comfortable with each other’s presence.
If you notice any signs of aggression or anxiety from either animal, stop the meeting immediately and reduce the duration of the next meeting.
Once your Frenchie has calmed down and you are comfortable with the two being around each other, you’re going to want to let him walk around freely. Keep the leash on just in case, but keep it loose enough so he can move as he wishes.
This should be a no-brainer. Not only are some dogs territorial over their food, they might also eat the cat’s food and get sick. They need to learn to respect each other’s boundaries; it’s not a free-for-all.
This is especially important in the early phases of their friendship. You never know when things may go wrong; it just takes one accident.
Even if you’re going to use the bathroom for less than a minute, make sure you either put your Frenchie in its crate or move the cat to another room. When you’re completely confident that the two can get along with no problems, you’ll be able to leave them alone.
Before your Frenchie and cat meet, it is always a great idea to go for a walk or play fetch to tucker him out. If your Frenchie has been laying around sleeping all day, he’s much more likely to get over-excited when he sees the cat.
When you’re first starting out, keeping your Frenchie on a leash is a must. It gives you complete control over the situation and lets you stop things the moment they get out of hand.
You don’t want to be scrambling to grab your Frenchie off the cat; the damage will already be done.
Positive reinforcement is much better than yelling and reprimanding your dog. If you give tons of praise and treats when your Frenchie is calm around the cat, he’ll be more likely to do the same the next meeting.
If there’s anything your Frenchie might like more than playing with a cat, it’s probably food.
Even if your Frenchie is the most loving, timid dog in the world that wouldn’t hurt a fly, you should still keep a few things in mind. Introducing your French Bulldog to a cat can quickly go south if you aren’t well-prepared.
A large part of communication in both humans and animals is body language. Unlike us humans, animals obviously cannot verbally communicate; their body language is their only method of communication. It’s important that you understand cats and dogs interpret each other’s body language differently.
For example, a dog may raise its paw to the cat to signal it wants to play, however, the cat might interpret this as a form of aggression and attack the dog. Another example is that cats often rub up against people or dogs to be friendly, but your dog might take this gesture as a threat.
Cats and dogs don’t speak the same language and often misjudge the other’s true intentions. This is why it’s so important that you are always supervising them until you are completely confident that they won’t harm each other.
An overexcited Frenchie can seriously injure or even kill a cat. French Bulldogs are known for roughhousing with each other; they might not understand that cats can’t play the same way.
Cats can also seriously hurt a Frenchie with just one scratch. Because of Frenchies’ flat faces and bulging eyes, it’s not hard for a scratch to take out an eye! They don’t have long noses to protect their eyes! Be extra precautious if the cat is known for swiping at things.
If you notice any of the following signs, you should be wary of going on with their meetings. If you are determined for them to have a good friendship, you might want to consider getting help from a professional animal behaviorist.

How to find a puppy and raise a happy, healthy dog
February 2, 2022 By Lucy 27 Comments
The French Bulldog dog breed has an affectionate, friendly, outgoing personality contained in a compact body. French Bulldog puppies are gentle companion dogs with big bat ears and expressive eyes. They are loyal to their families, and love attention. Today we’ll share fun French Bulldog facts and fascinating breed traits. We’ll learn about French Bulldog puppies’ characteristics and history. Including what French Bulldogs should look like. You’ll have a simple guide to buying, adopting, raising and caring for an adult French Bulldog too.
Happy French Bulldogs have a good level of health, as well as lots of focus from their families. They might be a show dog, apartment pet, lapdog or first time puppy, but either way fitness is key. Helping your toy dog with their weight will improve their predicted lifespan. We’ll also see whether searching for an even smaller French Bulldog like a teacup Frenchie is a good idea. And we’ll look at whether French Bulldogs are clever, and if they are well tempered too. And in case you think maybe a French Bulldog isn’t your ideal pet, we’ll share some similar breed too.
This popular, friendly breed has a great appeal. And not just because of their lovely personality. There is a lot more to this little bulldog than meets the eye.
Let’s get to know everything about him before you make your choice.
Here are our readers’ most popular and frequently asked questions about the French Bulldog. Click on one of them to jump down to the relevant part of the article.
French Bulldogs are widely loved because they are cute, compact and characterful. Their flat faces give them almost human expressions, and their loyal natures make their human families feel loved. Being a tiny dog they are incredibly portable. And their low activity level makes them relaxed to be around. Sadly however, some of these things that seem like good characteristics are as a result of health issues.
Despite his name, the French Bulldog is English in origin. When bull and bear baiting became illegal in the 19th Century, the role of the bulldog became that of a companion.
Increasingly smaller dogs were developed to fulfill this new role. It is these dogs from which our modern Frenchie descended. Their oversized ears gained particular favor in France, where they were deliberately bred to exaggerate this feature.
This over-sizing of ears initially caused controversy initially between Kennel Clubs. Over the years the matter was settled though, and the large ears of the French Bulldog seem set to stay. Their popularity has rocketed to unprecedented levels.
Let’s take a look at this breed’s iconic looks.
Before we dive into the appearance of the Frenchie we know today, it’s important to first understand how we got here.
The rise and rise of the Frenchie is an impressive one. The recent fashion for them in celebrity circles is undoubtedly helping to drive their sudden increase in popularity.
But sadly, it is coming at a serious price for the dogs themselves. Because French Bulldogs suffer from some very serious health problems.
The above French Bulldog in this image was photographed in 1905. You can see that there is some substantial length to his muzzle, and that his nostrils are open. Compare with the modern Frenchies pictured elsewhere in this article. Their nostrils are all but closed, and deep facial skin folds have formed around the muzzle.
He has large bat-like ears, a very short nose and soulful expression. His build is stocky and he is very short in stature, normally no more than 12 inches tall or weighing 25 pounds.
The French Bulldog has a broad chest and narrow hips. His face is wrinkled, with the top lip overhanging the bottom one in the classic Bulldog pout.
Frenchie colors are broken down into three categories – brindle, fawn and pied. Brindle French Bulldogs have a mix of black and fawn hairs. They may have a few white hairs too, but the brindle will cover the majority of their bodies.
Fawn French Bulldogs will be entirely fawn in color, with the exception of the face which can be black. Pied Frenchies are mostly white, with patches of brindle or fawn coloring. All of them should have black ‘eyeliner’ around the rims of their eyes, black lashes and black lips.
You can also find black, black and white French Bulldogs, black and tan and even blue French Bulldogs, in a variety of patterns and markings.
These colors and combinations of colors are not considered acceptable as far as the Kennel Club’s standards go. Nonetheless they have still proven very popular with pet dog owners.
If you don’t care about your ability to show a Frenchie in the ring, then it really doesn’t matter what color his coat is. Although there have been some associations drawn between blue Frenchies and poor health.
While some colors may be desirable to you, it’s important not to seek out these colors to the detriment of the breed. Avoid puppy farms even if they do promise to breed for the color you like. You can read our articles on Frenchie colors here:
The fur itself is short, smooth and easy to manage for his owner. Needing just a casual grooming session with a bristle brush once a week, as long as he hasn’t got mucky in the meantime.
Fortunately, their gentle nature means grooming should be an enjoyable activity for you both. Compared to other dogs, Frenchies don’t shed much. You can read all about it here.
You may have noticed a trend of miniature versions of dog breeds becoming popular. In the case of the Frenchie, there is no official tiny breed. There are mini Frenchies that are cross breeds between a French Bulldog and a toy breed.You can read more about them here.
French Bulldogs are bred as lap dogs, and are friendly to their family and willing to please. The typical temperament is very loving and loyal. They are often keen on being petted, and will happily curl up and sleep on your lap. Although small, this breed has the active mind of a dog.
They are intelligent creatures, who require mental stimulation despite their easy-going appearance. Just like any larger breed of dog, Frenchie dogs benefit from structured, positive reinforcement training from a young age.
It’s important to well socialize a Frenchie puppy as although laid back, they can display guarding behaviors towards strangers or visitors.
Make sure to get your pup used to meeting a lot of different people, especially children. Make sure that any visiting children are aware that they should treat the dog like any other. Despite being the size of a toy they certainly shouldn’t be mishandled.
A Frenchie puppy will need potty training and to learn to come when they are called. There are lots of other fun things you can teach your pup, but it’s important to take into account their exercise needs.
These dogs are particularly prone to overheating and breathing issues, due to the structure of their faces.
It is really important not to over-exercise this breed as a result of these overheating and breathing issues. French Bulldogs and other brachycephalic dogs are prone to heatstroke because they cannot access enough oxygen to keep them cool and refreshed.
While it’s important to train your Frenchie dog to be sociable, it is not recommended to make these dogs exert themselves too much physically.
If you are thinking of bringing a Frenchie puppy into your home and your heart, then this is the most important section of this article that you will read.
French Bulldog health is a distressing topic for any dog lover to go into. Because they are in serious trouble.
All breeds of pedigree dogs have some health problems common to their type.
Fortunately, these days many pedigree health issues can be avoided by only buying a French Bulldog puppy from health tested parents.
There are some diseases which can sometimes affect French Bulldogs that we can use health screening to avoid.
So, several of these health problems can be avoided or reduced by sensible puppy purchasing.
Unfortunately, other issues are so ingrained into the body structure of the breed that they are impossible to avoid.
Let’s take a look at some serious health problems that will impact your puppy, if you choose to bring a Frenchie home.
And what you could do to help your puppy avoid them.
Research suggests that over half of Frenchies suffer from a form of dwarfism called chondrodystrophy. Chondrodystrophy creates features that are considered desirable by breeders, but this characteristic appearance comes at a price.
High incidence of hemivertebrae and premature disc degeneration are seen in this breed. Problems relating to chondrodystrophy are impossible to avoid entirely when picking a French Bulldog puppy. All Frenchies have this type of dwarfism.
When you buy a Frenchie, you will have to accept that it will probably never have a natural birth, and that they may suffer from severe back or gait problems down the line.
Another potential problem in a related area is with French Bulldog tails.
The breed standard calls for French Bulldog tails to be short and undocked. But of course, nature made dogs with long tails originally.
And when short tails occur, they also bring along problems, especially when they are in the form of screw tails. The problems with screw tails can be very severe, causing spinal problems and defects in the dog.
These can cause mobility problems, and when these screw tails occur they can even compress a duct and cause impacted anal glands.
You can find out more about screw tails and hemivertibrae here.
If you buy a Frenchie puppy, then make sure that their parents both have protruding tails. And ask the breeder about any history of back, mobility, or anal gland problems.
These are nasty conditions, but probably not the most worrying one that all French Bulldogs have to deal with.
That comes from the way the French Bulldog’s face is constructed.
One of the factors many people find appealing about French Bulldogs are their flat faces.
The set of their eyes and reduced muzzle size give them a more human, baby-like appearance. This face shape is something which has been bred into dogs quite rapidly over recent years.
The Frenchie dog face has not evolved naturally, but has been designed by the deliberate breeding together of dogs with smaller and smaller muzzles.
If you look at the 1905 photograph earlier in the article, you can see that whilst the bulldog’s muzzle is small it is still definitely pronounced.
The dog has a prominent nose, open nostrils and tight skin. Take a look at the difference in this dog’s profile:
His nostrils are practically closed, and his face is surrounded by folds of skin which lack the muzzle bones to support them. It has caused the French Bulldogs some very serious health problems. Because dogs need muzzles.
Like their Bulldog cousins, Frenchies have become increasingly flat faced over the last few decades.
Flat faced dogs are referred to as ‘brachycephalic’, and this condition is linked to a number of health issues.
These health conditions are grouped together under the heading brachycephalic airway syndrome.
Brachycephalic puppies have short facial bones, but the same amount of facial tissue as a dog with a normal length muzzle.
This means that there is too much tissue inside the dog’s mouth. More tissue than the muzzle has space for.
In many cases the dogs palate may block the airway so severely that surgery will be necessary to save him from respiratory distress.
His eyes can also be affected, because the proportion of his skull won’t accommodate his eyeballs.
You can find out more about brachycephalic ocular syndrome here.
Affected dogs also have narrow nostrils. You will often see on pictures of Frenchies that the nostrils are barely visible. These nostrils are known as ‘stenotic nares’.
Think how hard it is to breathe when you have a cold and your nose is blocked? Most French Bulldogs feel like this every moment of their lives.
Not only is this uncomfortable, but it means that your dog’s ability to get enough air is compromised.
He can’t oxygenate himself. Nor can be effectively cool himself down. He overheats easily. So he can’t run very far, or cope when the weather is hot.
The cute snuffly noises that French Bulldogs make are actually due to their inability to gather breathe efficiently.
French Bulldogs are also very hard for veterinarians to intubate due to their physiology.
This means that if they do require anesthetizing for an essential surgery, this can be very hard to do.
This is not something that affects just a few French Bulldogs. All brachycephalic dogs have compromised airways to some extent.
And many are severely affected.
French Bulldogs are among those breeds often described as low energy dogs. But what does that mean? In the case of the brachycephalic dogs, low energy means exactly that. Low energy.
Not because the dogs are not interested in continuing to run and play whatever the weather, like their muzzled cousins. But because they rapidly run out of the energy to do so.
French Bulldogs have low energy because they are not able to get enough oxygen into their tiny bodies. Have a think about why you want to share your life with a low energy dog.
If you desperately want a dog but hate exercise, then consider rescuing a dog who has a health problem rather than buying into a trade of deliberately breeding disabled dogs.
If you are shocked by the comment above, it might be because you have heard that some dogs are simply low energy dogs anyway.
You may have heard that it’s ‘normal for the breed’. So let’s take a look at what that actually means.
You will often hear the phrase ‘normal for the breed’ used to justify health problems.
“It’s okay that my dog can’t breathe properly, it’s normal for the breed.” Or “Don’t worry about the fact she couldn’t birth the puppies without surgery, it’s normal for the breed.”
Normal for the breed means that most members of that group of dogs show the same characteristic. The reason for this is that a breed is produced from a select number of dogs by people who want to exaggerate or retain certain features.
These features are decided and agreed upon by humans, who then deliberately set out to produce them. This process produces certain characteristics which are desirable to breeders, and when most dogs have them, they become normal.
But when normality means a life of misery, then ‘normal for the breed’ is not a justification. It’s just a fact.
Yes, it is normal for a French Bulldog to be unable to run around like his long snouted friends.
And to need urgent access to shade when the day grows hotter so that he doesn’t collapse. It is normal. It is not okay.
Even the breed standard image used to illustrate their ideal for the French Bulldog breed by the AKC is concerning. The dog pictured has closed nostrils.
It is an image demonstrating what is normal for the breed, but it is a seriously undesirable characteristic when it comes to the health of the dog.
If someone tells you something you know to be a bad thing is normal for the breed, then sadly you need to start looking at another breed.
Alternatively, look for a breeder who wants to move away from this misconceived normality, to something better.
The average Frenchie lifespan is nine years.
This is according to a wide ranging survey of purebred dogs and their mortality in the United Kingdom.

When caring for a French Bulldog you will need to take into account that this is effectively a disabled dog, with a lot of special needs.
Make sure that you are prepared to monitor and limit your dog’s exercise, especially in warmer weather.
You must also check his eyes daily, to make sure they are not too dry or injured.
French Bulldog care isn’t always pleasant. Be aware that you might have to wipe his bottom for him on occasion. Some Frenchies can’t reach their own behinds, and their tails can get mucky if they are screwed.
Wipe his skin folds on his face regularly to avoid dermatitis and infections. You can use cotton wool and boiled water, or buy packs of wet wipes for dogs.
Due to their body shape, some French Bulldogs are also unable to swim.
In terms of personality, the Frenchie has the potential to make a great family pet.
But when it comes to health, they have a lot of potential problems.
Aside from the financial burden of having to pay extra vet bills, the emotional cost of owning a French Bulldog as a family pet must be taken into account. This will not be a healthy dog, and may cause some degree of upset for your family.
You could say the French Bulldog price is twofold, financial and emotional.
For most families, the lifelong discomfort of most Frenchies is a deal breaker.
If you have your heart set on owning a French Bulldog, then why not rescue a Frenchie?
Whilst an older French Bulldog will still have some of the veterinary needs of their younger friends, you will at least have some idea of the extent of the severity of their problems when you bring them home.
Frenchie adoption should be an attractive option if you have your heart set on this breed. French Bulldog adoption takes a little bit away from the practice of supporting breeders and so is a relatively good thing.

By rescuing an older French Bulldog you will get the breed your heart desires, without adding to the trade in brachycephalic pets.
French Bulldogs are a popular breed so they shouldn’t be difficult to find. However, it is so important to avoid buying a French Bulldog from puppy mills and pet shops. Pet shops will in all likelihood source their dogs from farm.
Puppy farms are a blight on society and make a profit by raising dogs in terrible conditions. Both the parents and pups have a terrible life and may come with a whole host of health and socialization problems.
As you’ve already read, Frenchies don’t need any more bad luck with their health.
If you are wondering what the best way to find a Frenchie is, consult our puppy search guide.
If you have already brought your puppy home, then you will need to take special care of him.
Make sure you have regular appointments with your vet to check their breathing.
Do not exercise him on hot days, walk too far and always watch his tongue.
Pup’s tongues are a good clue to their breathing difficulties. They should lie flat. If they curl up at the tip then they are struggling.
Caring for a vulnerable French Bulldog puppy is a big responsibility. There are some great guides in our Puppy Care Section to help you with all aspects of puppy care and training.
There are several factors that contribute to French Bulldog price. More popular dogs get higher prices, because people are prepared to pay them.
But Frenchies are also pricey because it’s not easy to breed them. They often cannot birth naturally, and this operation is costly.
If the breeder health tests and feeds the puppies on high quality food, this will also contribute to the price.
Frenchie price isn’t just a financial thing. The emotional cost of raising and caring for a defective breed can be staggering.
One way to potentially reduce the chances of some Frenchie health issues is to consider a mix.
Whether your mix will be healthier is partially down to what they are crossed with.
But there is a fair amount of chance in there too.
Make sure you get to know your potential cross breed well before making your choice.
Here’s how the Frenchie fares in comparison with other breeds.
Frenchies are regularly compared with other similar breeds. Here are some popular options that potential owners consider comparing.
The issue here is that all of these breeds are brachycephalic. Their shortened skulls causing many of them horrible health problems.
You would be right to worry about this breed’s health concerns. Let’s look at some personable breeds with fewer health defects.

Hi, a great informative article full of some very good advice. It’s a shame about the breeding of the Frenchie though.

We have french bulldog puppies for sale.The French Bulldog’s motto is “Love the one you’re with.” He is small, with distinctive “bat ears,” and comes in a variety of colors. The Frenchie is adaptable to any home environment, as long as it has air conditioning.

I love Frenchie but we need good people to breed them like in the one’s in 1905. The boxer’s went through the samething it’s a shame.

Hi Tammy,
Would you be able to advise where you got your 2nd Frenchie from? We are struggling to distinguish between good and bad breeders…
Cheers,
Luke

Hi Luke, If your heart is set on a Frenchie you need to find a breeder who has had both the parents BOAS tested. A good result is Grade 0. They need to have a protruding tail, wide open nostrils and a longer than average muzzle. Steer away from breeders that use terms such as ‘normal for the breed’, as normal in this breed is unfortunately not a healthy structure at the moment. Best of luck in your search!

What do you mean by a raw diet?  I have a orange tabby cat which I feed blue buffalo wet and science diet dry which I’ve been told is healthy for him. I am really interested in getting a Frenchie one day and want to feed him a good diet to be healthy

I feel so lucky that my Lola actually looks more like the 1905 French Bulldog than many of today’s. Her nares are much wider open and she’s got pointier ears. I’m pleased to know that her bloodlines may have missed some of the selective breeding.

A nine-year old “pied” Frenchie owns me!  I have been properly trained to walk on HER leash and be properly behaved since she was ten weeks old! She is the ultimate pillow companion, has had no health problems and is the perfect dog for someone who wants unparalled devotion. She’s a seasoned traveler, is a card-carrying EAD and is obedience trained with some hand signals under her belt. I attribute this fortunate situation to having gotten her from a conscientious breeder who researches every breeding. The Frenchie breed is a magnificent example of how to acquire the ideal lap companion with intelligence, humor and devoted loyalty!

Thank you for this article, we have just rescued an 11 month old. Knowing full well that he is going to have problems, he licks his paws he scratches his face. He never complains or wingers but we know it is uncomfortable for him. We love him but he breaks our heart. I don’t think they should be allowed to keep breeding them especially now knowing it isn’t even a natural birth. We are cruel to keep forcing these wonderful creatures into this world.

I totally agree, there are breeders out there that are destroying the breed and producing dogs that will suffer through life just because some people find a flat face adorable. As a breeder of French bulldogs, I strive to produce a happy medium. Cuteness without a totally flat face.

Be prepared to adopt a “two year old child” instantly. These dogs require the attention, time, and financial burden of a two year old child. With that being said, they are the most amusing, fun, and lovable of all the dog breeds.

Hi my frenchie is 4 months old. She is adorable.  She has developed lines on top of her head that look like hair loss ? Is this normal or could it be skin infection ?

I read because they carry the blue gene that cause skin illness

My frenchie who is now 8 months comes running with me most days, only about 2 miles. Do you think keeping her fit will help avoid breathing problems etc, she thoughly enjoys it & I would take her with me when it is hot.
Bea says

Sorry message should read “would not take her with me if it was hot”

I have a beautiful fawn frenchie he is 5 months old, I have him trained from about 9 weeks to sit,lie,give his paw, leave treats until I tell him and also toilet trained. He is the most loveable and funny little dog with a great temperament and personality I absolutely adore him .

You mentioned that if you don’t want to show your French Bulldog that color shouldn’t matter.  There is a reason that certain colors are not allowed.
Black and white with no trace of brindle carries the deaf gene and can produce blue eyed dogs with eye problems.
Liver or chocolate produces yellow eyed dogs which can cause early blindness and juvenile cataracts.
Blue produces yellow or green eyed dogs which can develop blindness.  The blue color produces dogs with follicular dysplasia, which is gradual hair loss causing dry scaly skin susceptible to bacterial infections. There is no cure, and the condition becomes increasingly worse.  Just because a blue puppy with yellow eyes can see now and has good skin doesn’t mean it won’t lose its sight and develop skin problems later.
I hope this information is helpful.  I did lots of research before getting my french bulldog, and the reason certain colors were not allowed was particularly interesting to me.  I have a wonderful five year old french bulldog that I adore.

My Frenchie is very active and loves to run! However, in the summer, we, of course, limit that 😉  And knock on wood, he has been healthy and he is now 3. I do have to give him an antacid for some mild reflux, but he is a very happy and healthy boy!
I have also discovered that there are many Frenchies who do agility and some have won MACH awards. But some Frenchies are more laid back and are more stocky, etc and are more lap dogs.
I think one has to do their homework, heavily research and select a breeder that is ethical and has healthy puppies and dogs. A good breeder will never shy away from health questions. It’s a big investment and if any breeder seems offended by many questions posed to them, move on!!!
Frenchies are wonderful, loving, smart, funny dogs. I’m head over heels for mine. But, yes, I definitely believe that you have to raise them properly (as any dog) and imho, must either work from home or be at home their first year of life. I worked at home his 1st year and it was great to be there in order to train him and give him the attention that all puppies deserve and need. <3

I have a 2 yr old brindle that has had nares surgery & soft palate surgery. He would often throw up after eating or drinking. I was told that was normal. It is not normal @ all. He still struggles with breathing, even on mild weather days he can’t walk far. Not to mention the allergies that are now showing up in him. Another common frenchie factor. He has a one of a kind personality & we love our Gus but with sinuc problems myself I feel for him.
Pippa says

Sorry to hear of Gus’s troubles, these are lovely dogs and they deserve better – we wish him well  🙂

French Bulldogs are now experiencing a high rate of brain tumor/ cancers.  Life span 4-6 years.  Highest vet bills and most frequent visitor to,a,vet.
