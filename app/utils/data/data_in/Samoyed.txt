Samoyeds have strong instincts to hunt and herd. As a result, they often enjoy chasing cats and other small animals. If you want to live with both a samoyed and a cat, the dog will probably require training and supervision.
Samoyeds have strong instincts to hunt and herd. As a result, they often enjoy chasing cats and other small animals. If you want to live with both a samoyed and a cat, the dog will probably require training and supervision.
The samoyed breed developed as a working dog in Siberia, and herding reindeer numbered among its tasks. Today‚Äôs samoyeds love running after smaller animals, including cats. Because of their instinct to chase, they should never be allowed off-leash, and during walks you might have to resist being dragged in your dog‚Äôs wake as he charges after a chipmunk or rabbit. Your samoyed also could be capable of bothering and even harming your cat, unless you provide adequate training and supervision.
Samoyed puppies who grow up with cats often learn to coexist well with their feline counterparts. You may need to provide some guidance as the dog grows, however, because samoyeds often don't know their own strength and may play too roughly. If you want to add a samoyed or a cat to a home where the other one already lives, introduce them carefully, over a period of days and under close supervision. If you see any signs of aggression or discomfort from either, separate them and try reintroducing them again later.
Samoyeds become extremely destructive when they‚Äôre bored. They look for other ways to entertain themselves, including pestering your cat. You can help head off problems by making sure your samoyed gets exercise every day and by keeping him mentally stimulated; teach him new tricks or attend a training class with him. Closely supervise the animals when you‚Äôre home, and when you‚Äôre gone, avoid leaving your samoyed alone with the cat. Enclosing them securely in separate rooms greatly diminishes the chance of a conflict. Make sure the dog understands you want him to get along with the cat. Samoyeds are eager to please, and they‚Äôre smart and sensitive enough to know when their people are upset by their behavior.
Samoyeds love being part of a pack or family and dislike being alone. They‚Äôre very affectionate and usually get along well with children, as long as the kids treat them with respect. Again, though, the dog may be unaware of how much stronger she is, so you should always supervise her when she‚Äôs around children. Samoyeds can be trained to live with smaller pets, such as rabbits or ferrets, but as with cats, you shouldn‚Äôt ever leave them unsupervised. Because of their pack orientation, samoyeds often live particularly well with other dogs.

A breed standard is the guideline which describes the ideal characteristics, temperament and appearance including the correct colour of a breed and ensures that the breed is fit for function. Absolute soundness is essential. Breeders and judges should at all times be careful to avoid obvious conditions or exaggerations which would be detrimental in any way to the health, welfare or soundness of this breed.
From time to time certain conditions or exaggerations may be considered to have the potential to affect dogs in some breeds adversely, and judges and breeders are requested to refer to the Breed Watch information related to this breed for details of any such current issues. If a feature or quality is desirable it should only be present in the right measure. However, if a dog possesses a feature, characteristic or colour described as unacceptable, it must not be rewarded in the show ring.

During this time the females start to attract males. You can notice by swelling vulva and bloody discharge.
The second part is the Estrus when the female is receptive for the male. It lasts for about 3 to 11 days.
The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color.
The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the female‚Äôs discharge changes for vivid red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating.
The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts about six months.

Samoyed is a true working dog breed originally bred for hunting, herding, and shedding, but as they are besides being intelligent, and hardy are also social caring and affectionate they can make an excellent companion dog for the family using their abilities to entertain and protect the children.
Their name comes from the Samoyede, which is the name of semi-nomadic people from Asia who migrated to Siberia approximately a thousand years ago. The members of these dark-skin semi-nomadic tribes treated their dogs as family members with love and affection, sharing their table and bed with them. They usually slept inside the tents with the people because in this area, which is the coldest habitable place on earth the temperature can easily go below minus 60 degrees. These people developed a love and understanding of humankind and an unfailing sense of trust and loyalty in their dogs which remained a part of their character today. Due to the interdependence of their survival on each other, a very special human-dog association evolved. Reindeers were an essential source of food leather and fur for the Samoyed. At first, the dogs were used as hunters, fishers, and guarders. They also hauled the sleds when it was impossible or unnecessary to use the reindeer, the general draught animal. The task later shifted from hunting to herding the reindeers.
During the late 1800s, the breed began to arrive in Europe especially to England, but not so much of them However, not all of the early imports were the unmixed white breed which is common today. One of these early imports was gifted to Queen Alexandra, who took a great part in the promotion of the breed. The first American Samoyed, named Moustan of Argenteau was registered with the AKC in 1906. It was a ¬†Russian import, finding its way to the United States as a gift from Grand Duke Nicolas.
In the early 20th century lot of Samoyedes, which were imported to Europe and America were brought to the famous Antarctic expeditions by the mushers of the time for example Scott, Shackleton, and Amundsen knowing that these animals are enthusiastic hauler of supplies, capable of sledding one and a half times their own weight. These valorous dogs endured terrible hardships serving these explorers, only a few returned.

In general this seems OK, but Samoyeds are no guard dogs, at least that's what I heard every Samoyed owner say so far. They say that they are way too friendly to everyone. I apologize for a low rank, but I feel like this needs to be said.

Originally intended to be a working dog, the Samoyed has all the qualities you‚Äôd expect in this type of dog. Not only is it alert and strong, it is happy, trusting, loyal, hardworking, gentle, and playful. On top of all that, this is one incredibly beautiful dog.

Wonderful companions for a variety of households, Samoyeds possess great watchdog abilities and are amazing with children. Read on to learn more about this breed.

Wonderful companions for a variety of households, Samoyeds possess great watchdog abilities and are amazing with children.


An ancient Russian breed that originated in Siberia (one of the harshest environments in the world), Samoyeds were used for sledding, herding, guarding and keeping their owners warm. These dogs were kept by a native tribe to ancient Siberia known as the Samoyeds. The Samoyeds were used to pull sleds, herd reindeer, and hunt animals ‚Äì including the polar bear. Even though it is largely used as a companion dog today, it still retains many of the traits that made it a staple in Siberia.

Recent DNA analysis of the Samoyed has proved that this breed is one of the 14 most ancient dog breeds.

The Samoyed was recognized by the AKC in 1906.


Samoyeds do well on a raw diet, which is no surprise, as its ancestors were used for hunting. Even if you go the dry dog food route, feel free to throw your dog some extra meat and even a real bone to chew on. As well, your Samoyed may enjoy raw fruits and vegetables.

An excellent companion dog, the Samoyed loves being around people.


Be warned: undertaking the training of a Samoyed is not for the faint of heart. You‚Äôll need more than skill to train this intelligent and independent dog. Don‚Äôt get us wrong ‚Äì of course it is possible, but it will take a lot of time, patience and consistency in order to be successful. You do have something going in your favor ‚Äì the Samoyeds are eager to please. It will take a firm hand to train them and this breed does need consequences of its actions, so use positive reinforcement and praise as part of the training process. It‚Äôs important to make it fun and energetic for your dog, since it can be somewhat resistant to obedience training.

You must always make sure you keep the upper hand at all times during the training process. That way, your position as alpha is understood and unchallenged. Since it is a pack dog, the Samoyed will be happiest once it knows its position in the pack.

Start training your Samoyed early and your life with this dog will run a lot smoother. It‚Äôs also a great way to stop bad habits such as barking, chewing, jumping up, nipping, and grabbing onto objects.


Male Samoyeds weigh 45 to 65 pounds, while females weigh 35 to 50 pounds.

An excellent companion dog, the Samoyed loves being around people. This breed is great with children and needs lots of attention and affection. The Samoyed will not do well if it is left alone for long periods of time. The breed suffers from separation anxiety and is known to act out as a result of being away from its family (this includes destructive chewing and incessant barking). So if you work full time outside of the home, this is not the breed for you.

Since this is a herding dog, you‚Äôll have to watch for instincts such as nipping at your children‚Äôs heels. Your Samoyed will also chase cats, deer, and livestock if given the opportunity to do so. It‚Äôs a natural instinct to them and a very difficult to break.

Even though it is an intelligent dog, the Samoyed can be difficult to train. You should use consistent training methods and make sure the whole family is onboard in order to provide a unified front. As well as using treats for good behavior, make sure that there are consequences for bad behavior.


The most common health problems known to affect the Samoyeds include hip dysplasia, cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetes. Hip dysplasia affects the hips and can range in severity from moderate to severe pain. If left untreated, cataracts may lead to blindness, as will glaucoma, and diabetes is often known to reduce the lifespan of the Samoyed.


Samoyeds have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years.


A working dog by nature and ancestry the Samoyed needs to be kept busy. Be sure that your Samoyed gets plenty of exercise, as it helps it stay healthy and happy and it helps relieve some of the pent up energy. The more energy it uses up, the less of the impact of separation anxiety and destructive habits. The Samoyed is quite strong, as it used to pull sleds and hunt polar bears, so be careful when playing with this breed.

Even though it is an intelligent dog, the Samoyed can be difficult to train.


The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: ‚ÄúA hardy and eager worker, the Samoyed is known for black lips that curl slightly at the corners into the ‚ÄúSamoyed smile.‚Äù Bright and alert, he likes to stay busy and enjoys participating in agility, herding, weight pulling, sledding, pack hiking, conformation shows and more! His heavy, weather resistant coat is suitable for very cold climates and should be pure white, white and biscuit, cream or biscuit.‚Äù


The beautiful white coat that Samoyeds are known for is a double coat. The long course outer coat is made up of hairs that protect the undercoat and keep it clean. The short, dense undercoat offers warmth. Weather resistant, the Samoyed typically blows a coat or sheds twice a year. The Samoyed‚Äôs coat coloring is either white or biscuit, or a mixture of the two.

Proper grooming is a high maintenance ritual, but necessary. When grooming your Samoyed, divide the hair into sections, combing first, and then brushing in order to achieve the best results.


You can‚Äôt resist these adorable balls of white fur, but even though they are cute, be warned that it is going to grow into a powerful adult. Start training early in order to control and eliminate bad habits and to establish your role as the alpha in the pack.

As dog parents, we love sharing pictures and stories of our pups. After all, we all have the cutest, most adorable dog. Right? Sometimes these stories are funny, share special heartfelt moments, and sometimes these posts are sad stories that tug at our hearts. Curious about this range of emotions, Protect My Paws recently analyzed the content in nearly a quarter of a million dog-themed tweets. From here, they identified the 10 dog breeds that make us the happiest ‚Äì and the results were surprising!To analyze and understand the emotions connected to each tweet in the study, they used the NRC Lexicon. This tool looks at the entire sentence, scanning it for recognizable emotional words and phrases. This included happy, sad, fearful, and trustful phrases.The result was a breakdown of which dog breeds associated with each emotion, and the results were surprising. While you may have expected to see German Shepherd Dogs among the most trustworthy or Golden Retrievers topping the dogs that make us feel the happiest, you may be shocked. The breeds that made this list stray from the usual stereotypes.So, what dogs make us the happiest?The study found that the little black furball known as the Affenpinscher was happily talked about the most on social media! This breed may only weigh between 7 and 13 lbs. fully grown, but they are full of personality. They are described as being feisty, inquisitive, stubborn, and humorous. Of the 200k tweets analyzed, 240 ‚Äújoyful‚Äù words were identified per 1000 related to the Affenpinscher.Other dog breeds on this happiest list included:Staffordshire Bull Terrier (207)Vizsla (194)West Highland White Terrier (192)Portuguese Water Dog (185)Bullmastiff (183)Chesapeake Bay Retriever (184)Samoyed (176)American Staffordshire Terrier (175)English Cocker Spaniel (174)

Have you ever wondered just how smart your cat truly is? Do you wonder if their personality reflects their breed or coat type (tortie parents, I‚Äôm looking at you)? Now, you can learn more about your best friend while contributing to groundbreaking research that aims to answer that very question!Researchers at the University of Maine at Farmington‚Äôs Maine Cat Lab are conducting the first-ever international study of cat intelligence, and they‚Äôre looking for cat parents like you to participate.This one-of-a-kind study, led by psychology professor Karol Maybury and university library manager Bryce Cundick, seeks to better understand cat personalities and smarts on a global scale. Unlike dogs, which have been the subject of numerous intelligence studies, cats have been largely overlooked in this area.‚ÄúWe wanted to see, could we take the same metric that we use or people personality,‚Äù Cundick explained. ‚ÄúDoes it translate over to cat personality?‚ÄùThe current phase of the study involves a 10-item online questionnaire that explores different aspects of your cat‚Äôs intelligence, including memory, problem-solving, attention span, emotional intelligence, and gained knowledge. Pet parents are asked to evaluate their cats‚Äô behaviors through a series of questions, and in return, they will receive an IQ score between 7 and 70, which then sorts your cat into one of six tiers:Tier 1: The Cheshire Cat Dreamer (7-19Tier 2: The Garfield Gourmand (20-32)Tier 3: The Tom Tactician (33-45)Tier 4: The Bagheera Sleuth (46-55)Tier 5: The Felix Forecaster (56-65)Tier 6: The McGonagall Mastermind (66-70)So far, the researchers have gathered over 5000 responses from cat owners worldwide. Among them were Ryan Ham and his fianc√© Hannah Gagnon, who participated with their Ragdoll, Gobi.‚ÄúMy cat‚Äôs IQ score is 35. ‚ÄòPersistent and crafty, these cats are like Tom from ‚ÄúTom and Jerry.‚Äù While their plans don‚Äôt always work out, their sheer determination and ability to think on their paws make them formidable,‚Äô‚Äù Ham read from the survey results, recognizing Gobi in the description.
If you‚Äôve ever watched your dog sleep, you might have noticed them twitching, whimpering, or even paddling their legs as if they were running. It‚Äôs easy to wonder - are they dreaming? And if so, could they be having nightmares?The idea of dogs experiencing nightmares is fascinating, and while we can‚Äôt ask them directly, there‚Äôs plenty of evidence to suggest that they do, in fact, dream just like we do. But what exactly happens when a dog has a bad dream, and should you be concerned? Let‚Äôs take a closer look.Do Dogs Dream?Scientists believe that dogs, like humans, go through different sleep cycles, including REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. This is the stage of sleep when most  dreaming occurs. Research on brain activity in sleeping dogs has shown that their sleep patterns are strikingly similar to ours, which suggests that they likely dream as well.In fact, studies on rats have demonstrated that these small animals replay activities from their waking hours in their dreams. Since dogs have even more complex brains than rats, it‚Äôs highly likely that they also relive experiences in their sleep - both good and bad.What Do Dogs Dream About?Though we can‚Äôt say for certain, experts believe dogs dream about their daily experiences. Your dog might dream about chasing a ball, going for a walk, or interacting with people and other animals. A hunting breed might dream of tracking prey, while a herding dog could be rounding up imaginary sheep in its sleep.Because dogs process emotions much like humans do, it‚Äôs also possible that they dream about stressful or frightening experiences. If your pup had a rough day at the vet or encountered an aggressive dog at the park, those moments might play out in their dreams.Can Dogs Have Nightmares?Yes, dogs can have nightmares. Just as happy moments can appear in their dreams, so can fears and anxieties. If you‚Äôve ever seen your dog whimper, growl, or suddenly jolt awake from sleep, it‚Äôs possible they were having a bad dream.Common triggers for nightmares in dogs might include past trauma (especially in rescue dogs),  loud noises like fireworks or thunderstorms, or stressful situations they‚Äôve recently experienced. A dog that has had negative interactions with other animals or humans may also relive those moments in their sleep.Should You Wake a Dog from a Nightmare?It‚Äôs tempting to wake up a dog that seems distressed in their sleep, but it‚Äôs usually best to let them wake up on their own. Suddenly waking a dog from a deep sleep, especially during a nightmare, can startle them, causing them to react instinctively by snapping or growling.If your dog frequently has nightmares and appears very distressed, you can try gently calling their name from a distance to wake them gradually. Avoid touching them abruptly, as this can be disorienting.How to Help a Dog That Has Frequent NightmaresIf your dog seems to have bad dreams often, there are a few things you can do to help:
You might enjoy decking the halls with boughs of holly, but would that be a smart thing to do if you happen to share your home with a dog? The glossy green leaves and bright red berries are a Christmas staple, but unfortunately, holly is not safe for dogs. Holly is considered toxic to dogs, and taking precautions is essential to keep your furry companion safe. Here‚Äôs what every dog owner should know about this iconic holiday plant.Why Is Holly Toxic to Dogs?Holly contains saponins ‚Äî a group of chemicals that are mildly to moderately toxic to dogs. Both the leaves and berries of the holly plant pose a risk if ingested. Additionally, holly berries contain other harmful substances, such as methylxanthines and cyanogens, which can worsen symptoms of poisoning. To complicate matters, holly leaves are spiky, and their sharp edges can irritate a dog‚Äôs mouth, throat, and stomach.Symptoms of Holly Poisoning in DogsIf your dog ingests holly, the symptoms can vary depending on their size, health, and how much was consumed. Common signs to watch for include:Vomiting: Your dog may vomit shortly after eating holly, expelling any berries or leaves they ingested.Drooling: Irritation caused by holly‚Äôs toxins or prickly leaves can lead to excessive drooling.Diarrhea: Digestive upset is a common response to holly poisoning.Lethargy: A poisoned dog might appear unusually tired or sluggish.Mouth Irritation: Cuts or bleeding in your dog‚Äôs mouth can indicate they‚Äôve chewed holly leaves.Loss of Appetite: Gastrointestinal discomfort can discourage your dog from eating.What to Do If Your Dog Eats HollyIf your dog consumes holly, staying calm is crucial. Panic can make it harder to handle the situation effectively. Follow these steps:Remove the Holly: Safely dispose of any remaining holly or place it well out of reach. If your dog is still chewing the plant, gently remove it from their mouth.Assess Symptoms: Observe your dog closely for any of the symptoms mentioned above.Contact Your Vet: Even if symptoms seem mild, consult your veterinarian or call a pet poison control hotline. Provide details about how much holly was consumed, the type of plant, and any symptoms your dog is showing. Do not induce vomiting unless explicitly directed by a vet, as this can sometimes cause additional harm.Encourage Hydration: Offer your dog plenty of fresh water to help flush toxins from their system.Prevention is KeyThe best way to protect your dog from holly poisoning is to avoid using real holly in your holiday decorations. Consider these alternatives and precautions:Opt for Artificial Holly: High-quality  artificial holly looks just as festive and is completely pet-safe. Plus, it can be reused year after year.

It‚Äôs convenient, easy to store, and quite frankly the quality these days is leaps and bounds over what it used to be. Between breed-specific, grain-free, all-natural, and large breed versus small breed options, the pet food industry has certainly stepped up to the plate on this one.However many pet owners still opt for wet food. Whether it‚Äôs out of a tin or it's a special, home-cooked recipe, wet food is a great solution for super picky eaters as well as older or ailing pets who may need the added hydration. It can also be the only choice for elderly dogs or cats who struggle to eat hard foods due to dental issues/loss of teeth.Yet unlike a large bag of kibble that will last for several weeks if not months, wet food has a definite shelf life and needs to be stored properly once opened. Again, manufacturers have embraced the challenge and developed easy, effective ways to keep our wet pet food fresh and safe, for our hungry fur crews.

Christmas is just around the corner, and you‚Äôre probably busy decorating your beautiful holiday tree. Dangling ornaments, neatly wrapped presents, twinkling garlands, and sparkling lights all contribute to the festive magic ‚Äî but for dog owners, these delights can quickly turn into a disaster. One curious glance from your mischievous pup can send the entire tree into chaos. So how can you protect both your tree and your furry friend? Here are some practical tips to keep your holiday season merry and stress-free.1. Choose the Right LocationBefore you even start decorating, consider where to place your tree. Choosing the right spot can significantly reduce the chances of canine chaos. Ideally, place your Christmas tree in a room or corner where you can control your dog‚Äôs access. If possible, use a  dog barrier or keep the tree in a space that can be closed off with doors. This simple step can provide an extra layer of protection and prevent unsupervised ‚Äúinteractions.‚Äù
As loving dog parents, we want to ensure our pups are getting the best of the best ‚Äì including the best toys, the most comfortable beds, and, of course, the best nutrition. But with so many dog food brands on the market, deciding which ones truly deliver on their promises can be overwhelming.A recent study has shed light on this very issue. By analyzing a massive amount of market feedback and online customer reviews, it highlights which brands are earning ‚Äì and losing ‚Äì the trust of dog parents.  Reviews.ai, a consumer data analysis firm, recently published their Dry Dog Food Report 2025 ‚Äì Best Seller Performance. It analyzed over 135,000 online customer reviews from 2024, covering 26 pet food brands and 89 specific dry dog food products. The report painted a clear picture of what brands are meeting the expectations of dog lovers across the country and which brands are falling short. The report sorted the pet food brands into four main performance groups: LeadersBrands with high customer satisfaction and strong loyalty. These brands consistently received positive reviews, revealing that dog parents were satisfied not only by the products but also by the brands responsible for them. Examples include: ¬†Purina, Hill‚Äôs, Iams, Nutro, Royal Canin, and Rachel Ray Nutrish.NicheThese are smaller companies that have a strong customer sentiment. Brands in this group cater to specific needs or preferences and, in doing so, have built a strong, loyal customer base. Examples include: Merrick, Pedigree, Health Extension, and Natural Balance.At RiskDespite having high visibility, brands in this group were found to have declining customer trust. These brands face challenges related to customer satisfaction and loyalty, which may suggest potential issues with their products or brand practices. Examples include; Blue Buffalo, Taste of the Wild, Orijen, and Open Farm.LaggardsBrands in this group were found to have low engagement and poor consumer sentiment. They are experiencing significant difficulties in building and maintaining customer trust and satisfaction. Examples include: Signature, Diamond Naturals, Cesar, Canidae, and Wagg.So, what do these rankings really mean? What decides which group each pet food brand is sorted into? Researchers combed through a wealth of market research and customer review data, focusing on the feedback provided on various online retailer websites. The rankings were based solely on the feedback offered by dog parents. In addition to sorting the brands into four categories, the report also revealed that nearly all reviews could be sorted into six primary areas of concern: Dog Preference and Satisfaction: Many pet parents shared frustration with dogs rejecting food due to taste, smell, or texture. Dog Health and Wellness: Pet Parents showed a higher level of loyalty to brands that had strong veterinarian endorsements and clear nutritional health benefits.Brand and Trust: Pet parents are increasingly skeptical and desire brand transparency. Frequent formula or ingredient changes and the use of vague marketing terms can lead to a loss of trust. Product and Experience: Some of the most common complaints seen in reviews included packaging issues, formula changes without notice, and inconsistent food quality. Price and Purchase: Looking behind the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù label, pet parents are carefully weighing price vs quality to find the best option for their pets while keeping to their budgets. Service and Fulfillment: When making a purchase, pet parents want to receive their products in a timely fashion. Their opinions can be influenced by delays resulting from slow delivery times and stock shortages. They may also drop due to poor customer support. This research highlights the importance of doing your own research and due diligence when choosing the best food for your best friend. Most importantly, the best dog food is the one that meets your pup‚Äôs individual needs (and preferences). By staying informed and paying attention to changes in the pet food industry as well as to your dog‚Äôs response to their food, you can make the best decision for their health and happiness.

A dog‚Äôs gut health plays a vital role in their overall well-being, impacting digestion, immunity, and even behavior. When the digestive system is unbalanced, it can lead to a range of health issues that diminish a dog‚Äôs quality of life. Recognizing the signs of poor gut health allows pet owners to take timely action to ensure their furry companions remain healthy and happy.Digestive Issues: The Most Obvious SignDigestive disturbances are often the first indicators of gut health problems. Common symptoms include:Diarrhea: Frequent loose or watery stools may indicate an imbalance in gut bacteria,  food intolerance, or an infection.Constipation: Difficulty passing stool or producing hard, dry feces can suggest dehydration, lack of  fiber, or gastrointestinal sluggishness.Vomiting: Occasional vomiting may not be concerning, but frequent or persistent vomiting warrants veterinary attention.Excessive Gas: Frequent flatulence, especially with a strong odor, suggests poor digestion or bacterial imbalance.

I admit that these days, my 13- and 15-year-old Schnoodles are less inclined to get excited when I pick up their leash than they were just a couple of years back. So, their outings are shorter and treats are doled out as a reward for making the effort when we return home.But there‚Äôs so much more to your pet‚Äôs aging than just a slower gait and desire to curl up and snooze away the afternoon. Vision starts to fade, hearing is not quite so acute and often, their teeth and gums begin to cause problems.That said, every so often we see the puppy come out when they get excited about something special ‚Äì a high-value treat, another dog, your return from work, or a fun new toy that he can still enjoy despite his physical limitations. And those are the moments we want to continue creating by adapting their arsenal of playthings to meet their changing needs.
Declawing cats has now become illegal in Massachusetts, thanks to a law that was signed by Governor Maura Healey. Titled ‚ÄúAn Act Prohibiting Inhumane Feline Declawing,‚Äù the law bans the procedure in the state. Those who violate the law can face fines or be subject to discipline.
Have you ever noticed how your dog seems to know your voice even when they can‚Äôt see you? Do you wonder if they actually know it‚Äôs their human calling or if they just assume it‚Äôs you because you‚Äôre in your shared home? A new study from Hungary suggests that your dog may actually recognize your voice. In fact, they may be able to recognize the voices of each of their family members. The study, published in Animal Behavior, aimed to find out if a dog could distinguish between different voices ‚Äì not only between familiar and unfamiliar voices but also between the voices of different family members. ‚ÄúPrevious studies demonstrated that dogs are sensitive to certain acoustic cues in the human voice, they can recognize the sex of the speaker and distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar voices,‚Äù explained Kinga Suranyi, Ph.D. student at the ELTE Department of Ethology. ‚ÄúWhether dogs are capable of voice-based individual-level recognition of humans had not been demonstrated before this experiment. To do this, they invited 31 dogs to participate, and with each dog, three different family members. One at a time, a pre-recorded speech made by one of the owners was played through the loudspeakers. The three owners sat in a row, not speaking, gesturing, or hinting at which person‚Äôs voice the dog was hearing. The dog was then monitored for any signs of recognition. Each dog went through this test 18 times. The results were surprising, with the dogs looking to the person whose voice they were hearing more often than not.
