A common mistake a lot of people make is thinking that all canines hate cats and vice versa. This isn’t true and there are a lot of pet dog breeds that are great with cats. Dogs that aren’t naturally cat friendly can likewise be trained to be safer around felines.

Not all Keeshonds despise felines, some get along with them. When Keeshonds do hate felines, of the most common reason is quite straightforward. Like all canines, Keeshonds still keep a few of the hunting instincts that they were originally bred for. This is why Keeshonds like chasing after all moving things, whether it’s a toy, rodent, or a cat.
Given that the majority of felines will escape when they encounter, it’s easy to see why they are understood for not being friendly with each other. Keeshonds really delight in chasing after cats not due to the fact that they dislike them, but generally since a fast running animal sets off a strong, natural impulse to chase after overcomes any training or socialisation.


Teaching your Keeshond to quit going after felines takes time, practice and consistency, but the reward of not needing to stress over them always going after is well worth it. Here are the steps of how to stop your Keeshond from chasing felines.


The best technique to ensure your Keeshond would never kill a cat is to raise them with cats when they’re a puppy prior to 3 months old. At this age, they will usually wish to play with the cats and will not see them as prey.
If your Keeshond has killed a feline before, its ideal if you keep them in an open, enclosed area. When taking them for walks try to stop going after sunset and before dawn because that’s when cats are most active and likely to be roaming the neighborhoods.

--------------------------------------------------
Breed Standard: A description of the ideal dog of each recognized breed, to serve as an ideal against which dogs are judged at shows, originally laid down by a parent breed club and accepted officially by national or international bodies.
General Appearance: The Keeshond (pronounced kayz-hawnd) is a natural, handsome dog of well-balanced, short-coupled body, attracting attention not only by his coloration, alert carriage, and intelligent expression, but also by his stand-off coat, his richly plumed tail well curled over his back, his foxlike expression, and his small pointed ears. His coat is very thick around the neck, fore part of the shoulders and chest, forming a lion-like ruff-more profuse in the male. His rump and hind legs, down to the hocks, are also thickly coated, forming the characteristic "trousers." His head, ears, and lower legs are covered with thick, short hair.

Size, Proportion, Substance: The Keeshond is a medium-sized, square-appearing, sturdy dog, neither coarse nor lightly made. The ideal height of fully matured dogs when measured from top of withers to the ground is 18 inches for males and 17 inches for bitches - a 1 inch variance either way is acceptable. While correct size is very important, it should not outweigh that of type.
​
Head: Expression - Expression is largely dependent on the distinctive characteristic called "spectacles" - a combination of markings and shadings in the orbital area which must include a delicate, dark line slanting from the outer corner of each eye toward the lower corner of each ear coupled with expressive eyebrows. Markings (or shadings) on face and head must present a pleasing appearance, imparting to the dog an alert and intelligent expression. Very Serious Fault
- Absence of dark lines which form the "spectacles."
​
Eyes - Eyes should be dark brown in color, of medium size, almond shaped, set obliquely and neither too wide apart nor too close together. Eye rims are black. Faults - Round and/or protruding eyes or eyes light of color.

Ears - Ears should be small, triangular in shape, mounted high on head and carried erect. Size should be proportionate to the head-length approximating the distance from the outer corner of the eye to the nearest edge of the ear. Fault - Ears not carried erect when at attention.

Skull - The head should be well-proportioned to the body and wedge-shaped when viewed from above - not only the muzzle, but the whole head should give this impression when the ears are drawn back by covering the nape of the neck and the ears with one hand. Head in profile should exhibit a definite stop. Faults - Apple head or absence of stop.

Muzzle - Of medium length, neither coarse nor snipey, and well-proportioned to the skull. Mouth - The mouth should be neither overshot nor undershot. Lips should be black and closely meeting-not thick, coarse or sagging, and with no wrinkle at the corner of the mouth. Faults - Overshot, undershot or wry mouth. Teeth - The teeth should be white, sound and strong meeting in a scissors bite. Fault - Misaligned teeth.

Neck, Topline, Body: The neck should be moderately long, well-shaped and well set on shoulders. The body should be compact with a short, straight back sloping slightly downward toward the hindquarters: well ribbed, barrel well rounded, short in loin, belly moderately tucked up, deep and strong of chest.

Tail - The tail should be moderately long and well feathered, set on high and tightly curled over the back. It should lie flat and close to the body. The tail must form a part of the "silhouette" of the dog's body, rather than give the appearance of an appendage. Fault - Tail not lying close to the back.
Forequarters - Forelegs should be straight seen from any angle. Pasterns are strong with a slight slope. Legs must be of good bone in proportion to the overall dog. Shoulder to upper arm angulation is between slight to moderate.

Hindquarters - Angulation in rear should be between slight to moderate to complement the forequarters, creating balance and typical gait. Hindquarters are well muscled with hocks perpendicular to the ground.
Feet - The feet should be compact, well rounded, cat-like. Toes are nicely arched, with black nails.

Coat: The body should be abundantly covered with long, straight, harsh hair standing well out from a thick, downy undercoat. Head, including muzzle, skull and ears, should be covered with smooth, soft, short hair-velvety in texture on the ears. The neck is covered with a mane-more profuse in the male-sweeping from under the jaw and covering the whole of the front part of the shoulders and chest, as well as the top part of the shoulders. The hair on the legs should be smooth and short, except for feathering on the front legs and "trousers" on the hind legs. Hind legs should be profusely feathered down to the hocks-not below. The hair on the tail should form a rich plume. Coat must not part down the back. The Keeshond is to be shown in a natural state with trimming permissible only on feet, pasterns, hocks and - if desired - whiskers. Trimming other than as described to be severely penalized. Faults - Silky, wavy, or curly coats. Part in coat down the back.

Color and Markings: A dramatically marked dog, the Keeshond is a mixture of gray, black and cream. This coloration may vary from light to dark. The hair of the outer coat is black tipped, the length of the black tips producing the characteristic shading of color. Puppies are often less intensely marked. The undercoat is very pale gray or cream, never tawny.

Head - The muzzle should be dark in color. "Spectacles" and shadings, as previously described, are characteristic of the breed and must be present to some degree. Ears should be very darkalmost black.
Ruff, Shoulders and "Trousers" - The color of the ruff and "trousers" is lighter than that of the body. The shoulder line markings of light gray must be well defined.

Tail - The plume of the tail is very light in color when curled on the back, and the tip of the tail should be black.

Legs and Feet - Legs and feet are cream.
Faults - Pronounced white markings. Black markings more than halfway down the foreleg, penciling excepted. White foot or feet. Very Serious Faults - Entirely black or white or any solid color; any pronounced deviation from the color as described.

Gait: The distinctive gait of the Keeshond is unique to the breed. Dogs should move boldly and keep tails curled over the back. They should move cleanly and briskly; the movement should be straight and sharp with reach and drive between slight to moderate.
Temperament: Temperament is of primary importance. The Keeshond is neither timid nor aggressive but, instead, is outgoing and friendly with both people and other dogs. The Keeshond is a lively, intelligent, alert and affectionate companion.

Approved November 14, 1989
Effective January 1, 1990
The late Dick Beauchamp, respected dog writer, breeder and judge, once said that head type was one of the hallmarks of breed type. So in exploring the aspects of Keeshond head type we need to examine the wording in the breed standard and apply that to our dogs.
​
Spectacles are the first thing mentioned in the standard. Judges new to the breed often confuse the reference to spectacles as the appearance of light areas around the eyes circled with darker hair – like glasses. However, the standard states that spectacles are not only the orbital area but “the delicate line slanting from the outer corner of each eye toward the lower corner of each ear.” This combined with the eyebrows give the dog an alert and intelligent expression. This is essential to breed type. A dull and lack luster expression are true Keeshond expressions. A very serious fault is the lack of the dark line forming the spectacles.
​
The next descriptors in Keeshond standard have to do with the eyes and the ears. These are hallmarks of true Arctic breed type. Both have practical applications in the arctic environment. Eyes are to be dark brown in color, medium size, almond in shape, set obliquely (at an angle slanting upward) and not too close together or too far apart. One can imagine in an outdoor arctic environment that round, protruding eye would be a disadvantage and round eyes would be more prone to injury. Dark eyes, and eye rims are also required. Why? Arctic breeds are required to “squint down” in the snow. Much easier to do with almond shaped, dark eyes. Faults are round, light or protruding eyes.
​
Ears are required to be small, triangular in shape, and mounted high on the head. There are functional reasons as well for these ear requirements in arctic breeds. You can imagine that large ears would be subject to freezing and the dog would at least lose the tips of the ears in subzero temperatures. The smaller, higher placed ear is also more mobile and alert to the many sounds of the outdoor environment. One test that breeders (not suggested for judges) can do when evaluating puppies or adults is to fold the ear down toward the corner of the eye. The ears should just reach the corner of the eye. If the ear covers the eye it is probably too large.
The standard says that the shape of the head should be in proportion to the body. When viewed from above, not just the muzzle but the whole head should give the appearance of a wedge. Dogs that cheeky, or coarse will not have smooth wedge and there will be a distinct break where the muzzle fits into the back skull. In profile the head should exhibit a definite stop. It is somewhat controversial how much stop, but definite is definite and most would agree that ski slope is not definite. Faults are an apple head, or absence of stop. David Cavill, an English judge and expert on arctic breeds says that the rise of the stop over the nasal sinus is required in arctic breeds as it gives space for the air to warm as dog breathes in the colder climates. One can imagine the difficulty that a brachycephalic breed would have in this challenging and very cold climate.
The muzzle is called to be of medium length, neither coarse nor snippy. Bitches, of course, will have more delicate muzzles than dogs. Once illustration of a beautiful Keeshond head is the portrait of Eng. Ch. Furstin of Evenlode, her muzzle is delicate but strong and fits into a smooth wedge. The mouth is called to be neither overshot nor undershot and lips should be black with no wrinkle or sagging. A scissors bite is called for and a fault is misaligned teeth.

Collection of all the general dog breed info about Keeshond so you can get to know the breed more.
Inbreeding is common because of its popularity. A new study suggests that inbreeding contributes to the incidence of disease and health problems.
The Keeshond is one of the top breeds in the dog intelligence ranking.
This breed's emotional level reflects their owner's feelings and they don't handle punishments well.
The main triggers for barking are fear, attention, alarm, boredom, greeting, separation anxiety, compulsive barking, and defense.
Low  🔽
Between 200 and 400 PSI  ⏺
The Keeshond, and many others, have a fearsome presence because they have significant jaw strength, so it is important not to anger the dog and have it around strangers until it is fully trained.
However, they are usually quite calm and good companions, they work well in families and are easy to care for.
In conclusion, while the Keeshond bite force is certainly an interesting aspect of the breed, it is important not to let it overshadow the many other reasons why these dogs are so loved and respected. With proper training and socialization, a Keeshond can be a loyal and protective companion for your family.
Do Keeshond dogs need a lot of exercises?
If you notice any weight gain, consult your veterinarian and make a diet plan. Reduce unhealthy food and snacks, and measure the Keeshond weight regularly.
Regular brushed dog's coat is less likely to shed. Ears and eyes should be cleaned often to avoid infections.
Check the local pet store for dog grooming supplies and find the best dog shampoo to keep its coat healthy and to give your Keeshond a pleasant experience of a dog bath.
If you don't have the time, skill, or money to take care of your Keeshond, search for the best dog groomer or clipping service in your area and book an appointment.
If you notice any change in your dog's drooling habit, you should contact a vet as soon as possible.
Medium  ⏺
Bathing will wash away your dog’s natural oils, while a simple brushing every few days should keep them clean.

60-64 days
During this time the females start to attract males. You can notice by swelling vulva and bloody discharge.
The second part is the Estrus when the female is receptive for the male. It lasts for about 3 to 11 days.
The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color.
The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the female’s discharge changes for vivid red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating.
The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts about six months.
Once a year.
The Keeshond is a medium-sized dog with a plus, two-layer coat of silver and black fur with a ruff and a curled tail. It was developed in Holland, and its closest relatives are the German spitzes such as the Large Spitz, Miniature Spitz, or Pomeranian.

The Keeshond's exact origin is unknown, but it is thought to have descended from ancient canine strains that produced other Spitz breeds.
The development of the breed is believed to have occurred in the 17th century in Holland, and paintings as well as the written word support this timeline and place.
Although at the time, the breed was known as the Wolfspitz in Germany, the Chien Loup in France, and the Lupini in Italy and it took years before the Keeshond would be known by the name we call it today.
By the 18th century, The Keeshond was used as a watchdog and companion on small boats called Rijinakens that cruised on the Rhine River, earning its nickname the “barge dog”.
Furthermore, a political insurrection led by Cornelis de Gyselaer, a Keeshond fancier and the leader of the Dutch rebellion, occurred in the 18th century in Holland.
His dog, known as Kees, became a symbol of the Dutch patriot when he was being represented in so many political pamphlets, caricatures, and handouts.
The breed was later given the name "Keeshond," with "Kees" standing for Gyzelaar and "hond" for a dog in Dutch. De Gyzelaar didn’t mind as he believed the breed reflected the Patriot party's strength, and he was likely pleased when the Keeshond became the party's official mascot.
Unfortunately for the breed, the rebellion against the House of Orange failed. It caused many Keeshond owners to abandon, or even worse, to destroy and kill their dogs out of fear that they would be identified as participants of the failed insurrection.
To make matters worse, riverboats were getting bigger, and the need for the Keeshond decreased. The breed might have gone extinct entirely if it weren’t for a few farmers, peasants, and river men who saved and preserved the dogs.

In the 1920s, Baroness van Hardenbroek became involved in the effort to save the species, and it was considered a huge success.
Within ten years, the Keeshond had grown in popularity to the point that the Dutch Keeshond Club was formed. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1930, and it is now the national dog of Holland.
Overall, the breed is considered to be a very playful, thoughtful dog, who is eager to please and is a very quick learner. They love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to their humans whenever possible.

Basepaws analyzes this breed as part of the Pomeranian, Keeshond, and German Spitz Varieties Lineage
The Keeshond (pronounced "kays-hond") is a medium-sized, fluffy dog breed that originated in the Netherlands and is part of the Spitz family of dogs. They were traditionally used as watchdogs on riverboats, farms, and barges. Also known as the "Dutch Barge Dog," they're a symbol of the Dutch Patriots Party, especially associated with the party leader, Cornelis (Kees) de Gyselaer, from which the name "Keeshond" partially originated. After the party's downfall, the breed fell out of favor for a while but saw a resurgence in the early 20th century.
Keeshonds can suffer from hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy, progressive retinal atrophy, and hyperuricosuria. A specific condition for which this breed should also be tested is primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). They can also be prone to obesity, diabetes, skin infections, eye and heart conditions, liver issues, bone pain, deafness, and parasitic worm infections. As for all breeds, genetic screening is recommended to assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Keeshonds are known for their friendly and outgoing nature. They are exceptionally good with children and make excellent family pets. They are intelligent, quick to learn, and eager to please, which makes them relatively easy to train. Keeshonds are also known for being quite vocal, often "talking" to their owners and making their needs and feelings known. They tend to be reserved with strangers but are rarely aggressive. They need a moderate amount of exercise but are equally happy to cuddle on the couch.
The Keeshond is considered a Dutch symbol of patriotism. During the political struggle in the 18th century Netherlands, people showed their allegiance to the Patriots Party by owning a Keeshond. The more, the better the commitment!Keeshonds have a distinctive "spectacles" marking around their eyes, which gives them an alert and intelligent expression.They have a dense double coat which sheds twice a year, a process often called "blowing the coat." During these times, they can lose an impressive amount of fur.The plural of Keeshond is "Keeshonden", which follows Dutch grammar rules.Keeshond is pronounced as “kayz-hawnd”.
