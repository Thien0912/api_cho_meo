Living with a collie and a cat can be a wonderful experience, but it requires some effort and understanding of their unique personalities. Collies are highly intelligent and energetic dogs that thrive on structure and clear communication.
Cats, on the other hand, are naturally more independent and territorial, which can sometimes lead to conflicts with collies. To make it work, you need to establish a harmonious coexistence by setting clear boundaries and rules for both pets.
A key aspect of successful cohabitation is training, and collies respond well to positive reinforcement and consistency. By teaching your collie to respect the cat's space and personal belongings, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
With patience, love, and proper training, it's possible to create a peaceful and loving home for both your collie and cat.
The Collie is a medium-sized herding dog with a muscular build and a medium-length coat.
They typically weigh between 40-65 pounds and stand between 22-26 inches tall at the shoulder.
Collies are highly intelligent and trainable, but can be strong-willed and independent.
Their intelligence and herding instincts make them excellent at problem-solving and adapting to new situations.
Collies are generally good with children, but as with any breed, it's essential to socialize them well.
They are also relatively quiet, barking less than many other breeds.
Collies are prone to eye problems, such as Collie eye anomaly, which can lead to blindness if left untreated.
Regular eye exams and a balanced diet can help prevent or manage this condition.
Collies are known for their loyalty and affection towards their family, making them great companions.
Their high energy levels require regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behavior.
With proper care and attention, Collies can thrive and live long, happy lives.
Collies are known for their intelligence, loyalty, and gentle nature, making them a great breed to introduce to cats.
To start, keep the collie and cat separated initially, allowing them to become familiar with each other's scents without any direct interaction. This can be achieved by exchanging bedding or using pheromone products designed to promote a sense of calm and familiarity.
A gradual and controlled approach is vital when introducing a collie and a cat. Begin by allowing them to see each other from a safe distance, such as through a baby gate or a cracked door. This visual introduction should be accompanied by positive reinforcement, such as treats or praise, to create positive associations.
Collies are herding dogs, and as such, they may have a natural instinct to chase small animals like cats. However, with proper introductions and management, collies and cats can live harmoniously together.
Here are some tips to help you introduce your collie to your cat:
By following these steps and being patient, you can help your collie and cat develop a harmonious relationship.
Creating a harmonious household with collies and cats requires some effort, but it's definitely doable. The key is to create a positive environment where both animals feel safe and comfortable.
To start, it's essential to supervise interactions between the collie and cat at all times. If the collie begins to show signs of chasing behavior, redirect their attention to a toy or treat. The cat should always have a safe space to retreat to if they feel uncomfortable. Providing enrichment and playtime for both the collie and cat can also help create a positive environment.
By following a methodical approach, you can ensure a harmonious household. This involves initial separation, controlled introduction, positive reinforcement, and consistency. Reward both pets for calm and non-aggressive behavior, and maintain consistent rules and boundaries to ensure both pets understand their limits.
Creating a harmonious household with dogs and cats is possible with patience and the right approach.
In fact, with the right steps, you can enjoy the playful antics of a Border Collie and cat, like the shared moments of tranquility and the times when they team up to create mischief.
The first step is to separate the dog and cat by a barrier for at least two weeks, as advised by Demling-Riley.
This allows them to get used to each other's scents without the stress of an immediate face-to-face encounter.
By placing a sock or blanket with the dog's scent in the cat's space and an item with the cat's scent in the dog's space, you can help them become comfortable with each other's presence.
If they're not showing signs of stress, fear, or aggression, you can move on to the next phase and start enjoying the moments of unexpected joy that come with having a harmonious household.

Creating a harmonious household with a Border Collie and a cat requires some planning and patience. The key is to create a positive environment where both pets feel safe and comfortable.
To start, it's essential to supervise interactions between the two pets at all times. If the Border Collie begins to show signs of chasing behavior, redirect their attention to a toy or treat. This will help prevent any potential conflicts.
Providing each pet with their own designated safe space is crucial for managing interactions and preventing unnecessary stress. Cats should have access to elevated perches, hiding spots, or separate rooms where they can retreat and feel secure.
A consistent routine and positive reinforcement can go a long way in creating a harmonious household. Reward both pets for calm and non-aggressive behavior, and maintain consistent rules and boundaries to ensure both pets understand their limits.
Here are some essential steps to follow when introducing a Border Collie to a cat:
By following these steps and creating a positive environment, you can help your Border Collie and cat live together peacefully.
Border Collies are naturally inclined to herd, but many are also gentle and affectionate, making them great companions for cats if socialized early on.
Early socialization plays a crucial role in developing a harmonious relationship between Collies and cats. By introducing them to each other at a young age, you can foster a more understanding and patient dynamic.
Collies have a strong prey drive, which can lead them to view cats as prey, but with proper training, they can learn to recognize the cat as a family member.
Positive reinforcement training techniques, such as rewarding calm behavior around the cat, can be an effective way to reduce aggression and prey drive in Collies.
Border Collies are naturally inclined to herd, but they can also be gentle and affectionate.
Early socialization plays a crucial role in shaping a Border Collie's temperament.
Many Border Collies can be trained to respect boundaries, especially if they're introduced to cats at a young age and develop a more understanding and patient relationship with them.
As pets age, their behavior can change significantly. A once energetic Collie might prefer lounging, while a previously aloof cat might seek more affection.
It's essential to recognize and accommodate these changes to ensure both pets continue to live comfortably together. This means being patient and understanding of their new needs and boundaries.
Collies, in particular, are known for their loyalty and ability to adjust to new situations. With proper training and socialization, they can learn to respect the cat's boundaries and personal space.
As your pets age, it's crucial to maintain a consistent routine and provide them with a comfortable living environment. This can include providing a safe and comfortable space for your Collie to relax, such as a crate.
By doing so, you can help your pets adjust to their new circumstances and maintain a harmonious relationship.
The Herding Instinct is a fundamental aspect of Border Collie behavior. It's what drives them to herd and gather, and it's closely tied to their intelligence.
Their innate herding instinct can sometimes be misinterpreted by cats, who may view it as a threat rather than playful behavior. This highlights the importance of understanding and addressing their tendencies, especially during the early stages of their bond with cats.
Border Collies are naturally inclined to herd and gather, which can sometimes lead to a spirited chase with cats. This dynamic requires careful consideration to ensure a harmonious relationship between the two species.
Their intelligence and herding instinct often work together to create a complex dynamic, making it essential to address their tendencies during the nascent stages of their bond with cats.
Collies have a strong prey drive, which can make them more likely to chase or harm cats. This is due to their herding instinct and smart cognition, which can sometimes lead them to view cats as prey.
Some dog breeds are more prone to chasing cats than others, and collies are one of them. However, with proper training and socialization, collies can learn to live harmoniously with cats.
Collies are highly intelligent dogs that thrive on mental and physical stimulation. They need to be kept busy with activities that challenge their minds and bodies, or they may resort to chasing cats out of boredom.
Training is key to managing a collie's prey drive and teaching them to coexist with cats. By using positive reinforcement techniques, such as rewarding calm behavior, you can help your collie understand that cats are not prey.
Here are some key differences between collies and other breeds when it comes to their prey drive:
Keep in mind that every dog is an individual, and their prey drive can vary depending on their personality and upbringing. With patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement, you can help your collie learn to live peacefully with cats.
Collies are known for their intelligence and loyalty, which makes them a great breed for families with cats. They can learn to interact and adjust to living with a cat sibling, but it's essential to approach the situation with care and patience.
Collies have a natural instinct to herd, which can sometimes lead to chasing behavior towards small animals like cats. However, with proper introductions and management, collies and cats can live harmoniously together.
To manage aggression and nipping, provide the collie with plenty of distractions and teach them the "leave it" command. This can be done by using treats or toys to distract the collie when they start to exhibit aggressive behavior toward the cat.
Supervise the collie and cat when they are together, especially during the initial stages of their interaction. If the collie starts to nip at the cat, it's essential to immediately intervene and separate them.
Here are some tips to help you manage collie and cat interactions:
Early socialization plays a crucial role in developing a positive relationship between a collie and a cat. If introduced to cats at a young age, many collies tend to develop a more understanding and patient relationship with them.

The noble Collie has been a popular dog for some time now as the breed has had its time in the spotlight in popular culture for many years at this point.
If you’re interested to find out why so many people love Collies, our comprehensive breed guide can offer you all the information you need to know about this herding dog-cum-companion. This guide will cover everything you need to know from the temperament to the grooming and feeding needs of the breed.
The Collie originated from the Scottish Highland regions but was also bred in the Scottish Lowlands and Northern England.
They were mainly used as herding dogs and some historians seem to think that the name Collie stems from Colley, which is the name of black-faced sheep that the breed guarded in Scotland. Colley was derived from the word coal owing to the colour of the faces of the sheep.
The original Collies were closer to the size of the modern-day Border Collie and varied in appearance, as they were bred for herding ability and not their appearance originally.
The Collie was brought to the U.S. back in 1879 and the Collie Club of America was created in 1886, which means it is one of the oldest breed clubs around.
The breed then became massively popular in the region in the 1950s after the hit television series Lassie aired. The main character was a Collie called Lassie who regularly came to the rescue of other characters in the show.
The Collie is a large to medium-sized herding dog that comes in two different coat types. The Rough Collie has a full coat with long hair, whereas the Smooth Collie has a smooth coat with short hair. The dog featured in Lassie was a Rough Collie, which is likely the reference for what a Collie looks like for many people.
Both types of the breed come in many different coat colours with blue merle being the most sought-after and tricolour (black with white markings) being quite common.
Well-bred Collies will generally have a kind, gentle and friendly nature. While they were originally bred for their herding and working ability, Collies have become excellent family dogs. Although, they would still be right at home accompanying a shepherd!
Collies do exceptionally well around children and other dogs. They can be excellent pets to have around children due to their soft and playful natures and are often protective of them around strangers.
The Collie is also an excellent watchdog like other herding breeds and will bark to alert their owners of any perceived danger but is not aggressive.
The breed is also an excellent choice for those interested in dog sports as they are extremely intelligent and respond well to training. They specifically excel in herding trials as a result of their breeding.
Collies are; however, not for people who are not active as they are an extremely long-running and active breed that requires daily exercise. It will also be beneficial to have a large space for them to run around during the day.
Collies tend to shed moderately year-round, which means you will be likely to find blue merle-coloured hair everywhere if you find one in this coat! This means that they are not dogs for those with allergies.
The grooming needs of a Collie will depend on the type of coat that your dog has. A Rough Collie generally needs to be thoroughly brushed twice a week owing to their thick furry undercoat. You may initially require the help of a professional grooming service to learn how to groom your Collie properly.
A Smooth Collie has far fewer grooming requirements and generally only needs to be brushed once a week. They should usually be bathed every 6 to 8 weeks as they are normally clean dogs with little odour.
Collie’s nails should be trimmed once a month and their ears should be checked around once a week for any sign of redness, dirt, or odour as this is indicative of an infection.
Collies can be prone to barking excessively as this is how they would warn a shepherd that their flock was in danger!
The breed will generally only bark if something catches their attention or alerts them but can gain a habit of barking excessively if they are left alone for too long or become bored.
Collies will generally not be suitable for those living in apartments as they are large to medium-sized dogs.
They grow to heights around 55 to 66cm and weigh between 22 and 31kg.
Collies are some of the easiest dogs to train out there. They are extremely intelligent, which means that kennel and potty training will be a breeze!
Collies are dogs that can benefit from obedience training as they are high energy and can become unruly.
It is best to start socialising and training your Collie when it’s very young if you get the opportunity as this will make things much easier in the long run.
Collies are intelligent, kind, and playful dogs that love spending time with their owners. They are frequently used as therapy dogs, as they are calm, gentle, and welcoming when trained well and are tall enough to be reached from a hospital bed.
Like most dogs, they may start displaying undesirable behaviour if they are left alone for too long or not stimulated enough. This can come in the form of unnecessary barking and digging.
Collies generally love children and are protective of them. They are also good with other dogs and pets and will sometimes even watch over other pets like rabbits or chickens!
Collies like other breeds are healthy for the most part but are specifically predisposed to certain health conditions such as:
Collies live relatively long lives for dogs and they are known to have a life span between 10 to 14 years.
Collies are larger dogs and therefore normally require 2 or 3 cups of dog food split between 2 meals daily. This will also vary based on the age and activity level of your dog.
If you choose to buy a puppy from a Collie breeder it will cost you around $1700 to $3500. Prospective owners should make sure that the breeder they choose is registered otherwise they may be receiving a dog from a puppy mill.
You will be able to save a lot of money by adopting from a rescue organisation; however, you will likely then end up with a full-grown dog instead of a puppy.
The Collie does not do well when left alone for too long and many resort to barking excessively or misbehaving in other ways by destroying things or digging holes.
If you plan on choosing this breed it would be a good idea to either have other dogs to keep it company or take it to a dog daycare service if you are gone for most of the day.
Collies are extremely loving and affectionate dogs and most will enjoy cuddling with their owners so long as they get rid of their excess energy first!
Border Collies are smaller than Collies and are even more full of energy. Border Collies are generally higher maintenance than Collies and require constant stimulation to discourage them from misbehaving.
Both breeds happen to originate from England and Scotland but can have very different natures with Border Collies being the more highly strung dog.
Collies are great with other pets, which means that most of them will get along well with cats. A Collie puppy introduced to cats early on will however fair better than a full-grown dog meeting one for the first time.

The Collie is a dog breed that originated in the Highlands of Scotland and Northern England. The breed was originally used for herding sheep and cattle, a task for which they are still renowned. It's believed that the name "Collie" derived from the word "colley," which was a type of sheep with black faces that the Collie's ancestors herded. Queen Victoria's love of the Collie is said to have made a great impact on the breed's popularity. During her stays at Scotland's Balmoral Castle, the Collie was in the spotlight and became well-known among her subjects. The Collie's ancestors were believed to have come to Scotland via the Romans when they sought to take over Britain during the 1st century CE. Over time, these dogs were likely bred with other local dogs, eventually giving rise to the modern breed of Collie we know today.
Collies are susceptible to gastric torsion, dermatomyositis, seizures, microphthalmia, Collie eye anomaly, progressive retinal atrophy, demodicosis, and MDR1 drug sensitivity. Other conditions may include cyclic neutropenia, degenerative myelopathy, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), recurrent inflammatory pulmonary disease, dermatomyositis, and hyperuricosuria.
Collies are known for their intelligence, loyalty, and gentle nature. They are extremely family-oriented and get along well with children and other animals. Collies are highly trainable and excel in obedience, agility, and herding trials. Due to their origins as working dogs, they require regular physical and mental stimulation to stay happy and healthy. Their sensitivity makes them attuned to their owner's needs, and they often work well as therapy or assistance dogs. However, it's important to note that like any dog breed, individual temperaments can vary, and not every Collie will exhibit these traits to the same degree. Also, potential owners should be aware that Collies require regular grooming due to their long, dense double coat.
The term "tortoise shell" was originally used to describe the color of the Blue merle Collie.A theory states thta the name Collie comes from a certain kind of black-faced sheep, called colleys, that roamed England.The 1940 novel titled, "Lassie Come Home" by Eric Knight was made into a long-running TV show that launched the breed into the hearts of millions. The impact that the Lassie franchise had on the breed's popularity remains strong throughout the world, even today.

The quintessential working dog, the Collie has been employed on just about every continent on the planet. These dogs have tireless work ethics, and they love nothing more than to please their humans.
There are multiple different types of Collie, but they’re all energetic, loving, and loyal. They may be too much dog for owners who prefer to spend their free time lounging around the house, but if you can keep up with them, they’ll make your life fun and exciting.
If you want to learn more about these wonderful pups, our guide below will fill you in on everything you need to know.
If you’ve never felt your heart start to melt, then we can only assume that you’ve never seen a Collie puppy. These little furballs are constantly in motion, and it’s truly amazing to watch them learn the skills that they’ll utilize later in life. For example, they actually start herding as puppies — and it’s just as adorable as it sounds.
However, they also have a bad habit of nipping people and animals as they try to herd them. You need to break them of this habit as soon as you can because it’s definitely not something you want lingering into adulthood. They’ll get into trouble at every opportunity, so it’s best not to leave them unsupervised. You’ll need to burn off all their energy too unless you’re secretly hoping to buy an entirely new shoe collection.
These dogs are smart enough to start being trained as puppies, and they enjoy the process enough that they’re more likely to pay attention than many similarly-aged dogs. They’ll still give you fits every now and then, though.

The breed is believed to have originated in the Highland Regions of Scotland several hundred years ago. There wasn’t much of a breed standard back then, as their owners were more concerned with their ability to herd than they were their appearance.
In fact, some think that the name “Collie” comes from the Scots word for “coal,” as the original Collies were all-black. Others say that it’s a derivation of the German word “kuli,” which means “worker,” and still others think it comes from a Gaelic word that means “useful.”
Regardless of the etymology behind the name, the breed became famous in the 1860s when the British Queen Victoria discovered the breed and quickly fell in love. Collies soon became in demand among the wealthy elite in England, and they were one of the first breeds to be officially recognized by the Westminster Kennel Club.
They had another influential fan who introduced them to the United States: J.P. Morgan. The American financier popularized the breed stateside, and the American Kennel Club recognized them not long after Westminster did.
Of course, it was Hollywood that made them truly famous – “Lassie” showed the world how useful these dogs could be, and they’ve made countless other appearances on both the big and small screen. That’s no surprise, as their keen intelligence and tireless work ethic make them wonderful co-stars.

While their Border Collie cousins have been awarded the title of “World’s Smartest Dogs,” Standard Collies aren’t far behind. Many experts rank them in the top 20, which is quite impressive in its own right.
They have incredible problem-solving skills, which makes them easy to train; it also makes them fantastic guide or rescue dogs. They can figure out just about anything that you could possibly ask of them.
However, it’s a different kind of intelligence that sets them apart: emotional intelligence. These dogs can anticipate needs, and they have a knack for knowing exactly what you need at any given moment. Regardless of whether you crave a hug or just goofy companionship, your Collie will likely be several steps ahead of you.
They’re incredibly loyal and loving, and they’re prone to being overprotective of their family members (especially kids). This makes them excellent watch dogs, as they’ll bark at strangers but rarely show aggression.
Their natural suspicion of strangers can help protect your family, but it can also make it difficult to have houseguests over. As a result, you should train and socialize your Collie as thoroughly as possible.
Collies make fantastic family pets, as they love nothing more than to spend time with their humans.
They’re especially fond of small children, and they’ll look after them as if they’re their own. This means being unbelievably patient with them, but it can also mean shepherding them away from danger.
You may need to curb their natural herding instincts, at least as far as your kids are concerned. Otherwise, the Collie may nip at or block the child as they try to move.
They sometimes latch onto a single member of the family at the expense of everyone else. This makes it difficult for the other members to bond with the dog or get them to follow commands. As a result, you should make an effort to include the entire family in the training and socialization of your pet.
Their natural suspicion of strangers can make it difficult to have company over, as they may stand and bark at any new faces (especially if they make a move toward your kids). However, if properly trained and socialized, they can be loving and accepting of strangers.
Collies are workaholics; that means they often don’t have the patience for other dogs who simply want to play all the time.
Also, they’ve been bred to protect livestock from threats, which could include strange dogs. This makes them extremely wary of other pooches.
Will this translate to aggression? Not necessarily, but it’s unlikely that your Collie will be best friends with any other animal. There’s a good chance that they’ll just stand and bark at any other dog they see.
As a result, we’d recommend not bringing a Collie into a multi-dog home.
As far as cats and other pets are concerned, Collies are usually tolerant of them. However, they can’t fully suppress their herding instincts, so they may try to force the other pets to live by their rules. This can stress out your other animals, and they may lash out at the dog as a result.
While it’s certainly possible to keep a Collie in an apartment, it’s generally advisable to have a home with a big backyard before you add one of these dogs to your pack.
Space is obviously an issue, as these dogs need plenty of room to run around. You may be able to get away with a couple of trips to the park every day, but it will be difficult for you to give them all the exercise they need.
Since they’re naturally suspicious of strangers, they may not like sharing a building with a bunch of unknown people. They may try to police your neighbors’ comings and goings from your window.
Also, while they’re not an overly vocal breed, they will bark — especially at strangers. You can see how this might become a problem in a crowded apartment building.
That’s not to say it’s impossible to keep one in an apartment, but you’ll have your work cut out for you. Unless you have plenty of free time on your hands (not to mention understanding neighbors), you might be better off picking another breed to adopt.

A post shared by Kenny Loggins (@kennylogginsthecollie)

Collies are wonderful dogs, but they can be high-maintenance. You should know what you’re getting into before you bring one home, so we’ve listed pertinent information below.
Given how energetic these dogs are, they need a kibble that can provide them with all the fuel they need. We recommend one that’s extremely high in protein, as it will give your dog long-lasting energy without fattening them up along the way.
Watch out for ingredients like corn, wheat, soy, and animal by-products; as a general rule, higher-end foods won’t have any of these inside.
Instead, look for premium foods like lean meat, cranberries, spinach, broccoli, and the like. If you know a  food’s healthy for you, it’ll probably be healthy for your dog too.
Just because Collies naturally have big brains doesn’t mean that you don’t need to nourish them. Try to give your dog as many omega fatty acids as possible, especially while they’re puppies. Foods high in these antioxidants include fish, flaxseed, and chia seeds.
The dogs can be prone to hip dysplasia later in life, so you might want to add a glucosamine supplement to their diet while they’re young. It’s no guarantee that they won’t have joint problems later on, but it can help mitigate the damage.
Collies were bred to herd livestock all day long alongside their masters. This means they need a ton of exercise — and they’d prefer to get it with you.
You’re probably not going to be able to work these dogs too much, so don’t worry about overdoing it. Make sure they get at least an hour of strenuous activity per day, but that’s the absolute minimum — more is better.
Their keen intellect and natural agility make them fantastic at agility training, and Collies often dominate competitions. You don’t have to make a career out of it, but setting up an obstacle course in your backyard may not be a bad idea.
They love to take orders and have jobs to do, so daily obedience training is a must. Not only will this make them better-behaved, but it will also make them feel like they’re carrying their weight around the house, which is good for their mental health.
If you don’t give your Collie enough exercise, it will either become depressed or destructive — or both. If you don’t think you can give one of these dogs all the stimulation they need, you’re better off bringing home a different breed.
Training will seem like a full-time job with these animals, but that’s not because they’re disobedient. Quite the opposite, in fact; they just love to learn and make you happy.
You should start training and socializing them from the day you bring them home. They can quickly soak up any commands you give them, so don’t be afraid to challenge them.
They can get bored quickly, so it’s important to keep things fresh. However, unlike many other precocious dogs, they’re often too polite to ignore you when you’ve become tedious.
They live to please you, which can make them quite sensitive. Don’t be harsh or punitive in your training; instead, rely heavily on positive reinforcement. These dogs will run through walls for a bit of praise from their humans.
If not properly socialized, they can become reserved or aggressive around strangers. If your dog is already showing signs of these behaviors, you may want to consult a professional for techniques on correcting it.
Regardless of their coat type, your Collie will need to be brushed at least twice a week to reduce shedding. However, a rough Collie will need even more than that, and you’ll also need to check their coats for burs and other entanglements after they’ve been outside.
They don’t need to be bathed often. You can probably wait until they’re visibly dirty to throw them in the tub.
Their ears need to be cleaned at least once a week, and their teeth should be brushed daily, if possible.
You can trim their nails on an as-needed basis. However, these dogs are so active that they often wear their claws down naturally, so you may not need to trim them at all.
Collies are a fairly healthy breed, especially if they stay in shape. That doesn’t mean they don’t have their fair share of health problems, though.
The breed often suffers from a genetic defect in the MDR1 gene. This makes them extremely sensitive to a variety of drugs, so be aware of that when taking them to the vet. Many breeders screen for this mutation, but it’s not guaranteed.
Puppies also occasionally suffer from a stem cell disorder known as “Grey Collie Syndrome.” Affected puppies are born with a silvery-grey coat; unfortunately, these dogs rarely live past six months of age.
Beyond that, here are a few things to be on the lookout for:
Males are typically larger with a sturdier frame. They also retain more hair during heavy shedding seasons (when they blow their coats), giving them a fuller appearance.
Because the males are generally more powerfully built, females tend to be more agile. They’re lighter on their feet and have finer characteristics. This can make them better-suited for agility competitions.
Males are often easier to train. This is partially because they tend to be more food-motivated, but females also have a strong stubborn streak. Either gender will likely be easier to train than dogs of other breeds, though.
There are two distinct Collie coats: rough and smooth. Rough Collies have a coarse outer coat over a soft, furry undercoat, whereas smooth Collies lack the coarse layer.
It’s not uncommon for there to be both rough and smooth Collies in the same litter. One isn’t better than the other, but smooth Collies don’t shed quite as much.
There’s a bit of semantic confusion that often occurs here. There’s an entire group of dogs known as “Collies;” these include the Border Collie, Shetland Sheepdog, and Bearded Collie.
However, there’s also a breed known as the Collie (or “Standard” Collie). These dogs are usually black and white, whereas the other breeds have a variety of other colors thrown in.
Some dogs enjoy herding; Collies were made for it.
Their entire skeletal structure is designed to herd, in fact. They have a space between their shoulder blades that allows them to lower their up er torso to the ground while keeping their rear at a normal position.
They can hold this pose while moving, allowing them to stay close to the heels of the animals they’re supposed to be safeguarding.
There aren’t many dogs like Collies. Incredibly intelligent and hard-working, these beautiful pups will spend their entire lives trying to please you — and trying to herd everything that comes across their path.
While they’re easy to train, they can be challenging to own, especially for those who don’t like to spend hours every day exercising their dogs. They can also be standoffish toward strangers, but they’re fiercely devoted to (and protective of) their families.
If you think you have the time and energy to devote to one of these dogs, you’ll have a pet that wants nothing more than to make you happy.

This breed of dog was originally found in Northern England, the Scottish Lowlands, and the Highlands of Scotland. They were originally used as herding dogs but are now commonly kept as beloved pets. Collies are known for their high sensitivity and intelligence. They are deeply attached to their owners and have the ability to anticipate their needs. Many stories exist about Collies saving humans or animals due to their remarkable personality traits.
Collies can be identified by two distinct appearances: a short coat, known as the smooth type, and a full coat, known as the rough version. They can adapt to any setting and enjoy both indoor and outdoor activities as long as they receive sufficient exercise. Collies have strong herding instincts, so you may see them chasing or barking at cars, herding children or small animals. However, they are always calm and protective.
These dogs excel in various sports such as agility, lure coursing, herding tests, and obedience. Unless provoked or left alone for a long time, Collies are generally quiet and peaceful. They come in a variety of colors including white, tan, blue merle, and tricolor.
Ahead, we look at Collie dog breed, its history, personality, pros and cons of owning an Collie, characteristics, and must-see facts. We will also examine how to care for this breed and much more. Prepare for a tail-wagging adventure into the world of Collies!
These stunning dogs, known as Collies, were originally discovered in the Highland Regions of Scotland. In the past, their appearance varied greatly as their herding abilities were valued more than their looks. They were typically black and roughly the same size as Border Collies today. However, over time, Collies were selectively bred to develop their distinctive coat and face structure.
The Collie breed made its debut at a dog show in the “Scotch Sheep-dogs” category in Birmingham, England in 1860. In 1879, the first Collie was imported to the United States, and on August 26, 1886, the Collie Club of America, one of the oldest canine specialty clubs, was established. The popularity of Collies skyrocketed after one of them was featured in the 1950s television series, Lassie.

⚡ Fun Fact:
Collies are reputed to be incredibly devoted to and protective of their family, especially young children. They get along well with younger children and smaller pets since they may be lively while also being kind, loving, and gentle. Despite their peaceful demeanor, Collies occasionally show suspicion toward strangers, especially if those individuals approach any small children in the household. They work effectively as guard dogs since they will bark at any strangers but won’t bite. These perceptive animals are renowned for making superb service and therapy dogs. Collies are intelligent dogs who learn quickly and are simple to teach. They are also skilled in canine sports including obedience, agility, and lure coursing. As long as they receive enough activity, these dogs may adjust to the majority of residential settings. All they’ll need to stay content is a daily stroll and some time spent playing outside. They value their families much and like to be around them. They cannot, therefore, spend the entire day alone outside in the backyard. The dog’s training, socialization, and heredity all affect temperament. Expose your Collie to a variety of people and situations while they are young to ensure that they develop into a calm, friendly, and well-rounded dog. Collie breeds have a tendency to bark excessively when bored or frustrated, therefore it’s crucial to keep them cognitively engaged and stimulated. They’ll be peaceful and happy if you let them take part in family activities and sports.
These canines are well-known for their luxurious coats. Because of their longer coats, Rough Collies will require more grooming and upkeep, but Smooth Collies will benefit from frequent brushing as well. Rough Collies should be brushed twice a week, whereas Smooth Collies can be groomed once a week. Baths should be provided as needed, which is around once every six to eight weeks. Once a week, examine their ears for dirt, odor, or redness, and clip their nails once a month. Collies’ teeth should be cleaned at least twice a week to avoid foul odor and to remove germs and accumulation. This breed is not hypoallergenic and sheds little. They are usually not droolers and should not stink. Each week, do a fast at-home checkup to look for any swelling, soreness, redness, or other irregularities. This will assist you in detecting any diseases or injuries before they become an issue.
🍖 Food: We recommend 3.2 cups daily, costing you about $1.50 – $1.90 daily, or approximately $39.00 – $52.00 a month.
