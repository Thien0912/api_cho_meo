Cats come in many beautiful and unique colors and patterns, some more common than others. ‘Torbie’ refers to a tabby tortoiseshell color pattern.
A torbie cat displays patches of the tortoiseshell pattern and the tabby pattern. Not only is torbie one of the rarest color patterns seen in cats, some people say that torbie cats have unique personalities.
Want to learn some facts about torbie cats? Let’s look more closely at some coat color patterns in cats, and what that might mean for their personality, color and temperament.
Torbie cats aren’t hugely common, and the unique nature of their coat pattern adds to their air of mystery. But do they have any other special traits? Let’s look at some interesting facts about torbie cats that you may not have heard before.
The term ‘torbie’ refers to a pattern, not a breed, and this interesting coat type can appear in many breeds and mixed breeds. Any breed that comes in the tabby or tortoiseshell patterns can also come in the torbie pattern. Some cat breeds that can come in torbie include the American Shorthair, British Shorthair, Cornish Rex, and Maine Coons.
Almost all tortoiseshell cats are female, which means almost all torbie cats are also female. For a cat to have the tortoiseshell pattern, they must have two X chromosomes (XX), each carrying the different alleles needed to create the tortoiseshell color pattern. Two XX chromosomes always make a cat female (males have one X and one Y chromosome), so the tortoiseshell pattern is only seen in female cats.
In very rare cases, tortoiseshell or torbie kittens can be born male. This may occur if a cat has Klinefelter’s syndrome, which causes male cats to have three chromosomes (XXY). Male torties and torbies are always sterile due to this genetic disorder.
Tortoiseshell cats are somewhat rare, but torbies are even rarer. The patched tabby pattern is one of the least common of the five tabby patterns. The unique coat pattern of the torbie is technically patched tabby mixed with the tortoiseshell pattern, and the combination of these two uncommon patterns makes the torbie a rare sight.
Like tortoiseshell cats, torbie cats have a reputation for being feisty feline divas. In tortoiseshell, this tendency even has a name: tortitude. Since torbies are part tortoiseshell, it makes sense that some torbies display a similar temperament. Whether tortitude and “torbitude” is a real behavior phenomenon or simply a fancy of the human mind is up for debate, but some research supports the idea of a link between a cat’s temperament and their color – let’s call it the “tortitude theory.”
Torbie cats are special because their fur mixes the stripes of tabby cats with the fiery patches of tortoiseshell cats, creating a unique blend of colors that’s hard to find elsewhere. While tabby and tortoiseshell patterns are beautiful on their own, they become even more striking when they come together in torbie cats.
Cats come in many beautiful colors and patterns: some common and some rare. These different coat patterns all have different names, which can get quite confusing.
To better understand what goes into making the torbie pattern, let’s take a look at some common patterns seen in cats and how they relate to the torbie patterns.
The tortoiseshell coat consists of two colors, black and orange, mottled together in a pattern that resembles the shell of a tortoise or turtle. Tortoiseshell cats can also be “dilute” (lighter versions of black and orange). Dilute tortoiseshell cats have two copies of a dilute allele (an alternative form of a gene) that turns black to blue (gray) and orange to cream. In many parts of the world, tortoiseshell cats are considered to bring good luck and good fortune. Tortie cats have even been called “money cats.”

Calico cats have tri-colored fur in a random pattern of intermixed black, orange, and white. As with tortoiseshell cats, calico can also be “dilute” (lighter versions of black and orange). Dilute calico cats are blue (gray) and cream combined with white.
Cats come in five different tabby patterns, including mackerel tabby, which looks like tiger stripes. Dora Zett / Shutterstock.com
Tabby is the most common pattern seen in domestic cats, and can come in all sorts of colors. When you think of a tabby cat you might think stripes, but the striped tabby pattern (called mackerel tabby) is just one of the five different tabby patterns. Though tabby markings vary, all tabby cats have a distinctive M-shaped mark on their forehead.
Classic tabby: The classic tabby pattern is a marbled swirling pattern on the body, head, legs, and tail. The markings appear random, and you can sometimes see a bull’s-eye or target-shaped pattern on the cat’s side.
Mackerel tabby: Mackerel tabby is a tiger-striped pattern that most people envision when they think of a tabby cat. The distinctive stripes run vertically on the body, encircle the legs, and ring around the tail similar to a raccoon. Most mackerel tabbies also have a solid stripe running down the spine.
Spotted tabby: Spotted tabby cats look a lot like leopards or cheetahs, with spots all over the body rather than stripes. Some cat breeds are well-known for their spots, including the Egyptian Mau and Ocicat.
Ticked tabby: You might be surprised to learn that the ticked coat seen in the Abyssinian, Chausie, and a few other breeds is in fact a type of tabby pattern. You won’t see spots, stripes, or marbling in the ticked tabby. Instead, each individual hair is striped with bands of alternating light and dark color. If you look closely, you’ll see that cats with ticked coats have the distinctive M marking on the forehead that is characteristic of the tabby pattern.
Patched tabby: This pattern consists of two different colors of hair mixed across the coat in a patchwork fashion. Sometimes both colors of patches have tabby markings (for instance, orange tabby and brown tabby). Sometimes, one of the color patches is tabby and the other is another pattern, such as calico (termed “caliby”) or tortoiseshell (called “torbie”).

As previously mentioned, the torbie (tortoiseshell tabby) pattern is a type of patched tabby.
So what’s the difference between a tortoiseshell and a torbie cat? Well, with a torbie cat, the coat has both patches of tortoiseshell-patterned coat and patches of tabby-patterned coat. The tabby part of the coat may be tabby stripes, spots, or marbled. The tortoiseshell portions of the coat may be classic black and orange, or dilute (blue and cream).
--------------------------------------------------
Torbie cats, an endearing combination of tortoiseshell and tabby, are known for their dynamic and engaging personalities. These fascinating felines exhibit a lively and playful demeanor, often becoming the heart of their household entertaining both family and guests with their active nature. Their spirited and engaging behavior makes them excellent companions for those craving a cat with a bit of spunk and sass.
Owners of Torbie cats often describe them as independent yet affectionate. While they may enjoy their alone time basking in the sun or napping in secluded spots, they also crave interaction and can be quite demanding of attention when they decide it’s time for some love. This balance of independence and affection can make them wonderful pets for people who may spend parts of the day away from home but still want a loving companion when they return.
Torbie cats are also known for their intelligence and curiosity. They are often the first to investigate a new object in the home and can be quite adept at solving problems, whether it’s figuring out how to open a cabinet door or deciphering a puzzle toy. This inquisitive nature means they thrive in environments that provide mental stimulation and physical activity, making interactive toys and regular play sessions essential for their well-being.
While Torbie cats can be vocal, their communication is often more about expressing their needs or desires rather than aimless chatter. It’s not uncommon for them to follow their owners around the house, engaging in “conversations” with a series of chirps and meows, especially when they have something important to convey, like a reminder that it's dinner time.
"A unique aspect of Torbie cats is their playful pattern of intertwining both the boldness of Torties and the softness of Tabby coats, reflecting a temperament that’s as varied and engaging as their appearance."
The term "Torbie" is a delightful blend of “tortoiseshell” and “tabby,” hinting at the breed’s distinctive coat pattern which integrates the best of both worlds. Originating from these two descriptive terms, the name reflects the cat's dual heritage and serves to easily identify this specific coat type within the broader category of domestic cats.
The tortoiseshell pattern, characterized by a mix of two colors, usually black and orange, has a storied history that dates back centuries. These patterns have been admired in various cultures, often associated with good luck and prosperity. The addition of tabby stripes to this already illustrious mix adds not only more visual interest but also another layer of historical significance, as tabbies have a rich and ancient lineage believed to trace back to the earliest domesticated cats in the Fertile Crescent.
The Torbie's roots lie primarily in household cats, and their distinct coat patterns likely developed through selective breeding over time, aiming to highlight these unique markings. Their striking appearance combined with the name’s descriptive simplicity makes “Torbie” both a fitting and practical choice, giving a nod to their heritage and their appealing aesthetic.
Torbie cats are cherished for their striking appearance and charming personalities, making them popular among cat enthusiasts globally. Their unique coats and engaging nature make them standout companions, often seen in both urban apartments and rural homes. This popularity sustains a vibrant community of Torbie admirers who frequently share stories, photos, and tips on pet care.
In English-speaking countries, Torbie cats enjoy a significant following. In places like the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, they are often featured in cat shows and are a common subject of social media posts. Their captivating looks and dynamic behavior make them favorites among photographers and cat influencers, further boosting their visibility and popularity.
Outside of English-speaking regions, the allure of Torbie cats continues to grow. In countries like Japan, where unique and beautiful cats are particularly celebrated, the Torbie’s blend of colors and patterns resonates well with the aesthetic preferences. European countries also show a strong appreciation for Torbie cats, often linking their diverse coloration with folklore and cultural narratives about mystical animals or symbols of good fortune.
Overall, the Torbie breed has established itself well across different cultures and continents, with growing communities of pet owners and enthusiasts who celebrate their unique characteristics.
Torbie cats, like their Tortie and tabby counterparts, are generally robust and healthy but do have specific needs that should be met to ensure their well-being. Regular veterinary check-ups are crucial to detect any potential health issues early, such as common feline concerns like dental disease, kidney issues, or obesity.
Diet plays a pivotal role in the health of a Torbie. A balanced diet with high-quality protein sources is essential for maintaining their energy levels and supporting muscle health. Wet food, along with dry food, can help in balancing their hydration needs, especially since cats are often prone to urinary tract issues. Additionally, providing fresh water at all times is vital.
Grooming is another important aspect of caring for a Torbie. Their beautiful coats can require regular brushing to prevent matting and reduce shedding. This not only helps with their appearance but also minimizes hairballs, which can be a common problem for cats. Regular grooming sessions also provide an opportunity to check for any skin issues, parasites, or abnormalities that might need veterinary attention.
Exercise and mental stimulation are key for Torbies, who flourish in environments that allow them to explore and engage. Investing in cat trees, interactive toys, and even harness training for supervised outdoor adventures can help keep them physically and mentally stimulated, reducing the risk of behavioral problems stemming from boredom.
Training a Torbie can be a rewarding experience given their intelligence and eagerness to engage. Positive reinforcement is particularly effective with this breed, as they respond well to treats and affection. Basic training, such as using a litter tray or scratching post, usually comes naturally to them but can be reinforced with consistent rewards and praise.
One of the challenges, however, can be their independent streak. Torbies sometimes prefer to do things their way and may challenge instructions they don’t find appealing. Patience and consistency are key. Providing them with choices and making training sessions short and fun can help maintain their interest and cooperation.
Socialization is another critical aspect of a Torbie’s education. Early exposure to different people, environments, and other pets can help in developing a well-adjusted and confident cat. Playdates with other friendly cats and introducing them to different sounds and sights can reduce fearfulness and anxiety, making them more adaptable to changes in their environment.
For more advanced training, clicker training can be highly beneficial. This method uses a click sound to mark desirable behavior, followed by a reward. Torbie cats can learn a variety of tricks and commands using this technique, which not only enriches their lives but also strengthens the bond between cat and owner.
Selecting the right breed of cat involves understanding the dynamics of your household and the specific needs of the cat. Torbie cats, with their mix of independence and affection, playfulness and curiosity, are an excellent choice for families looking for an engaging and lively companion. Whether in a bustling home or a quiet apartment, they adapt well and bring a unique blend of beauty and personality.
Choosing a Torbie means welcoming not just a pet, but a vibrant personality into your home. At KingPet, we celebrate the diverse and engaging nature of breeds like the Torbie. The joy they bring, combined with their striking appearance, makes them standout participants in our contests. Selecting a Torbie is a rewarding decision that promises a loving and dynamic addition to any family.

You might be familiar with torties, short for tortoiseshell cats, but have you come across torbie cats? While the names “tortie” and “torbie” sound similar, they actually describe two distinct fur patterns, both of which include the tortoiseshell pattern.
Torbie cats are a mix of two different cat fur patterns: tortoiseshell and tabby. Tortoiseshell tabbies are known as “torbies”: a combination of these two words, reflecting the mix of characteristics from each fur pattern. Tortoiseshell patterns are known for their mottled coats, typically featuring a mix of black, brown, red, and orange. On the other hand, tabby cats are distinguished by their striped or spotted fur, often with a characteristic “M” shape on their forehead.
Tortoiseshell cats get their name after the similarity of their coat pattern to a shell of a tortoise.  Tortoiseshell cats are a combination of two colors other than white.  Color combinations can be shades of orange, red, yellow, or cream with shades of dark brown or black fur.
As with calico cats, tortoiseshell cats are almost exclusively female as the genes needed to produce this fur pattern lie on the X chromosome.
Male cats that are tortoiseshell are usually born sterile.  Male tortoiseshell cats are a result of chromosome aberrations and have an extra X chromosome (XXY) that allows for the expression of the fur pattern.
Tabby cats are one of the most common fur patterns found on mixed breed domestic cats.  All tabbies have a dark “M” marking on their forehead, “eyeliner” around the eyes, thin pencil strokes on the face, and banding around the legs and tail.
The Agouti gene is responsible for whether a cat has a tabby pattern or not. The dominant allele (A) causes the cat to be a tabby, while the recessive allele (a) causes the cat to have a solid color.
Torbies combine aspects of both the tortoiseshell and tabby cat fur patterns due to the inherited genes of the cats.  Almost all torbie cats are female because of the tortoiseshell pattern.
Torbies are also sometimes known as “reverse calicos” or “patched tabbies”.  As the name implies, corbies carry both the markings of a tabby cat as well as patches of another color that form the tortoiseshell pattern.
The end effect is a striped or marbled cat with patches of a secondary color which is typically orange (or cream if the cat is a dilute torbie).
Torbies, as with all tortoiseshell cats, are almost entirely female.
Tortie and torbie cats that are male are incredibly rare and are considered “unicorn cats“. Some estimates range from the chance of a torbie being male from 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 10,000.
Dilute torbies is the the lighter or “washed out” version of a torbie.
In cats, the gene responsible for the dilution of coat color is referred to as the “Dilute” gene, symbolized as “D”. This gene has two alleles: D (Dense) and d (Dilute). The Dense allele (D) is dominant and the Dilute allele (d) is recessive.
When a cat inherits the Dilute (d) allele from both parents, the intensity of the coat color is reduced. This results in black color changing to blue (a smoky gray), and red changing to cream.
Like other calico and tortoiseshell cats, torbies have a reputation for being a little short-fused when being handled.  A study published in the Journal of applied animal welfare science surveyed over 1,200 pet owners to see if there was a link between fur color and signs of aggression in cats.  Pet owners self-report that female orange cats (like torbies and orange tabbies) along with grey and white and black and white cats tended to express the most aggression during handling at vet offices or while being held than any other cat fur color.
One study, published in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science in 2014, looked at the average length of stay at a no-kill animal shelter for 5,659 between 2008 and 2012.  The average length of stay at the shelter for all cats was a little over two months at 61.2 days.
The study found that torbies had the shortest average length of stay at 48.3 days. This was a lower average length of stay than the straightforward calicos, tortoiseshells, and tabbies which each averaged a similar length of stay well over 60 days.
A torbie cat with d/d genes will have the combination of tortoiseshell and tabby coat patterns but those colors will be creams and blues instead of more vibrant fur coat colors.
With their combination tabby and tortoiseshell fur patterns, torbies are less common compared to their straightforward tabby and tortoiseshell counterparts. Since the dilute gene is recessive, a dilute torbie cat is even more rare than the vibrantly colored torbie cats.
Brown, W. P., & Morgan, K. T. (2015). Age, breed designation, coat color, and coat pattern influenced the length of stay of cats at a no-kill shelter. Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 18(2), 169-180. DOI: 10.1080/10888705.2014.971156

Cats come in a plethora of coat colors and patterns. Whether you want a white, orange, black, or grey cat, you will get it.
There are even grey or blue-colored cats that look ridiculously cute.
Apart from color, a cat can also have a pattern such as a tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and more.
Cat owners imagine that the color of their cat has nothing to do with anything else but it really does.
For one, it has a direct effect on the beauty of your feline friend.
Secondly, coat color affects a number of other things such as personality, availability, grooming needs, and more.
Before you buy or adopt a new kitty, therefore, it’s always a good idea to know what to expect from your feline friend.
This is why today I will walk you through one of the most cute coat colors among felines:  Torbie.
From physical characteristics,  differences from other tri-color coat patterns, impacts on health, to fascinating facts, here is all you need to know about this beautiful coat pattern.
TORBIE CATS OVERVIEW
NAME: Torbie
NICKNAMES: Reverse torties, reverse calicos, striped tortie, patched tabbies, Tabby with patches
COAT PATTERN: Mixture of Tortoiseshell & Tabby Stripes
COAT TYPE: Long Or Short
PERSONALITY: A bit aggressive, energetic, and sassy
BREEDS THAT MANIFEST THE PATTERN: Persians, British Shorthair, American shorthair, Japanese Bobtail, Main coon, Cornish Rex
HYPOALLERGENIC: No
AVAILABILITY: Rare
Before we talk about a Torbie cat (plus similar cat names/terms like Tortoiseshell aka Tortie, Tabby, and Calico), I would love to bring to your attention that these names describe coat patterns, which result from certain genetic combinations in cats.
They are NOT actual cat breeds. So, there is no cat breed referred to as a Torbie, a Tortie, Calico, or Tabby.
Even if you are tempted to check Cat Fancier’s Association list of breeds, you won’t find them listed there!
Several breeds including Persians, British Shorthair, American shorthair, Japanese Bobtail, Main coon, Cornish Rex, and some mixed breeds can exhibit these coat patterns.
Let’s continue…
A Torbie is basically a cat that exhibits a mixture of two coat patterns:  Tortoiseshell and Tabby coat patterns.
To be on the same page, it is important that we understand first the difference between a tortoiseshell and a tabby cat as well as closely related coat patterns like calico.
Tortoiseshell cats are felines with tri-colored coats that resembles the shell of a tortoise.
(Yes, the name comes about because the coat color has the appearance of a tortoises shell).
The most common coat color combination in tortoiseshell cats is red and black.
You may also find other color combinations like orange, gold, or cream.
These can be either small patches of each color or brindle pattern, consisting of each color mottled throughout the body (Pictures # 1, 2 & 3)
Finally, there are muted tortoiseshell patterns, which feature gray and cream color combinations, giving them less vibrant coats (Picture # 4).
Generally, you will find very few white patches/color expressions in a tortoiseshell cat.
In other words, tortoiseshell cats either lack white or only have small white patches on their coats (Picture # 3).
Tabbies are cats with distinctive stripes, lines, dots, flecks, or swirling coat patterns on their bodies, sides, shoulders, chest, neck, flanks, or tummy.
Most tabby cats feature four distinct patterns:
Calicos have at least three coat colors, which at their most basic include white, black, and orange.
But like Torties, you may also find other color variations like reddish, cream, blue-black, gold, or brown.
To this end, I know you are probably asking about the difference between Calico and Tortoiseshell cats…
Well, the two coat patterns are a bit confusing but here are the main differences:
NB: Calico patch patterns are almost as unique as snowflakes and that’s why you will seldom see two exactly similar Calicos.
Now that we understand what tortoiseshell, tabby, and calico cats are, let’s shift our focus to Torbies…
Put simply, Torbies are mixtures of two coat patterns: Tortoiseshell and Tabby. So, they are basically Torties that also feature tabby stripes.
(As you have probably guessed, the term is simply a concatenation of the Tortie and Tabby words)
They are also referred to as patched tabbies because they are basically tabbies with patches of a secondary color—red or cream.
So, the biggest difference between a Tortie and a Torbie is the presence or lack of tabby stripes—the former lacks tabby markings or stripes while the latter features the stripes.
Given the combination of Tortoiseshell and Tabby coat patterns, Torbies are less common compared to plain tortoiseshell, tabby, and calicos.
If you still can’t identify a Torbie patter, use the following steps:
That’s it! Hopefully, you now know what a Torbie cat is.
Let’s now discuss other aspects of a Torbie cat…
Most Tortiseshell cats (and by extension Torbies) are females. This is because the chromosome responsible for the coat color also determines the gender of the cat.
Here’s is a quick explanation…
The coat color of cats is determined by a combination of genes that control the production of pigments in their fur.
These genes are located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes.
(I hope you can recall (from your biology class) that the two sex chromosomes are the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. In mammals, including humans and cats, females have two X chromosomes (XX), while their male counterparts have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY)).
The genes that control coat color in cats are located on the X chromosome.
Since females have two X chromosomes, they can have two different versions of the coat color genes: the dominant black/brown coloration and the recessive red or orange coloration.
Male cats, on the other hand, can only inherit one version of the gene, so they can only be black/brown or red/orange, NOT both.
When a female cat inherits one X chromosome with the black/brown gene and one X chromosome with the red/orange gene, the two colors are expressed in different patches on her fur, creating the tortoiseshell pattern.
Therefore, a tortoiseshell pattern can only occur in cats with two X chromosomes (i.e. females).
To be male, a Tortie/Torbie will have to have three chromosomes XXY i.e a genetic mutation must occur that causes the expression of two X chromosomes besides the Y chromosome. (see the picture below)
This phenomenon is often called Klinefelter Syndrome and is often associated with certain health/developmental issues.
For instance, Torties/Torbies with the condition are infertile.
Now Klinefelter Syndrome is relatively rare, occurring in about 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 male births.
Hopefully, you can now see why male tortoiseshell cats are extremely rare, while female tortoiseshell cats are relatively common.
If you are still confused, consider watching the video below:
Like Torties and Torbies, Calicos are almost always female due to the same analogy.
See, the orange coat color in cats is controlled by a gene, O, which is located on the X chromosome.
Male cats have only one X chromosome, and if they inherit the O gene, they will be either OY (orange) or oY (non-orange color).
However, female cats possess two X chromosomes and can be OO (which denotes dominant orange), oo (which denotes recessive orange, resulting in a coat of another color), or Oo (which denotes tricolor with both dominant and recessive orange genes), thus increasing the likelihood of producing a calico pattern.
BUT
Tabby cats, unlike tortoiseshell, Torbie, and Calico cats, do not display a predominantly female gender bias.
In fact, the majority of ginger tabby cats are male.
The gene responsible for the ginger coat color is located on the X chromosome, and females require two copies of this gene to express it, while males need only one.
Therefore, the likelihood of a male ginger tabby cat is three times higher than that of a female.
Having a cat with a clean bill of health makes all the difference during pet parenting.
Well, even if you end up with a kitten with a few complications, it is in your best interest to be aware of the issues beforehand.
Well, the good news is that a cat with any of the above- mentioned tri-color coat patterns (a tabby, calico, torbie, or tortoiseshell coat pattern)  is not directly prone to any health complications, thanks to the fact that these are just coat patterns NOT breeds.
To know what your torbie cat is prone to, check the breed.
If he is a Main Coon, for instance, expect him to have certain predispositions such as polycystic kidneys, hip dysplasia, and spinal muscular atrophy.
A Persian torbie cat may also be prone to a polycystic kidney ailment, bladder stones, PRA, cardiomyopathy, and dynamic retinal decay.
In short, always seek to find out the issues that your individual cat suffers from.
Since torbie is not necessarily the name of the breed but the coat color, personality characteristics is not specific to one special breed.
As aforementioned, you can find a Torbie in many of the available cat breeds including the American Shorthair, Persian, Maine Coon, Cornish Rex, British Shorthair, and more—which translates to one fact: varying personalities.
Having said that, cats of this specific color patterns tend to have a distinct personality or temperament.
UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital did a study on the link between coat color and behavior.
The conclusion was that cats that exhibit tortie coat pattern have a sassy temperament. This has since been referred to as ‘tortitude’.
Funny enough, most tortie owners agree that their fur babies are indeed a bit aggressive, energetic, and sassy.
They tend to have opinions on everything and will let you know what it is.
Lucky for you, they are also some of the most affectionate cats in the world.
They love human company despite being a tad independent like most cats.
Plus, their striking beauty will always blow your mind.

Unfortunately, you cannot tell whether your torbie is hypoallergenic or not simply by looking at the color of his coat.
Cat allergies are triggered by your body’s immune response to a specific protein.
The bad news is that all cats possess this protein no matter the color of the skin.
The good news is that all tortoiseshell cats including torbies tend to produce the protein in smaller amounts and thus can be less of a problem here.
However, they still have the protein and may cause the response in susceptible persons.
How long your striped torbie lives is dependent upon the breed rather than the color of his coat.
On average, the most common cat breeds have a lifespan of 14 years. This number can go up or down depending on the actual breed.
Like the former point above, you need to find out which breed you are dealing with to know the actual lifespan.
Torbies can have long or short hair.
Whether you are looking for a kitten with a rich luscious coat or one with a short and easy-to-maintain coat, you will find the right fit for you.
However, thanks to the rare nature of the coat color, you will need to do some serious research to find a cat that ticks all your boxes.
Many countries around the world view torbies and other torties as special cats.
Japan claims that they protect homes from ghosts.
The Englishmen believe that the coat of a torbie can heal a wart.
Reversed torties are also believed to be ‘money cats’ in the United States.
