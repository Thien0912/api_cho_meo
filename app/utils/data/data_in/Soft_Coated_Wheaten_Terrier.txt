The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier originally comes from Ireland. They are friendly and playful and even considered a reasonable pet for first-time Terrier owners, although experience with training is generally recommended.
They can adapt to life in an apartment, but their coat requires plenty of grooming. Wheaten Terriers are energetic pups whose owners must provide enough mental and physical stimulation to keep them happy and healthy.
Height:
17–20 inches
Weight:
30-45 pounds
Lifespan:
12–15 years
Colors:
Beige, gold, brown
Suitable for:
Active owners with time to dedicate to grooming
Temperament:
Affectionate, intelligent, lively, playful, energetic
The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier is a skilled working dog bred to hunt vermin. This all-purpose pup was also used by farmers to aid with herding, guard livestock, and more. Today, they are more likely to be kept as companion pets, but they retain many of the characteristics that made them such efficient working dogs.
While you might not want to put your Wheaten to work, you must offer outlets for your dog’s energy and mental acuity. Long walks will be well received, but they also benefit from more intense forms of exercise, such as agility courses and other canine sports.
Participating in these sports provides exercise, can assist with socialization, and will help build a bond between you and your new dog.

The Wheaten is not a particularly popular or common breed in the U.S. and is rare in other countries. However, you can find breeders who specialize in raising Wheatens. Ensure that the parents have been screened for dysplasia since they are susceptible to elbow dysplasia.
Meet the puppy and mother, and pay particular attention to how the puppy reacts when first meeting you. They should be confident enough to want to approach you but not so confident that they run right up to you. Puppies should still look to their mothers for social guidance, so you can get a good idea of how a Wheaten puppy will interact with you by how the mother interacts.
The scarcity of the breed means you might end up paying a little more for a Wheaten, especially one with good parents. The highest prices are typically reserved for those with award-winning lineage. They can be challenging to train, and they have high energy and grooming requirements, which means that some first-time owners may think they require too much work to train and socialize. Therefore, several Wheaten Terriers can end up in shelters, allowing you to adopt rather than buy.
When adopting, you have fewer options in selecting the ideal age and sex, but it’s much cheaper than buying a Wheaten from a breeder.
While hounds like Beagles and Irish Wolfhounds could only be kept by nobility in ancient Ireland, Terriers were kept by peasants. There aren’t many records of the Wheaten Terrier, but they have been bred and kept in Ireland for centuries.
Landowners bred Wheatens to perform various tasks on farms, including hunting vermin, herding, and protecting livestock. Despite a seemingly long history, the Irish Kennel Club did not recognize them until 1937. Less than 10 years later, in 1946, the first Wheatens made their way to the U.S., and the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1973.

The Wheaten is a good working dog that can take on many tasks, but being a guard dog is not one of them. Although they might bark if strangers approach, it’s more likely to be a bark of excitement and encouragement than one of warning. This friendly pup usually gets along with everybody, whether they are family, friends, or delivery people. The desire to please also makes the Wheaten a good choice of companion dog, although it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be easy to train.
The Terrier in the Wheaten is energetic, and although they enjoy walks, they prefer to be off the leash running around with other dogs. Terriers are lively and they are always looking for something to do. They need mental stimulation and become bored and destructive if they’re neglected.
Although moderately sized for a Terrier, the Wheaten can adapt well to apartment living as long as they get enough exercise and are given plenty of time to smell and socialize outdoors.
The friendly Wheaten makes an excellent pet and is ideal for individuals, couples, and families with children. Although care should always be taken with young children and any dogs, the Wheaten is a hardy little pup that loves to play and is very affectionate.
You will need to teach ground rules, especially regarding whose toys are whose, or your Wheaten will likely try to steal your child’s toys. They aren’t aggressive dogs and aren’t typically overprotective of family, so your child can safely have friends around to play, even if the games get a little rough, and there shouldn’t be any reactive behavior.
As well as getting on with children, adults, and strangers, the Wheaten can do very well with other dogs. They enjoy socializing outside the house and can also form close bonds with other family dogs, especially if willing to join the Wheaten’s fun and games.
The Wheaten can also live with cats, but introductions should be made when both animals are as young as possible and taken gradually. However, the dog’s history as vermin control means they have a high prey drive, and they cannot be trusted around smaller animals like rats, gerbils, or birds. This is true in the house, but is also true while out walking, and you will need exceptional recall if you intend to let the Wheaten off the leash while out.

The Wheaten Terrier is a working breed but is now more commonly seen as a companion rather than a farm dog. They enjoy spending time with their humans, will get along with most people and dogs, and can live in multi-pet households.
However, they are high-maintenance pets. They need a reasonable amount of exercise, require mental stimulation, and their coats require ongoing maintenance to prevent them from getting matted and becoming uncomfortable. Below, we’ll look at some of the factors you need to consider before taking adopting a Wheaten.
It’s best for your Wheaten to eat high-quality dog food, and they need approximately 2 cups per day, split into two or three meals. If you feed treats, they should not account for any more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories, and you should reduce the amount you feed accordingly.
With canned food, follow the guidelines on the packaging and weigh your dog to ensure you feed an appropriate amount of food. It is also possible to feed a combination of dry and wet food. Dry food is nutritionally complete and has a longer shelf life than wet food. However, some dogs find wet food more palatable.
The energetic Wheaten Terrier needs moderately high levels of exercise and is an athletic breed. Walk your dog for at least 60 minutes a day, ideally up to 90 minutes, and look for other, more engaging ways to exercise them.
The Wheaten can do very well in agility-based events, herding, and other canine sports. Sports provide a great release of energy, which can prevent your Terrier from getting bored, reduce unwanted behaviors, and offer a fun activity for both of you to enjoy. Playing fetch or other games in the yard will also wear out your pup and challenge their mind. When you’re indoors, you can give your Wheaten an interactive game to provide mental stimulation.
Training is somewhat unpredictable with the Wheaten Terrier. They’re an intelligent breed that generally likes to please their owner. However, Terriers can get bored of training if you don’t make it fun and exciting. Start training from a young age and use games to keep your dog engaged.
Start attending puppy classes when your dog is young. You can use the opportunity to socialize with other dogs and people while learning the basics of dog training. Recall will be an important part of training a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier because this lively dog will want to chase small animals. You should also concentrate on basic commands like sit and stay. These can help get you out of a lot of tricky situations.
One of the most challenging aspects of owning a Wheaten is keeping that coat in check. They only have a single layer of fur that sheds often. Brushing helps control shedding by removing dead hairs in a controlled manner. Daily grooming will not only eliminate dead hairs but also enable you to give your Wheaten a soft, well-groomed look.
You will need to trim the facial hair to keep it under control, and the beard will need a lot of cleaning. Food and other debris will gather in the facial hair, and this can make it a very challenging aspect of Wheaten ownership.
You will also need to trim nails, typically every 2 months, and brush your dog’s teeth three times a week to reduce the likelihood of dental disease.
The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier is a generally hardy dog, but they are prone to some illnesses and conditions. One of the more common ailments is elbow dysplasia. Elbow dysplasia typically occurs when the bones that meet at the elbow joint are not aligned or grow awkwardly. It can cause lameness and, eventually, lead to arthritis.
Catching it early may allow your vet to operate and correct the problem, but you should ensure that the parent dogs were screened for dysplasia. Dogs with dysplasia should not be used for breeding.
Minor Conditions

 Addison’s Disease
 Allergies
 Cataracts
 Elbow Dysplasia

Serious Conditions

 Kidney Problems
 Protein Wasting Disease


Male vs Female
The male Wheaten will grow a little bigger and heavier than the female. While individual character, as well as socialization and training, are more likely to determine a dog’s character, some owners claim males are more likely to be territorial, more prone to wanderlust, and more playful.
Females are less likely to try and escape but can be moodier.

3 Little-Known Facts About the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier
1. They Were Once Known as the Poor Man’s Irish Wolfhound
In Ancient Ireland, only landowners could own Hounds, including the popular Irish Wolfhound. As such, other classes owned Terriers like the Wheaten Terrier, and their popularity with the lower classes earned them the nickname of the poor man’s Irish Wolfhound.

2. They Used to Have Docked Tails
At this time, owners would also dock the tails of their Wheaten Terriers because this showed tax collectors that they were not liable to pay the dog tax that some breeds attracted.

3. They’re Born with Dark Coats
Although they are known for their pale beige coats as adults, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are born with dark coats. By the time they reach approximately 2 years of age, the coat has lightened to the color of wheat.


Final Thoughts
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is a fairly uncommon breed in the U.S. and was accepted by the AKC in 1973. The breed was raised as a working dog in Ireland, where they were used to perform multiple tasks on farms, including vermin hunting, herding, and protecting livestock.
They are friendly and playful, as well as loving and loyal to their owners. However, they have high exercise and grooming requirements, which means they certainly aren’t a low-maintenance choice. After they’re thoroughly trained, the Wheaten is considered one of the easier Terriers to keep as a family pet.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, sometimes spelled âSoftcoated Wheaten Terrier,â is a compact and squarely proportioned dog. The moderately long head is rectangular in appearance and in proportion with the body. The strong muzzle is relatively short compared to the skull and has a defined stop. The black nose is large for the size of the dog. The teeth meet in a scissors bite and the lips are black. The wide-set eyes are almond shaped and come in a reddish brown to a medium brown color. Light or yellow eye color can occur but is a breed fault in the written standard. The V-shaped ears fold forward and are level with the skull. The medium-length neck gradually widens into the body. The back is straight, forming a level topline. The front legs are straight and the paws are compact and round with black toenails. The high-set tail is either docked or kept natural. Note: docking tails is illegal in most parts of Europe. Dewclaws are usually removed. The single, wavy coat comes in shades of wheaten.Â Puppies are born dark brown and lighten to the final adult wheaten color by age two. There are two coat varieties, the American and the Irish. The Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is strong, agile and well-coordinated. It is a happy, playful, spirited and friendly terrier. Alert, it makes a great watchdog and barks at the arrival of guests. It is usually very loving with children and gets along reasonably well with other dogs. An  unsocialized dog with a meek owner who does not know how and when to correct negative behaviors may end up with a dog-aggressive dog. Some of these dogs that were not raised with cats may not get along well with them. All it takes is some fast movement on the part of the cat, and the dog's instincts will take over and he will chase them. The dog needs to be corrected right before it takes off after the cat. These dogs have a puppy attitude that remains with them throughout their lives. They are sweet-tempered, docile and self-confident. This breed needs to be taught, preferably when young, but older dogs can learn what is and is not acceptable behavior. It is very intelligent, so it will generally grasp quickly what is required of it. It has a straightforward nature and needs to be handled in a straightforward manner. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers bond closely with their family. They seldom bark unnecessarily. The Soft Coated Wheaten should be well socialized with other dogs while it is a young puppy, but adults can learn what is unacceptable behavior if they have an owner who properly communicates with them. In order to have a well-behaved Wheaten, you must be firm, but calm, consistent and confident with the dog. Meek owners will find the dog will easily take over the home and will be hard to control. Do not allow this dog to jump on humans. Jumping dogs are not "greeting" the human. Jumping is a respect and a dominancy issue.
Height: Males 18 - 20 inches (46 - 51 cm) Females 17 - 19 inches (43 - 48 cm)
Weight: Males 35 - 45 pounds (16 - 20 kg) Females 30 - 40 pounds (14 - 18 kg)
Prone to protein wasting disease (PLE and PLN) and flea allergies.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is good for apartment life. These dogs are moderately active indoors and a small yard will do. This breed does not tolerate heat very well.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier can get by with moderate exercise as long as it is taken for daily walks.
About 12-15 years
About 5-6 puppies
When grooming the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, the object is to achieve a natural look, and brushing can make the soft coat fuzzy. So using a brush is not recommended. Instead, frequent, even daily, combing of the long, profuse coat with a medium-toothed comb is recommended to keep it free of tangles—beginning when the dog is a puppy. Clean the eyes and check the ears carefully. Bathe or dry shampoo when necessary. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier does not shed in the spring and fall, but loose hair should be combed out of the coat from time to time. A well-groomed dog will shed very little. This breed is good for allergy suffers.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier originated in Ireland and is possibly one of the oldest Irish breeds. It is related to both the Kerry Blue and the Irish Terrier. It was known as the "poor man's dog," working on farms as herders, protecting the border and as a hunter of vermin and small game. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier was first imported to the United States in 1946. In 1973 it was recognized by the AKC. Some of the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier's talents are hunting, watchdog, herding and ratter.

Originally called the “Poor Man’s Wolfhound” and hailing from Ireland, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers were versatile dogs. These dogs guarded the farm against both human and animal intruders, killed vermin and were herders and hunters. In the 1940s, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier was imported to the United States but it took until 1973 for the American Kennel Club to recognize this breed officially.

Today, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers compete in obedience, agility, and tracking competitions, and are used in animal-assisted therapy.

Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are believed to be a cross between the Kerry Blue Terrier and one of the larger mixed terrier breeds popular in the Irish farming communities. As well, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is believed to be one of Ireland’s oldest breeds of dog.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier was recognized by the AKC in 1973.


As with most breeds, you’ll want to feed your Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier a diet of high-quality dry dog food or homemade meals. As well, you may choose to add a coat supplement, like a little corn or safflower oil, sprinkled over the food once a day, which will help keep the coat from drying out. For an added treat, a daily milkbone adds nutrition and keeps teeth clean.

A fierce competitor at obedience trials and events as well as agility and hunting competitions, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier’s have a high level of ability to solve problems and are less independent than many of the terrier breeds.


An intelligent breed, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier will quickly learn what owners want.

Training for the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier should be started at an early age using positive training methods, which will strengthen the bond between the trainer and the dog. Never train your dog using punishment methods as this can seriously limit the dog’s trust of you. Because this breed likes to play, you should plan to a playtime before and after each short training session to encourage engagement in training activities. Repetitive training is not required and will cause the dog to be less compliant.

You’ll get the best results from your Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier by challenging it both mentally and physically during training. Some games, commands and tasks can include fetch, completing obstacle courses and even to playing hide and seek with favorite toys or even family members. Since it has a chase instinct, this breed should be taught to work on a retractable lead. As well, socialization should be a key component of any Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier training program from the earliest possible age.


Male Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers weigh 35 to 45 pounds, while females weigh 30 to 40 pounds.

Like all terriers, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has a bit of a stubborn or independent streak, but this is usually quickly corrected with proper training and socialization. You dog will need a challenge during training sessions otherwise it will become bored and non-responsive.

If you socialize your Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier from an early age, it will get along with other dogs. This breed gets along with other dogs, but it is not good with cats, unless it has been carefully socialized and raised with cats since it was a puppy.

The male Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier may be more dog-aggressive than females so neutering and socialization is particularly important. This dog isn’t a problem barker like many terriers, but it will usually bark just to let you know when someone new has arrived at your doorstep. At first, your Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier may be somewhat stand-offish with new people, but it will warm up to guests after a few visits.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier won’t lose its puppy playfulness as it grows older. It will love playing with kids and isn’t prone to snapping or biting like many of the terrier breeds are. You’ll find that this breed is protective of children and will listen to commands by children, making it an ideal playmate for kids.

A close bond will be formed with your family and your Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier bonds. This dog does best when it’s constantly with the family. It can tolerate some time alone, but this breed does best when it’s an active part of the family on a daily basis.


The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has few health problems to lookout for. Protein wasting diseases (PLN and PLE) are a concern with this breed. These are immune diseases that aren’t noticeable until the dog is over five years old. Renal Dysplasia, a kidney problem, and flea allergies, both which can be treated are issues as well. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is also known to occasionally suffer from hip dysplasia, von Willebrands Disease and Progressive Retinal Atrophy.


Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers have a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years.


Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are active, versatile family dogs that can live a variety of situations, including the country, suburb or city, as long as it gets the exercise it needs. Energetic, playful, and exuberant, this breed requires moderate exercise to keep from becoming bored. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is a moderately active dog indoors but it still needs a daily walk and play time in a secure fenced yard. When outside of the fenced yard, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers should be on a leash as it loves chasing after squirrels and other small animals. Your dog will always be ready for a hike, jogging, or playing ball, and it does well in dog sports such as herding, tracking, fly ball and agility.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier won’t lose its puppy playfulness as it grows older.


The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: “As its name implies, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is prized for its coat, which is soft, silky, with a gentle wave, and of warm wheaten color. Underneath, however, is a formidable dog that leaves no doubt as to his terrier origins. Square and medium-sized, he is happy, steady, self-confident and alert to his surroundings.”


The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has a single, silky relatively long and wavy coat that covers its entire body and all its fur is the same length. The coat should be wavy, not curly or straight, and should not be frizzy looking in appearance. Its face will have a beard, and if you plan on showing your dog, its coat can’t be clipped or plucked. This breed doesn’t shed much as long as you take care of its coat, and is recommended for those people that have dog allergies.


The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier will be a welcome addition to any home. Start the socialization process as early as possible and introduce it to as many people, dogs and animals as possible.

There has been a recent surge in dog lovers and prospective dog parents interested in hypoallergenic pups. The allure of a hypoallergenic dog is undeniable for those who may feel limited due to allergies. But does the perfect allergy-free pet truly exist?While there is no such thing as a completely hypoallergenic dog, certain breeds are less likely to trigger allergic reactions. This could open the door for pet allergy sufferers to add a furry companion to the family. This guide will explore the reality of hypoallergenic dogs and help you choose the dog that best suits the needs and sensitivities of your family.What is a “Hypoallergenic Dog?”Let’s start with the basics: what exactly is a hypoallergenic dog? Contrary to popular belief, the term hypoallergenic, when applied to a product or item, does not mean that it absolutely cannot cause an allergic reaction. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “hypoallergenic” is defined as “having little likelihood of causing an allergic response.”These are dog breeds that are less likely to cause problems for allergy sufferers due to various physical characteristics. For example, the breed may be low shedding, have shorter coats (or be considered hairless), or the coat type naturally catches and traps allergens like loose hair and dander, controlling its spread around your home.While these qualities make it more likely that these dogs could co-exist peacefully with an allergic family member, it is important to note that they are not 100% free from allergens.Which Dogs are Considered to be HypoallergenicDeciding which dogs are considered to be hypoallergenic is a bit of a grey area. Some breeds will make the list when speaking with one expert, and not the list shared by the next. This can make it difficult to determine if a dog you are considering will be a good fit for your home.Even if the dog breed you are considering is well-known for their hypoallergenic coats, I recommend having a conversation with the breeder, the shelter/rescue you are adopting from, and your doctor (or allergist) to prepare yourself to take precautions and minimize any risk. Individual dogs may have unique grooming needs or considerations even within a breed.Here is a list of breeds commonly referred to as hypoallergenic: Affenpinscher Afghan Hound American Hairless TerrierBarbado da Terceira Barbet Bedlington Terrier Bichon Frise Bolognese Chinese Crested Coton de Tulear Irish Water Spaniel Kerry Blue Terrier Lagotto Romagnolo Lowchen Maltese Peruvian Inca Orchid Poodle (Toy, Miniature, Standard) Portuguese Water DogRussian Tsvetnaya BolonkaSchnauzer ( Miniature, Standard, Giant) Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Xoloitzcuintli Yorkshire TerrierWhat about mixed-breed dogs? With the current buzz surrounding poodle mixes like Golden Doodles, Bernedoodles, Labradoodles, and more, many interested in finding a hypoallergenic companion have been told they are the perfect option. The truth is that no one can give you an honest and definite answer that can be applied to all dogs of a specific mix.While “doodle” dogs do have poodles in their genes, it can’t be guaranteed that the hypoallergenic qualities of a poodle coat will be present in every puppy. For example, a Golden Doodle (Golden Retriever/Poodle) could be born with a hypoallergenic poodle-like coat or a coat that resembles the Golden Retriever more. If you live with allergies, you know that Golden Retrievers are definitely not a hypoallergenic option.This isn’t to say that mixed breeds won’t be hypoallergenic. However, you need to consider each dog&#39;s physical attributes individually instead of making an assumption based on their breed makeup. Dog Breeds Commonly Mislabeled as HypoallergenicOf course, while people generally mean well when making recommendations of the best dog for people with allergies, mistakes are going to be made. Some dog breeds are often recommended that shouldn’t be given this label.As we just discussed, the first group of dogs that should be mentioned here are mixed-breed dogs. While mixed breeds can be born with the hypoallergenic characteristics of a parent, there is no guarantee that the puppies will inherit those physical traits. Many families have adopted poodle mixes with the promise of purchasing a hypoallergenic dog, only to find their new beloved family member is badly triggering allergies in the home.Dog breeds often mistaken for hypoallergenic may share traits or commonalities with dogs on the previous list. However, they have other characteristics that contribute to allergic reactions in those around them. For example, a dog could have a very short coat but produce larger amounts of dander, a common dog-related allergen.Purebreds that are often mistaken or mislabeled as hypoallergenic include: Basset Hound Boxer Doberman Pinscher  Labrador Retriever  Pug Shih TzuIf in doubt, speak with the breeder or rescue worker about your needs. A reputable breeder will be knowledgeable about the breed they produce and committed to only placing their dogs in homes that are an ideal fit. Shelter and rescue workers are dedicated to finding the best home for the dogs in their care. Even if the dog you’re considering adopting isn’t a good fit, they will likely have recommendations for others you should consider.
There’s no doubt that dogs are by far the most popular pets in the U.S., with roughly 65.1 million homes having one or more dogs as pets. But not all breeds are loved equally, according to the latest studies from the American Pet Products Association. Certain dog breeds seem a bit more loved by Americans than others and these rankings are a great insight into their popularity in different cities.&nbsp;The North American Pet Health Insurance Association also reports that the number of insured pets in the U.S. has increased around 22.6% annually since 2020, which indicates that doggos are continuing to steal the spotlight as the most famous pets around. In fact, the vast majority of insured pets in the country are dogs.&nbsp; U.S. News & World Report analyzed all this data to reveal the five most popular dog breeds in 25 major U.S. cities, indicating some very unique dog ownership trends.&nbsp;1.

Soft Coated Golden Basics
The Soft Coated Golden is a fun and loving mix of the always happy Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and the friendly, sweet-natured Golden Retriever. Without question an ideal family dog, this playful pooch gets along with kids of all ages and other animals so is a perfect fit for a multi-pet family. The terrier side of this dog can be a bit stubborn and is known to be overly-exuberant when displaying affection &ndash; often jumping up on strangers and trying to lick faces &ndash; however this bubbly nature can be toned down a little with early training. The challenge with this people-loving dog is not that he wants to be involved in all family activities, but he doesn&rsquo;t do well when left on his own for longer periods of time. Both parent breeds are known to suffer from separation anxiety that can result in destructive behaviors and this means that an ideal home for this pooch is one where a pet parent is at home.
The friendly, playful Soft Coated Golden brings the sweet-natured Golden Retriever together with the fun-loving Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier.
Origin
The Soft Coated Golden is a Designer Dog which means he dates back no further than the 1980s or 1990s, when breeders first began crossing two or more popular pure-breds to produce a dog that was healthier, often non-shedding and sometimes smaller and gentler than many of the foundation breeds. With the Soft Coated Golden, his pure-bred parents include the Golden Retriever and the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and in spite of he himself being a fairly &ldquo;young&rdquo; breed, his parents have some pretty serious roots. The Wheaten dates back over 200 years to Ireland where he was bred to be a jack-of-all-trades farm dog. From herding to hunting to guarding livestock, this feisty little dog did it all. Across the pond in Scotland, the Golden Retriever was being developed by hunters who were looking for a dog that was capable of hunting on both land and water and could bring back waterfowl with a gentle &ldquo;mouth&rdquo; meaning without damaging the bird. He also dates back almost 200 years, to the mid-18th century.

Spring is a season of renewal, so it’s the perfect time to do some cleaning around the house to freshen things up, get rid of things you no longer need, and make space for new things. But if you share your home with pets, it’s important to take a few steps to ensure their well-being while you do your spring cleaning. Check out the information below to see how spring cleaning could potentially have adverse effects on pets, and what you can do to keep everyone happy.
We often associate larger brains with greater intelligence, but a recent study challenges this assumption in our canine companions. The study, published November 13 th  in the journal Biology Letters, aimed to explore whether there was any tangible connection between the physical size of a dog’s brain and their mental capabilities. The results suggest we may want to reconsider this common stereotype, at least where dogs are concerned. The idea isn’t entirely out of left field. Previous studies have found that in many mammals, a direct correlation has been found between bigger brains and higher survival odds due to their capacity to effectively process information and make better decisions. Considering this, the findings of the new study surprised many. “The key difference here is that dogs are not in a natural environment,” explained Ana Balcarcel, lead author of the new study. “They are a function of artificial selection… a very directed selection, evolution under human hands.” Researchers compared 14 behavioral traits from the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire and the relative brain-to-skull size of 1682 dog skulls covering 172 breeds housed at the Natural History Museum Bern in Switzerland. They found several patterns, but these patterns went against our previous understanding. Dog breeds known to be most trainable and intelligent, like working dogs bred to perform complex skills, were found to have the smallest relative brain size. This included dog breeds most likely to excel in human-assistance roles, like guide dogs, police dogs, and those involved with search-and-rescue. Meanwhile, toy dog breeds bred mainly to serve as companions, like Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Yorkshire Terriers, were found to have larger relative brain sizes. Statistically, these breeds are also more likely to exhibit higher levels of fear, aggression, and separation anxiety. The most interesting thing about this for many researchers is that we, as a society, didn’t just choose breeds that were best suited for these working roles (which happened to have smaller brain ratios). Instead, over generations, they have been bred to be trainable, independent, and better at problem-solving. “We can say that we have really altered the brains – not just the body sizes and the proportions of different dogs, but it looks like we have also changed their brains in a significant way,” stated Balcarcel. Interestingly enough, the difference in brain size may also reflect our impact on the dogs through domestication. The study revealed that the brain of the average domesticated dog is approximately 20% smaller than that of a wild gray wolf relative to body size. However, domesticated dogs must understand and operate with higher social skills than wild dogs. Consider the unique skills your dog demonstrates daily, regardless of their breed. Domesticated dogs are expected to learn how to interpret our gaze, body language, and many verbal commands just to live as a family dog. Moving forward, the research team plans to dig further into the comparison between various dog breeds physically and their function by analyzing other physical differences, like the shape of specific parts of the brain.

For most, the holiday season is a time of joy and happiness. But, that joy can quickly turn to stress and anxiety if your beloved pet experiences a medical emergency – especially with most veterinary clinics operating on reduced hours or even closing entirely during the holidays.While you should always prioritize preventative care, like keeping up with your annual checkups and ensuring your pet’s medications are fully stocked, unexpected situations can arise.In this guide, we will talk about what to do in an emergency when your veterinarian is closed. We’ll discuss what is (and isn’t) considered an emergency and ways to find veterinary care, including in-person and telemedicine/online care.Make sure you’re prepared for anything this holiday season!Emergency or Not an Emergency?One of the most important things to keep in mind heading into the holidays is that not every situation constitutes an emergency. While it may feel like it at the time, if you take a deep breath and look at the situation through calm, rational eyes, you may find that your “emergency” is something you can handle confidently on your own.Minor IssuesThe following health-related issues are relatively common during the holiday season, but you can address them at home with the right information and first-aid supplies. If you are faced with any of these situations, scroll down to find solutions to take care of your pet without the need for a trip to an emergency veterinarian.Minor health issues often seen during the holidays include:Mild vomiting or diarrhea: Occasional struggles with upset stomachs, vomiting, or diarrhea are everyday struggles, especially if your pet has eaten a little too many leftovers (even if the foods are puppy-safe). Mild digestive problems can be managed at home with proper hydration and a bland diet.Minor cuts or scrapes: A well-stocked first aid kit will have everything you need to clean and bandage minor injuries like these at home. But keep an eye on it for signs of infection.Mild Lethargy: Is your dog's activity a little sluggish or tired? While these signs may make you concerned, they are often just the result of a busy or stressful day, which is common during the rush of the holidays.If you’re in doubt, use the resources I’m sharing below to call a professional and run the situation by them. They can either direct you to seek medical care or ease your mind that you are doing everything necessary to take care of your beloved pet.True EmergenciesWhile there are situations you can handle at home, there are also emergencies that require immediate veterinary attention. In these situations, time is of the essence.Here are a few situations where you should seek medical help ASAP. Don’t hesitate:Difficulty breathing: If you see rapid, shallow breathing or notice any visible difficulty breathing, that is a real emergency. Get your pet to a veterinarian as quickly as possible.Seizures or tremors: Seeing your pet experience these conditions can be frightening, especially if it’s the first time! If you notice any signs of seizures or tremors, this could be a red flag that there is a bigger medical issue at play. The sooner you get your pet to a vet, the sooner they can identify the underlying cause.Loss of consciousness or difficulty waking up: While mild lethargy is likely the result of a little added stress and activity, if your pet is unresponsive or cannot be roused, this is likely something more serious.Severe bleeding: A minor cut can be treated at home. However, if you try and fail to stop the bleeding despite direct pressure and first aid measures, this is considered a medical emergency.Difficulty urination or defecating: Has your pet started straining, crying out while going to the bathroom, or producing only small amounts of urine or stool? If so, something serious could be going on that requires medical intervention!Sudden pain or swelling: Pay attention if you notice signs of pain. Pain and swelling don’t just happen – there is an underlying cause. While it could be minor, there is also the chance that the cause of your pet’s pain and discomfort is a serious and immediate concern. The only way to find out is to bring your pet to a vet for testing.Ingestion of toxic substances: Some of the biggest concerns surrounding the holiday season are the many things they can eat that they shouldn’t – alcohol, chocolate, macadamia nuts, tinsel, poinsettias, and more. If your pet has ingested something toxic or poisonous, don’t wait. Contact a veterinarian or the pet poison control hotline immediately.By supervising your pet throughout the holiday season, being aware of the signs of an emergency, and knowing what is or isn’t considered an immediate risk, you can prioritize the health and well-being of your pup this holiday season. This will let you know if your pet can be treated safely at home or if you need to seek out options for veterinary care when your regular veterinarian is unavailable.
Aromatherapy, the therapeutic use of essential oils derived from plants, is a growing trend - not just for humans but also for pets, especially dogs. Thanks to their exceptional sense of smell, dogs are particularly responsive to scents, making them good candidates for this practice. When used correctly, aromatherapy can offer several benefits for a dog’s emotional and physical well-being. However, it’s crucial to approach it with caution and the right knowledge.Understanding Aromatherapy and Its Benefits for DogsAromatherapy works by releasing scent molecules from essential oils. Once inhaled, these molecules travel to the brain, where they can help promote relaxation and support overall psychological well-being. Here are some potential benefits for your furry friend:1. Stress and Anxiety ReliefDogs are highly sensitive creatures and can become  anxious due to loud noises, travel, separation, or changes in routine. Essential oils like  lavender and chamomile are known for their calming properties and can help soothe a nervous or hyperactive dog.
Keeping senior dogs active is essential for their overall health and well-being. Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, supports joint function, and provides mental stimulation, all of which can improve their quality of life. However, as dogs age, their energy levels, mobility, and joint health change, requiring adjustments to their exercise routine. Choosing low-impact activities tailored to their needs can keep them comfortable while reducing the risk of injury. Here’s how to keep an older dog moving safely and effectively.Walking: A Gentle Yet Effective WorkoutWalking is one of the best exercises for senior dogs, providing cardiovascular benefits, joint support, and mental enrichment. To ensure safety and comfort:Keep walks shorter and slower than in their younger years, adjusting based on their endurance.Opt for soft surfaces like grass or dirt trails instead of hard pavement to reduce joint strain.Watch for signs of fatigue, such as slowing down, heavy panting, or limping, and allow rest breaks as needed.Always  carry fresh water to keep your dog hydrated, especially in warm weather.
The holiday season is a time for festive decorations, but for dog owners, it’s also a time for extra vigilance. Curious pups are often tempted to nibble on anything new and shiny, including mistletoe. While this iconic holiday plant is beautiful, it can be dangerous if ingested. Knowing what to do if your dog eats mistletoe is crucial for their safety and well-being.Why Is Mistletoe Dangerous?Mistletoe is a parasitic plant that contains toxic substances such as phoratoxins and lectins. Both European mistletoe (Viscum album) and American mistletoe (Phoradendron species) can be harmful to dogs, though the American variety is slightly less toxic. Every part of the plant — leaves, berries, and stems — is potentially dangerous. Ingesting mistletoe can lead to symptoms of poisoning, which may range from mild to severe depending on the amount consumed and your dog’s size, age, and breed.Symptoms of Mistletoe Poisoning in DogsIf your dog eats mistletoe, watch for the following symptoms:DroolingAbdominal pain (whimpering or restlessness)VomitingDiarrheaLethargyDifficulty breathingSlowed heart rateSeizures (in rare cases)The severity of these symptoms depends on how much mistletoe was ingested.What to Do If Your Dog Eats MistletoeStay Calm Panicking can make it harder to assess the situation and take appropriate action. Your dog may also pick up on your stress, which can worsen their agitation.Assess the Situation Try to determine how much mistletoe your dog consumed. Check for any remaining pieces of the plant to help estimate the amount ingested.Remove Any Remaining Mistletoe Safely dispose of any leftover mistletoe to prevent further accidents. Ensure it’s out of your dog’s reach.Contact a Veterinarian Call your vet or an animal poison control hotline, such as the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at 1-888-426-4435. Be prepared to provide details such as:The type of mistletoe (European or American)The approximate amount ingestedYour dog’s weight and current symptomsFollow Veterinary Advice Your vet may recommend bringing your dog in for treatment or monitoring them at home. Follow their instructions carefully.Preventing Mistletoe IngestionThe best way to protect your dog is to keep mistletoe out of reach. Here are some tips:Use Artificial Mistletoe:  Fake mistletoe looks just as festive but is much safer.

But while it's not necessarily an issue to worry about, it can be unsightly (particularly with light-colored dogs or cats) and deserves to be addressed on a regular basis—in other words, cleaned up.If the discharge is smelly or excessive, you’ll want your vet to weigh in on whether your pet may have an eye infection or be suffering from allergies that require a little more care than a simple wipe-down.Assuming that’s not the case and its just a matter of working eye maintenance into your pet’s hygiene regimen, there’s a wide range of products that are superb at tackling the crust and also removing any staining. What I love most, is that there is something suited to every pet’s personal preference. Because let’s face it when it comes to cleaning up your little guy’s face, it’s never one size fits all, is it?

During times of tragedy, sometimes we find the most heartwarming stories of hope and resilience. An example of this is the story of Carrot Cake, a beloved family cat whose story will bring a smile to your face and a tear to your eye. By this point, you have likely heard about the devastating  Eaton Fire. The fire destroyed over 9,000 buildings and resulted in 17 lives lost, making it one of the most destructive fires in California’s history. Alongside this heartbreaking loss of homes and belongings, many pet parents faced the agonizing uncertainty of whether their furry family members had survived. Imagine the fear and uncertainty of having to evacuate your home, not knowing if you’d ever see your pet again. This was the sad reality for many. While the ideal situation involves evacuating with your best friend, situations can sometimes prevent that from becoming a reality – like a pet who has hidden and cannot be found. That’s exactly what happened to Stephen and his family when the Eaton Fire quickly approached their Altadena home. They had to leave, and sadly, despite their best efforts to locate him, Carrot Cake was nowhere to be found. When they were finally able to return, their home was gone. “[We] came back the following morning, [and] my house was cinders. I mean, my whole house was gone. I lost everything,” Stephen shared in a video interview. Nine days after the fire started, first responders made an incredible discovery. In a burnt-out area of Altadena, they discovered Carrot Cake. He had suffered burns to his paws and singed fur, but he was alive. The miracle cat was taken to the  Pasadena Humane Society, where the heartwarming magic began. Stephen never gave up hope. “I knew he was a fighter. I thought maybe he had survived. It’s not that surprising to me. If any cat was going to survive, it was going to be this one,” he said. And he was right. Thanks to Carrot Cake being microchipped, shelter workers were able to contact Stephen and share the great news. The brave fighter was going to be reunited with his family. The reunion, captured on video, was incredibly emotional. Stephen was understandably overcome with joy and relief, exclaiming, “I just can’t believe it. I can’t believe they found him. I never thought I’d see him again,” tearfully petting Carrot Cake after seeing him safe and sound in a carrier.
Trimming your dog’s nails is a routine task that many dog parents handle with confidence. However, when your pup has a coat of jet-black fur, this simple task can become considerably more challenging. Unlike dogs with lighter-colored nails, where the quick (the sensitive part of the nail containing blood vessels and nerves) is easily visible, black nails can make it difficult to see where to safely trim. This can lead to anxiety for both you and your best friend. But fear not! With a little patience and the right techniques, you can safely and effectively trim your black dog’s nails, ensuring their comfort and well-being. Get started with this key grooming technique today! Why is Cutting Your Dog’s Nails So Important? Before we focus on the specifics of cutting black dog nails, let’s start with the basics. Why is keeping your dog’s nails trimmed and cared for so important? We often discuss the importance of grooming for dogs, including brushing your dog’s coat, haircuts for some breeds, dental care to prevent plaque build-up, and more. But caring for their nails is another aspect of your dog’s routine maintenance for their overall health and comfort. Overgrown nails can cause pain when walking or running. As your dog places their paw down on the ground, if the nail makes contact, this can push back on the paw causing discomfort or forcing your dog to alter their gait or posture to compensate. Over time, this can lead to more severe problems like long-term joint issues. Long nails can also reduce traction, causing your dog to slip and fall. This can have significant implications for senior dogs or those recovering from surgery or an injury that affects their mobility. In addition to your dog’s health, nail care is essential for a harmonious home. Longer, untrimmed nails can damage your floors, furniture, and other belongings. Keeping your dog’s nails trimmed back makes it possible for everyone to live together happily without getting hit with unnecessary damage and repair costs. How Do You Know Where the Quick is On Black Dog Nails? Knowing the location of the quick when trimming your dog’s nails is essential, regardless of their coat color. But why? What is the quick, and what are the risks if you don’t pay attention to it? As mentioned above, the quick is the sensitive area within the nail that contains blood vessels and nerves. This area is concealed within the nail and protected from harm or damage. However, when trimming the nails, you risk cutting the nail back too far and cutting into the quick. This can cause pain, bleeding, and unnecessary distress for your dog. It’s relatively easy to spot the quick on dogs with lighter-colored nails, as it can be seen through the nail as a pink or reddish spot. However, black nails present a unique challenge. The dark pigmentation of the nail makes it difficult or impossible to see the quick inside. Luckily, there are several techniques you can use to safely navigate this. One of the easiest and most effective options is to use a light source like a flashlight or phone light to shine a light through the nail. The quick will be identifiable as it will appear as a darker shadow within the nail. Other options include:Feeling for the groove or indent in the underside of the nail, as the quick will start just above this areaTrimming small amounts at a time while monitoring the appearance changes at the end of the nailUsing alternatives to nail trimming, like nail grinders and filing boardsIs it Better to Cut or Grind Black Dog Nails? The decision between cutting or grinding your dog’s nails is one that many pet parents debate. The truth is that there is no one correct answer. Both options have advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice for you will depend on several factors. However, it often comes down to personal preferences and your dog’s comfort level. Cutting a black dog’s nails with clippers is the quickest method. This is an easy solution for dogs who are already used to having their paws handled. However, if they are afraid of nail trims, even the site of the clippers can trigger anxiety. Knowing where to cut will require a keen eye and focus. You need to identify the location of the quick and take as much excess nail off as possible while avoiding harming this delicate area. This can be challenging if your dog keeps trying to pull their paw away, even more so if they have black nails concealing the quick. A slight miscalculation could cause pain and bleeding, putting your pup at risk of infection. Grinding your dog’s nails with a Dremel-like tool is a safe alternative for many pet owners. This uses an electrical file to slowly grind down small amounts of the nail. While this makes it possible to control the amount of the nail being removed better, protecting the quick, the noise and vibration of a grinder can be scary for some dogs. Ultimately, the best method for maintaining your black dog’s nails is the one that you and your dog are most comfortable with.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, sometimes spelled âSoftcoated Wheaten Terrier,â is a compact and squarely proportioned dog. The moderately long head is rectangular in appearance and in proportion with the body. The strong muzzle is relatively short compared to the skull and has a defined stop. The black nose is large for the size of the dog. The teeth meet in a scissors bite and the lips are black. The wide-set eyes are almond shaped and come in a reddish brown to a medium brown color. Light or yellow eye color can occur but is a breed fault in the written standard. The V-shaped ears fold forward and are level with the skull. The medium-length neck gradually widens into the body. The back is straight, forming a level topline. The front legs are straight and the paws are compact and round with black toenails. The high-set tail is either docked or kept natural. Note: docking tails is illegal in most parts of Europe. Dewclaws are usually removed. The single, wavy coat comes in shades of wheaten.Â Puppies are born dark brown and lighten to the final adult wheaten color by age two. There are two coat varieties, the American and the Irish. The Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is strong, agile and well-coordinated. It is a happy, playful, spirited and friendly terrier. Alert, it makes a great watchdog and barks at the arrival of guests. It is usually very loving with children and gets along reasonably well with other dogs. An  unsocialized dog with a meek owner who does not know how and when to correct negative behaviors may end up with a dog-aggressive dog. Some of these dogs that were not raised with cats may not get along well with them. All it takes is some fast movement on the part of the cat, and the dog's instincts will take over and he will chase them. The dog needs to be corrected right before it takes off after the cat. These dogs have a puppy attitude that remains with them throughout their lives. They are sweet-tempered, docile and self-confident. This breed needs to be taught, preferably when young, but older dogs can learn what is and is not acceptable behavior. It is very intelligent, so it will generally grasp quickly what is required of it. It has a straightforward nature and needs to be handled in a straightforward manner. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers bond closely with their family. They seldom bark unnecessarily. The Soft Coated Wheaten should be well socialized with other dogs while it is a young puppy, but adults can learn what is unacceptable behavior if they have an owner who properly communicates with them. In order to have a well-behaved Wheaten, you must be firm, but calm, consistent and confident with the dog. Meek owners will find the dog will easily take over the home and will be hard to control. Do not allow this dog to jump on humans. Jumping dogs are not "greeting" the human. Jumping is a respect and a dominancy issue.
Height: Males 18 - 20 inches (46 - 51 cm) Females 17 - 19 inches (43 - 48 cm)
Weight: Males 35 - 45 pounds (16 - 20 kg) Females 30 - 40 pounds (14 - 18 kg)
Prone to protein wasting disease (PLE and PLN) and flea allergies.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is good for apartment life. These dogs are moderately active indoors and a small yard will do. This breed does not tolerate heat very well.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier can get by with moderate exercise as long as it is taken for daily walks.

When grooming the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, the object is to achieve a natural look, and brushing can make the soft coat fuzzy. So using a brush is not recommended. Instead, frequent, even daily, combing of the long, profuse coat with a medium-toothed comb is recommended to keep it free of tangles—beginning when the dog is a puppy. Clean the eyes and check the ears carefully. Bathe or dry shampoo when necessary. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier does not shed in the spring and fall, but loose hair should be combed out of the coat from time to time. A well-groomed dog will shed very little. This breed is good for allergy suffers.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier originated in Ireland and is possibly one of the oldest Irish breeds. It is related to both the Kerry Blue and the Irish Terrier. It was known as the "poor man's dog," working on farms as herders, protecting the border and as a hunter of vermin and small game. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier was first imported to the United States in 1946. In 1973 it was recognized by the AKC. Some of the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier's talents are hunting, watchdog, herding and ratter.
