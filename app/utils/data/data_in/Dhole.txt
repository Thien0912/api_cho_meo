Although the Dhole was once found across half the world, it is now an endangered species and there are believed to be just 2,500 adults left in the world.

Although they were once found across Asia, Europe, and North America, Dholes were effectively driven out of many of these regions around 15,000 years ago. Today, they are only found in Asia and primarily in India and China. They are known to have considerable land requirements, which means that they demand a lot of space on which to prowl and hunt.
Unfortunately, because of these requirements and because of hunting and poaching by humans, and a loss of habitat and prey, there are thought to be less than 2,500 breeding adults left in the world today. That means there are fewer Dholes than there are tigers, but there is surprisingly little research and information on the breed, let alone conservation work to help save the depleted population of this wild dog.
Dholes are approximately the size of a German Shepherd. They weigh around 40 pounds and can measure up to 3 feet long. In terms of physical appearance, they have similar features and coloring to the Red Fox with amber eyes, auburn fur, and a black tail. They are closely related to African Wild Dogs.
The Dhole is a pack animal and can live in packs of between just two and ten members. They are fast runners and hunt in packs, regularly taking down deer. It has also been reported that packs of Dholes have been seen taking on tigers, and it is possible that they have managed to kill animals as large as this. The adult Dhole is a very fast eater, and it can also regurgitate food to supply other members of the pack with nourishment.
Although they are in the same family as dogs, Dholes don’t communicate by barking or howling, they chatter and whimper in a similar manner to foxes. They also whistle, hence the nickname of whistling dogs.
It is believed that there was once a large population of Dholes across three continents: Asia, Europe, and North America. But something caused the range of this animal to be limited to just parts of Asia, about 15,000 years ago. As a result, the species is primarily found in China and India, today, and their existence in some of the most populated regions on earth is believed to be one of the reasons that numbers are in decline.
There isn’t as much research on Dholes as on other animals of the same region, like tigers. And because the Dhole needs such a large range to live on, it is especially susceptible to habitat loss as well as a loss of their prey. Today, there are roughly 2,200 breeding adults left and the species is in danger of being lost.
Dholes have an unusual method of communication, at least compared to other dog species. Their clicking, whistling, and chattering is closest to the noises made by foxes, rather than the howls of wolves or the barking of dogs.
This predator uses speed as one of its primary weapons when taking down prey. Adult Dholes can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour.
As well as being fast runners, the species is also a very fast eater, with an adult capable of eating a kilogram of meat in about 4 seconds. It can also regurgitate the food later, to feed and nourish other pack members.
Dholes hunt in small groups, and by hunting in a group they are capable of taking down animals larger than themselves. They usually hunt hooved animals like deer, but they have been known to attack tigers and bears, with whom they compete for territory and prey in some areas.
One of the reasons that Dholes are struggling for numbers is because of a loss of habitat. They have one of the largest land area requirements of any land animal and can have a territory as large as 34 square miles. Considering they are found in some of the most densely populated parts of the world, this need for so much space can be a problem.
The dhole is a breed of wild dog and even if it could be kept as a pet, most countries have strict laws about doing so. The breed is not considered a good pet and shouldn’t be kept as a pet, although we should do more to learn about the Dhole to help ensure that the species does not go extinct.

The Dhole is a breed of wild dog that is found in parts of Asia. There is only a very small population of this predator left today, as its habitat and prey are in decline and the species has a very high land area demand. The Dhole is a wild dog and not kept as a pet, but this whistling, fast-running, fast-eating, member of the Canidae family is an intriguing story in itself.

dholes versus a tiger
Dholes (Cuon alpinus) are a kind of wild dog immortalized by Rudyard Kipling in "The Jungle Book". Also known a the red dogs of Asia, they are about the size of a coyote and look like a cross between or a fox and a dog or a coyote and a dingo. Kipling's characterized dholes as savage killers with "no manners” — a view shared by many Indians. Until recently they were treated as vermin and regarded as a threat to livestock and were killed by local people whenever the opportunity presented itself. [Source: Natural History, November 1999]
Dholes range from the Altai Mountains in Mongolia in the north and throughout China and extend southwards through the forest tracts of India, Myanmar (Burma), into the Malayan Archipelago. Three subspecies of dhole exist in India alone (Trans-Himalayan, Himalayan, and Peninsular). Dholes once ranged from Siberia to Sumatra. About 15,000 dholes remain in all of India, about a third of them live in southern India.
Dholes can even thrive in cities. Even so their numbers are diminishing. They are endangered animals. Their numbers are unknown but have dropped dramatically in recent years, primarily as a result of loss of habitat, diseases and poaching of their prey. Even though the Indian Wildlife Act of 1972 made dholes a protected species in India they have been reduced to remnant populations even in areas where they are protected.

Dholes are about the size of a medium to large dog: with a head and body length of 90 centimeters (35 inches) and a 40-to-45-centimeter (16-18-inch)  tail. They weigh  17 to 21 kilograms (37.44 to 46.26 pounds). They stand 50 centimeters (20 inches) at the shoulder. Sexual Dimorphism (differences between males and females) is present: Males are larger than females. Males weigh up to 21 kilograms (46 pounds); females up to 17 kilograms (37 pounds).  [Source: Raquel Chacon, Animal Diversity Web (ADW) /=]
Dholes are usually a rusty red in color, with a pale underbelly and a black tail. Depending on the region, fur may vary from light brownish gray to a uniform red coat. A dhole is born with a sooty brown color, acquiring an adult color at three months of age.
What sets them apart from other canids is their unusually thick muzzle and one less molar tooth on each side of its lower jaw. Other members of the family Canidae have a total of 42 teeth.  Dholes also have dark, almost always black, bushy tails.  Their average lifespan in captivity is 16.0 years.
Dholes  are terricolous (live on the ground), motile (move around as opposed to being stationary), social (associates with others of its species; forms social groups), and have dominance hierarchies (ranking systems or pecking orders among members of a long-term social group, where dominance status affects access to resources or mates). They sense using touch and chemicals usually detected with smell. /=[Source: Raquel Chacon, Animal Diversity Web (ADW) /=]
Dholes are very social animals. They live in packs with seven to 25 members and are led, as is the case of wolves, by an Alpha male and Alpha female.  They communicate with each other using unique whistling sounds.  Like wolves, jackals and African wild dogs they defecate in communal latrines in fixed places.
Dholes interact with other dholes outside of their own group. According to Animal Diversity Web: They are similar to the African Wild Dog in that they engage in cooperative group hunting and group care of young. Dholes are very fond of water. After meals they race to a water site, and sometimes, if the water is near their kill, dholes will leave their food for a small drink of water. They have also been spotted sitting in shallow pools of water regardless of the temperature. Just as domestic dogs, dholes wag their tails. There is rarely any evidence of aggressiveness among pack members (except for the cubs, who like to play fight) and there is almost never any bullying. /=\
Dholes are omnivores (eat a variety of things, including plants and animals). Animal foods include mammals, reptiles, insects. Among the plant foods they eat are wild berries and fruit. Packs of dholes prey on mammals ranging from rodents to deer. Among their favorite prey are wild pigs, hares, wild goats and sheep. Occasionally they take monkeys. [Source: Raquel Chacon, Animal Diversity Web (ADW) /=]
Dholes hunt in packs using tactic like those of African wild dogs and feed on animals much larger than themselves including antelope. Dholes chase down their prey, kill it and devour it one sitting and then move on to find more prey. A pack typically hunts over an area of 30 square miles. Hunting strategies vary with terrain and plant cover. The packs usually travel over the range and regularly visit places frequented by their prey. A high-pitched whistle is used to coordinate cooperative hunting.
dhole and sambar
In India, its main prey is chitral, or spotted deer.  In Thailand they often feed on sambar deer. When pursuing these animals they attack from different directions and try to separate their prey — ideally young fawns — from the rest of the herd. Their attacks are often thwarted by the mothers of fawns.
Unlike many other "dogs," the dhole seldom kills by biting the throat. Larger mammals are attacked from the rear, while smaller ones are caught by any part of the bodies. The smaller mammals are killed by a swift blow to the head; the larger mammals are immediately disembowled. Dholes compete for the food, not by fighting, but by how fast they can eat. An adult dhole can eat up to four kilograms  (8.8lbs) of meat in one hour. Two to three dholes can kill a 50 kilograms  (110 pounds) deer in less than two minutes, and they begin to feed on it before it is dead. The larger prey rarely die from the attack itself, but from blood loss and shock as their intestines, heart, liver, and eyes are feasted upon. /=\
Dholes are monogamous (have one mate at a time). They are also cooperative breeders (helpers provide assistance in raising young that are not their own). The number of offspring ranges from two to six, with the average litter having three or four pups. [Source: Raquel Chacon, Animal Diversity Web (ADW) /=]
Each pack contains a dominant monogamous pair. Subordinate pack members help care for the young of the dominant pair. Dholes pair off during the mating season, a single week in September or October. Although there are several adult females the alpha female is the only one that does any mating. The Alpha male shows the most interests in her but other males may mount her.
The gestation period for dholes ranges from 60 to 63 days. The average weaning age is 58 days.
On average males females reach sexual or reproductive maturity at one year of age. Pups are born throughout the end of fall, winter, and the first spring months (November — March). Female dhole can have up to 16 mammae, suggesting their ability to take care of large litters.
December is the denning month for dholes in southern India. Dens are constructed near streambeds or among rocks. Females dig their dens deep into the earth along the banks of dry streambeds. After a female dhole has given birth, a few other adults take part in feeding the mother as well as the pups. Beginning at around three weeks, the ups are fed regurgitated meat by their mother. /=\
While mothers remain in the den with the pups other members of the pack hunt, often bringing back meat for the mother. When the pups are one month old they are moved from the den to a cave. Then the mother begins hunting while older siblings watch over the pups. The pups are then fed regurgitated meat from all the pack members. Pups are preyed upon by jackals and leopards. When pups are six months old they join the pack on hunts. They usually don't make their first kill until they are around 1½ years old.
On the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List dholes are listed as Endangered. In CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild) they are in Appendix II, which lists species not necessarily threatened with extinction now but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled. [Source: Raquel Chacon, Animal Diversity Web (ADW) /=]
On rare occasions, dholes can attack livestock. But on the side of the equation dholes can be an indirect food source for the residents of the jungles. Dholes do not attack human beings, and they usually retreat at the sight of a person. Human residents of the jungle sometimes follow dholes when they are hunting. When the dhole completes its kill, the human hunters scare it away and steal its kill.
There are 10 subspecies of the dhole ranging in color and size. Two of the subspecies are listed as endangered by the IUCN: the East Asian dhole and West Indian dhole. Two other subspecies are on the verge of extinction (C.a. primaerus, and the C.a. laniger). /=\

The dhole (Cuon alpines) is a canid endemic to Southeast, Central, and East Asia.
It bears other English names, which include the Asiatic wild dog, Asian wild dog, whistling dog, Indian wild dog, mountain wolf, and red dog.
It is believed to be genetically close to species within the genus Canis but is different in several anatomical aspects; its skull is not concave but rather convex in profile and lacks the third molar.
During the Pleistocene, the dhole occurred throughout North America, Europe, and Asia but became restricted to its historical range 12,000 to 18,000 years ago.
Dholes are social animals that live in large clans without any form of rigid dominance hierarchies.
The clans created by the dhole also consist of multiple breeding females.
A clan’s usual number of individuals is 12, although over 40 individuals are known.
It is a diurnal pack hunter; they hunt both during the day and night.
Dholes target medium and large-sized ungulates. The dhole competes with leopards and tigers in tropical forests.
It is listed on the IUCN Red List as Endangered because its population is decreasing, with fewer than 2,500 adults.
Factors contributing to this decline include loss of prey, habitat loss, persecution due to livestock predation, competition with other species, and disease transfer from domestic dogs.
The dhole is said to have the combined physical characteristics of the red fox and the grey wolf, although it has also been described as cat-like because of its slender limbs and long backbone.
The dhole has a wide and massive skull with a developed sagittal crest. Compared to other canid species, the dhole masseter muscles are highly developed, which gives it an almost hyena-like appearance.
Adult females can weigh 22 – 37 lb (10 – 17 kg), while slightly larger males may weigh 33 – 46 lb (15 – 21 kg). The average weight of adults from three small samples was 33 lb (15.1 kg). Occasionally, the dhole can be said to be sympatric with the Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes).
The Indian wolf is one of the smallest species of the grey wolf. Dholes stand 430 – 560 mm (17 – 22 in) at the shoulder and measure 0.91 m (3 ft) in body length. Its ears are fairly rounded but less so than the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).
In winter, the brightest hues occur, although the general tone of the fur is red. The chest, throat, belly, flanks, and upper parts of the limbs are all less brightly colored. The forehead and muzzle are greyish-reddish.
The tail is fluffy, luxuriant, and reddish-ocherous with a dark tip. The summer coat is darker, shorter, and coarser, and the lateral and dorsal guard hair in adults is 20 to 30 mm long.
The dhole is known to produce whistles resembling the calls of the red fox, and sometimes it renders the coo-coo sound. This sound is assumed to help coordinate the pack when traveling through a thick bush, although how the sound is produced is still a mystery.
The dhole produces the KaKaKaKAA sounds. It produces other sounds such as growls (warning), whines (food soliciting), yapping cries, chattering, and screams (both of which are alarm calls).
Distinct from wolves, dholes do not bark or howl but have complex body language. Submissive and Friendly greetings are accompanied by lowering of the tail, horizontal lip retraction, and licking.
Threatening or aggressive dholes raise the hairs on their backs, keep their tails horizontal or vertical, and pucker their lips forward in a snarl. When afraid, dholes flatten their ears against the skull, pull their lips horizontally, and tuck their tails.
Dholes’ mating season in India occurs between mid-October – January. Distinct from wolf packs, dhole clans may contain one or more breeding females.
More than one female dhole may rear their litters together in the same den. During mating, the female takes a crouched, cat-like position.
The gestation period may last 60 to 63 days, with litter sizes averaging 4 – 6 pups. Compared to the wolves, the growth rate of dhole is much faster, but it is similar to that of coyotes.
Dhole pups are suckled for 58 days. During this time, the pack provides food for the mother at the den site. The pups remain at the den site for 70 to 80 days.
By the age of 6 months, pups follow the adults on hunts; by 8 months, they assist in killing large prey like the sambar. The lifespan of a dhole in captivity is 15 to 16 years.
Prey animals in India include sambar deer, chital, mouse deer, muntjac, wild boar, barasingha, water buffaloes, gaur, cattle, banteng, goats, nilgai, Himalayan field rats, Indian hares, and langurs. In the Tarbagatai Mountains and Tian Shan, dholes prey on arkhar, Siberian ibexes, maral, roe deer, and wild boar.
In the Sayan Mountains and Altai, they prey on reindeer and musk deer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on Manchurian wapiti, roe deer, musk deer, wild pig, and reindeer, while in Primorye, they feed on goral and sika deer. In Mongolia, they prey on Siberian ibex and argali.
Similar to African wild dogs but different from wolves, dholes do not attack people. Dholes eat vegetables and fruits more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various herbs, grasses, and leaves for pleasure, not just when ill.
It is found in southern and eastern Asia, from the Malay Peninsula in the south to Siberia in the north. Dholes occupy various habitats and climates, including scrub, dense forests, alpine regions, and steppes.
Depending on their habitat, they vary in color from rust-red to charcoal grey to sandy beige.

Dholes, wild dogs native to Asia, are lean and lithe canines about the size of a German shepherd.
These predators have auburn fur, a black tail, amber eyes, and upright, rounded ears.  Dholes—pronounced “DOLES”—are most genetically similar to African wild dogs.
Dholes live primarily in fragmented populations in southern and eastern Asia, and can adapt to many different landscapes, including forests, shrublands, and high mountain steppes. They den underground, sometimes repurposing old burrows left behind by hyenas or other animals.
The canines are very social, living in packs of various sizes, even as small as two. One study on pack size in India, which has the highest dhole population, reported that dhole packs were smaller—around six individuals—where tigers were more abundant, and larger—about 17 animals—where tigers were fewer. This suggests competition with tigers for prey keeps dhole packs smaller.
Dholes are hypercarnivores, meaning their diet is at least 70 percent meat, including such diverse species as ibex and hare.
As cooperative hunters, groups of three to five dholes will split off the pack to hunt together. To keep in touch while hunting, the dogs use a repertoire of vocalizations that include yaps, squeaks, growls, and chatter.
They also make distinctive whistling sounds that have earned them the nickname “whistling dogs.”
There is usually one dominant, monogamous breeding pair in a pack. In cases with more than one breeding pair, females will den and raise their pups together. The rest of the pack does not breed, instead supporting the dominant pair and their pups, bringing them food and staying behind with the pups while others hunt.
Females go into estrus sometime between December and January, at which time the dominant couple vocalize and chase each other before mating. Gestation lasts two months, and females produce litters of between four and 10 pups.
Dholes raise their young in dens, nursing pups for six months while the clan brings food to the mother. The pups leave the den at three months and join the hunt at seven months. They reach sexual maturity after they’re a year old and begin breeding at two to three years old.
Dholes are considered endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, with only between 949 to 2,215 adults in the wild. They’re extinct in 75 percent of their historic range, and remaining populations are isolated into pockets of protected or undeveloped land.
Because these carnivores need a large home range to hunt and mix with other dhole populations, they’re most threatened by human development that further isolates them, such as rubber and palm plantations and infrastructure developments.
Intense human hunting of dhole prey, such as wild boar, has diminished the carnivores' food base in many places. Livestock owners often kill dholes—including shooting, poisoning, and snaring if they predate or are thought to predate on domestic animals.
But there are some bright spots.
A scat sample recently collected in Kyrgyzstan belonged to a dhole, a surprising discovery that occurred over 600 miles north of the dog's usually range. This finding—the northernmost known record of dholes—could mean that there are unknown populations of the canines.
Conservationists are also embracing local education and community projects to promote co-existence with dholes. In Nepal, scientists work with local people to reduce poaching and conflict.
Dholes can urinate while standing on their two front paws.

"Dholes live in social units called packs. And this social construct is extremely important for them." Photograph: Ganesh Balakrishnan
The Dhole or the Asiatic Wild Dog is a formidable predator of the Indian jungle. Those of us who have seen this fantastic beast in the wild and are familiar with its habits can vouch for the strong emotion that it evokes. But how did the Dhole get its name? It is not fully clear. Its Latin name Cuon alpinus loosely translates to the "dog-like animal from the mountains." Although commonly referred to as a "wild dog," the Dhole is not a true dog. Its closest relatives are the painted dogs of Africa and the bush dogs of South America. The word 'Dhole' itself may be a misnomer derived from thola, the Kannada word for wolf.
Dholes live in social units called packs. And this social construct is extremely important for them. Typically, packs have 6-8 individuals. But these numbers can vary drastically depending on location, season, prey numbers and intensity of competition with other large carnivores like the tiger. Current knowledge hints at packs generally comprising an alpha male and female which are at the top of the pecking order. These two individuals mate and reproduce, while the other members of the pack (most of them related to either of the alphas) partake in hunting, defending their territory and raising the alpha pair's pups.
Dholes are hypercarnivores - most of their diet includes the meat of other animals. They are extremely efficient hunters and are capable of catching, incapacitating and eating up prey animals that are more than ten times their size. Individual Dholes and smaller packs hunt down small animals like hares or Mouse Deer. Medium to large-sized packs often hunt deer like the Sambar and Chital, and occasionally, even the massive Gaur. Dhole diet also varies based on location. While the Sambar Deer is the most common prey species on their menu, Dholes in central India tend to eat a lot more primates, while those in northeast India consume more domestic livestock compared to other parts of the country.
Carnivores that live in social groups are usually adapted to thrive in relatively open habitats like savannah grasslands, open scrub, or woodlands with sparse vegetation. But the Dhole is peculiar in that it requires forest habitats across most of its range. Dholes are extremely habitat-sensitive and forest-dependent. They seldom survive if forest habitats are degraded or cleared. In India, almost all Dhole populations are therefore found in the forests of Western and Eastern Ghats, central India and northeast India.
Unfortunately, most Dhole populations are now restricted to Protected Areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. But this does not mean that they do not occur in other locations outside our parks. Across their range in India, smaller populations continue to live in fragmented, unprotected forests and agroforests like coffee and tea plantations. Individuals dispersing from Protected Areas may be using these secondary habitats' to move from one location to the other. Unprotected forests and agroforests are therefore very important for maintaining connectivity between Dhole populations.
The dog may be man's best friend, but the dhole has a twisted relationship with humans. Literary accounts such as Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book paint a gory, vile image of the animal. But in modern times, many people are either unaware of its existence, are indifferent to it, or view it with measured disdain for somewhat justifiable reasons. In southern and central India, Dholes have a neutral relationship with people, usually avoiding areas with human activity. But in northeast India, Dholes are more frequently involved in killing domestic animals and are therefore despised. Nonetheless, Dholes play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of forest ecosystems, making their existence beneficial to us in the long run.
Dholes share space with tigers and leopards across large parts of their range in India. Much like cats and dogs in our neighbourhoods, these wild cats and wild dogs do not always get along. They chase each other away from kills; tigers kill and sometimes eat dholes, and dholes harass and chase leopards up trees. How then have they managed to coexist in the same spaces for so long? Recent research shows that they try to avoid each other as best as they can, by consuming slightly different prey animals, and being active in locations and time periods such that they don't frequently run into each other. All they need is well-protected forests and sufficient prey animals. Perhaps we should all take a leaf out of their book and learn a thing or two about coexistence!
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the Dhole as an Endangered species. In other words, India's wild dogs are not faring all that well. While we do not have exact population counts, experts believe there may be 4000-10,000 Dholes left in the wild, with only 1000-2000 adult individuals capable of reproducing (alphas). Although Dholes are found across 11 countries, with places like India, Bhutan and Thailand being hotspots, none of the range-countries have dedicated conservation initiatives targeted or tailor-made to save the Dhole.
One would think that a fascinating animal like the Dhole would have piqued the interest of many natural historians, biologists and conservationists. But this, unfortunately, is not the case. Over the past 145 years, less than 300 studies have focused on the Dhole, and nearly half of them have been in the past decade alone. Much of our understanding of their behaviour comes from the seminal work of Dr AJT Johnsingh in the 1970s and 80s. If young wildlife biologists are looking for a species to latch onto, the Dhole surely provides a fine opportunity!
India has made great strides in its conservation efforts. Considerable money and resources are spent on species like the tiger and the elephant, and these endeavours have shown certain success in recent times. Although the species has disappeared from nearly 60 per cent of its range in the past 100 years, the country still has the highest number of Dholes in the world. Yet, this underdog of India's tropical forests continues to wait in the wings, anticipating a chance to shine in the limelight. Here's hoping the next decade brings greater scientific focus, public support and conservation efforts to better understand and protect India's amazing wild dogs.
