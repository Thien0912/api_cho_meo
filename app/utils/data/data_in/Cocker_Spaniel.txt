Cocker Spaniels are a popular breed of dog known for being friendly and affectionate. If you’re a cat owner hoping to adopt a Cocker Spaniel, you may wonder how well the two will get along.
As a general answer, Cocker Spaniels can easily accept another furry member under the right conditions but it’s impossible to predict the exact relationship between two individual animals. Still, understanding their typical behaviors can help you make an informed decision, although the relationship’s success will depend on the pets’ personalities, early socialization, and previous experiences.
Today, we’ll explore the characteristics of Cocker Spaniels and cats and what to expect when introducing them. We’ve also included tips for fostering a positive relationship between the two.

Cocker Spaniels can generally get along well with cats under the right circumstances. Still, each animal has their own unique personality, experiences, and behaviors based on early socialization with other pets. So, there’s no guarantee that any two animals will get along perfectly.
When properly socialized, these dogs typically interact with cats in a friendly and curious manner. They may approach a cat with a wagging tail and attempt to sniff or lick them. Cocker Spaniels are generally not too forward towards cats and some may try to play with them.
But you must remember that they were first bred as hunting dogs. So, they have an instinct to chase small animals, including cats. This means some Cocker Spaniels may be more inclined to potentially harm your cats.
You must also keep in mind that each animal is unique, and their behavior towards each other depends on their personalities and experiences. Some Cocker Spaniels may be more inclined to get along with cats and show little interest in chasing them. Meanwhile, others may need more time and effort to develop a good relationship.
When introducing a Cocker Spaniel to a cat, take things slow and ensure both animals feel safe. This may involve keeping them separated at first. Then, you may gradually allow them to spend more time together under supervision.

When introducing a Cocker Spaniel to a cat, you must take steps to ensure peaceful coexistence. Here are some tips to help owners prevent conflict between their Cocker Spaniel and cat:
Scent-swapping is a crucial first step when introducing a Cocker Spaniel to a cat. It allows each animal to become familiar with the other’s scent before they meet in person. This can help reduce any fear or anxiety they may feel when they finally come face-to-face.
To start scent-swapping, rub a clean towel on your Cocker Spaniel. Pay particular attention to their neck, back, and tail, where their scent is most concentrated. Then, place the towel near your cat’s playing area or somewhere they spend a lot of time.
Allow your cat to sniff the towel and become familiar with your Cocker Spaniel’s scent. You can also do the reverse and rub a towel on your cat and place it near your Cocker Spaniel’s sleeping area. This will familiarize your Cocker Spaniel with your cat’s scent.
Repeat this process three or four times for a few days. This way, your pets have ample opportunity to become familiar with each other’s scent. It will reduce any fear or anxiety they may feel when meeting in person.
Introducing a new pet to the household can be an exciting time. But taking things slow is vital to ensure a smooth transition for all involved. Start in a controlled environment where you can watch their interactions closely.
One way to do this is to introduce them in a small room with a gate or a separate area of your home. This can help prevent any sudden movements that could startle either animal. You can also control their interactions by keeping the dog on a leash, in a crate, or using a baby gate to separate them.
When your Cocker Spaniel and cat are first introduced, ensure the dog is not able to approach the cat, and let the cat choose where they want to go next. Confident cats, especially in the case of puppies, may approach and sniff the dog, especially if the dog is calm and distracted with treats, while more anxious ones could take a few days or weeks to actually get close to the dog. This is fine and should not be rushed.
When they finally get to the point that they are both calm and relaxed around each other, with the dog showing no intent to chase the cat, and the cat going about their business, reward them both with treats and praise. You may now slowly allow them to sniff each other and get used to coming close to each other. You can also do this by placing their food bowls on opposite sides of the gate or in separate room areas. This will allow them to get used to each other’s presence without feeling intimidated, and by receiving a reward such as food and treats, they will begin to associate each other’s presence with a positive experience.
3. Supervise InteractionsSupervising your Cocker Spaniel and cat’s interactions will ensure they can coexist peacefully. When your pets are in the same room, keeping a close eye on them is essential, and it’s best to keep the dog on a leash until both pets are comfortable around each other. Also, be alert for any signs of aggression or over-excitement.
Aggression can manifest as growling, hissing, barking, or swatting. Over-excitement can also be a concern, as it can cause your Cocker Spaniel to chase or pounce on your cat. This will inevitably make your cat feel threatened or scared.
You must separate your pets immediately if you notice any of these behaviors. This can prevent any potential conflicts and ensure both animals’ safety. You can do this by separating them with a baby gate or placing them in different rooms.
It’s also important to know your Cocker Spaniel’s prey drive. As a hunting breed, your Cocker Spaniel may chase after small animals, including cats. If you notice this behavior, work on training and socialization to help your dog overcome this behavior with your cat.
Providing each animal with their own space helps ensure they can coexist peacefully. When animals share a space, territorial issues can arise, leading to conflict and stress. Giving each pet their own space can provide them with a haven to retreat if they feel overwhelmed or stressed.
One way to provide separate spaces is to assign specific rooms or areas of the house for each animal. For example, you can set up a cozy bed and toys for your cat in a spare room. Meanwhile, your Cocker Spaniel has a crate or a bed in the living room or another area of the house. This will prevent territorial disputes and give each pet a place to enjoy some alone time.
Ensuring each animal has separate food and water bowls, toys, and bedding can prevent resource guarding, especially from the dog. More importantly, it promotes peaceful coexistence between your Cocker Spaniel and cat.
Resource guarding occurs when an animal perceives a particular resource as valuable. So, they attempt to prevent other animals from accessing it. This can cause conflict and tension between your pets and may lead to aggression.
To prevent resource guarding, provide each animal with their own set of resources. That includes separate food and water bowls ideally not close to each other, as well as different toys and bedding. As a result, they’ll feel free from the need to compete with the other animal for access.
You should also feed your pets in separate areas of the house. This prevents any competition or aggression during mealtime. Dogs are usually the ones who don’t like having other animals next to their food bowls when they’re eating and this may cause them to lash out if the cat is just passing by. You may feed your Cocker Spaniel in one room and your cat in another or use a pet feeder to dispense food at specific times for each animal.
Positive reinforcement is a powerful tool to promote coexistence between your pets. By rewarding your pets for calm and friendly behavior, you encourage them to build a positive association with each other.
One of the best ways to use positive reinforcement is through treats. When you see your Cocker Spaniel and cat interacting well, reward each with a small treat. So, they’ll associate good behavior with treats and continue to act friendly to each other.
Besides treats, you can also use praise and playtime as rewards for good behavior. Whenever you see your pets interacting calmly, offer them lots of verbal praise. You can also engage them in a gentle play session to reinforce such interactions.
Allowing your pets to approach each other at their own pace is also crucial. This can help prevent fear, anxiety, and aggression from either pet. Each pet has a unique personality, so they may not immediately become best friends.
To help ease the introduction, keep your Cocker Spaniel on a leash and your cat in a separate room. Allow your Cocker Spaniel to sniff the room and become familiar with your cat’s scent. Meanwhile, let your cat sniff around your Cocker Spaniel’s bedding and toys.
Even if your pets don’t become instant friends, it doesn’t mean they can’t coexist in peace. Give them enough time to get used to each other and continue supervising their interactions. Over time, they may learn to tolerate each other or even become friends and play together.
If your Cocker Spaniel and cat are still struggling to get along, seek help from a professional trainer, a veterinarian, or a behaviorist. They can help identify any underlying issues behind this struggle. They can also develop a personalized plan to help your pets learn to get along.
For example, a behaviorist may recommend desensitization and counter-conditioning techniques. That involves introducing the pets inside a controlled environment and rewarding them for good behavior. A trainer or a veterinarian may also work with you to develop a reward-based training plan.

Cocker Spaniels and cats can get along nicely under the right circumstances. Understanding their behaviors can help foster a positive bond between the two.
It’s crucial to remember that every animal is unique. While some Cocker Spaniels may be more inclined to bond with cats, others may need more time and effort.
Being patient and proactive in your approach gives your Cocker Spaniel and cat the best chance at a harmonious coexistence.

Learn more about a breed that is sure to bring sunshine to your life with every wag of its tail and flutter of those sweeping lashes

Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years
Size: 16-inches (male); 15 inches (female)
Coat: Silky, medium-length, double coat
Temperament: Playful, trainable, affectionate, friendly and faithful
Exercise needs: An hour
Origin/native country: UK and US
Cocker Spaniels originated as hunting dogs and they are so-called because they were particularly useful when targeting the Eurasian woodcock. They actually split into two breeds in 1947 – the American Cocker Spaniel in the US, with their smaller ears, and the English Cocker Spaniel elsewhere with a wide, flat head. The latter is also split into working and show Cockers just to confuse matters a little more.
But then variety is the spice of a Cocker Spaniel’s life and that’s not just because they can come in many different colours from lemon to black and tan. These small sporting dogs can also perform lots of roles, aiding police forces and airport security staff thanks to their strong sense of smell. One Cocker called Tangle could even detect cancer in humans to an accuracy of 80 percent. But do they make good pets?
Cocker Spaniels are a sporting breed and they require about an hour’s worth of exercise each day. As well as taking them for walks, you should make the exercises mentally stimulating as best you can.
This can often be as simple as getting them to retrieve a ball, finding opportunities for a swim or getting them to sniff around – they have an excellent sense of smell. The older they get, the more mentally challenging the exercises can be but the aim across all age-ranges is to exhaust them and prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.
“Cocker Spaniels require moderate amounts of physical exercise each day, but they are not quite as high-energy as some other working breeds,” says vet Dr Rebecca MacMillan. “You will find that the working Cockers tend to be more athletic than show Cockers, however.”
Cocker Spaniels are generally easy to train. “I find that Cocker Spaniels are usually eager to please, so training tends to be straightforward if your approach is positive and consistent,” says Dr MacMillan.
As one of the smartest dog breeds, they’re certainly quick to learn but, even better, they speedily pick up on your cues and emotions. They will know if they’re behaving as they should and all it then takes is some positive reinforcement with the best puppy treats.

Be aware though they can get attached very quickly and they love being around humans. You’ll likely need to know how to reduce separation anxiety in dogs to ensure they remain happy.
Absolutely, Cocker Spaniels are one of the best dog breeds for families. Cocker Spaniels are known to be friendly and happy and they love interacting both with close family members and strangers. Their playful nature means they’re particularly good with children and other dogs and they’ll always put a smile on your face when you walk through the door.
“Cocker Spaniels have a friendly temperament and make great family pets,” affirms Dr MacMillan. “These dogs are known for being affectionate and easy to get along with. But, as with all dogs, early socialization is important, and this will help shape your dog’s attitude toward people and other animals.”

Cocker Spaniels have a double coat and they shed moderately all year round. It would be a good idea to try and pick up one of the best vacuum cleaners if you bring this breed home but, if you brush this breed regularly – “at least every couple of days,” says Dr MacMillan – then you can help minimise the mess.
Brushing also ensures their long silky coats don’t become matted or tangled and it can remove debris too, especially if they exercise in the countryside.
“They are prone to picking up grass seeds and burrs, especially in the feathery bits around their paws and legs,” says Dr MacMillan. “Keeping your dog’s fur trimmed can help prevent tangling and make it easier to spot grass awns. You may want to consider having your Cocker regularly clipped by a groomer to keep things in order.”
There are a few common health complaints that you need to be aware of with Cocker Spaniels, the most prominent being ear problems.
“Their characteristic floppy ears trap warmth and moisture, which creates the perfect environment for ear infections,” says Dr MacMillan.
But that’s not all. Like many other pedigree breeds, hip dysplasia and patella luxation are also frequently diagnosed.
“Cocker Spaniels are prone to hereditary eye issues such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), too, which can lead to loss of vision," says Dr MacMillan. “Choosing a puppy from a reputable breeder who has done all the recommended health screening is essential. This will greatly reduce the risk of your pup developing problems.”
Cocker Spaniels are people pleasers who adore praise and lavish their owners and families with love and affection. They like to snuggle on a sofa and they are wonderful with children which makes them a wonderful fit in any home. Sure, this breed is not much of a guard dog and it will keep you on your toes to some degree. It can also leave your interiors covered in hair. But thanks to their intelligence – both practical and emotional – you’ll find Cocker Spaniels are richly rewarding.

Cocker Spaniels are one of the most recognizable and popular dog breeds worldwide. Known for their joyful temperament, affectionate nature, and stunning coats, Cocker Spaniels make excellent family pets and versatile working dogs. In this article, we will dive deep into the English Cocker Spaniel and American Cocker Spaniel, shedding light on their histories, characteristics, care requirements, and health concerns. Whether you're considering getting a Cocker Spaniel puppy or are simply curious about this amazing breed, this guide has you covered.
The Cocker Spaniel, initially bred as hunting dogs to flush upland birds, has a long and rich history. The term "Cocker" comes from the woodcock, a type of upland bird these dogs were originally trained to hunt. Over time, Cocker Spaniels were selectively bred for their skills, temperament, and ability to work in the field. They were originally part of the land spaniel group, which includes other breeds like the English Springer Spaniel.
The English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel evolved as separate breeds, each with distinct characteristics. The English Cocker Spaniel retains much of the original hunting dog lineage, while the American Cocker Spaniel was refined in the United States for its show dog qualities, particularly its smaller size and longer coat.
While both types of Cocker Spaniels share a common ancestor, there are notable differences between the English and American varieties. The English Cocker Spaniel is typically taller, with a more athletic build and a longer muzzle, while the American Cocker Spaniel has a shorter muzzle and a more compact, rounded body. These differences are due to selective breeding for specific traits in the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the English Cocker Spaniel Club.
The American Cocker Spaniel became a popular choice for families looking for a friendly dog with an adaptable nature. In contrast, the English Cocker Spaniel remains a strong contender in the field of sporting dogs and gun dogs, prized for their stamina and precision in the field.
One of the main reasons why Cocker Spaniels are so adored is their temperament. They are known to be a friendly dog that thrives on human companionship. Whether you're a first-time dog owner or an experienced handler, Cocker Spaniels can easily fit into a variety of households.
These dogs are affectionate, playful, and sociable, making them an ideal choice for families with children or other pets. Cocker Spaniel puppies are especially gentle and eager to please, which makes training easier with the right approach. However, like all dogs, they do require regular grooming, especially considering their long, silky coat.
One thing to keep in mind when adopting a Cocker Spaniel is their grooming needs. These dogs have a long coat that requires regular maintenance. Whether you have an English Cocker Spaniel or an American Cocker Spaniel, you will need to ensure that their coat is kept clean and tangle-free. Regular grooming is essential to maintain their silky fur and prevent matting. Many Cocker owners choose to visit a professional groomer to help manage this aspect of dog care, particularly when preparing for dog shows or other events.
Additionally, Cocker Spaniels shed moderately, and their long coats tend to attract dirt and debris. Regular brushing can help minimize shedding and keep the coat looking pristine.
Another important grooming task for Cocker Spaniels is cleaning their ear canals. These dogs are prone to ear infections due to their floppy ears, which can trap moisture and dirt. Routine ear cleaning is essential for maintaining their health and preventing any discomfort or infections.
Like many purebred dogs, Cocker Spaniels can be prone to certain health conditions. Some of the most common health issues include hip dysplasia, which affects both the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel. This hereditary condition causes joint pain and can lead to arthritis if left untreated. Regular check-ups with a veterinary professional and appropriate weight management can help minimize the risk.
As sporting dogs, Cocker Spaniels are active and need regular exercise to stay fit. However, they are also prone to obesity, especially if they are not provided with enough physical activity or are overfed. Keeping a consistent exercise routine and a balanced diet is crucial to their overall health.
Both the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel have distinct roles in the dog world. While the American Cocker Spaniel is popular in the show ring, praised for its refined appearance and elegant coat, the English Cocker Spaniel is more often seen in the field, where its skills as a pointing dog come to life.
The Cocker Spaniel Club plays a significant role in promoting these dogs, whether it’s for companionship or as sporting dogs. Their participation in field trials and hunting events showcases their skills in retrieving and flushing out birds. If you're looking for a dog with hunting instincts, the English Cocker Spaniel is a fantastic choice, while the American Cocker Spaniel may be better suited for show and family life.
Cocker Spaniels come in a variety of colors and patterns, which adds to their appeal. Some common colors include solid color varieties like blue roan, black, and white Cocker Spaniels, while others may have tan points or other color markings. These dogs are often seen with a long coat that can be styled in many ways depending on the owner's preference.
Cocker Spaniels are generally known for their friendly and sociable nature. As a friendly dog that enjoys human companionship, they tend to get along well with other pets, including cats and other dogs. However, like all dogs, they need to be introduced to new pets in a calm and controlled manner, especially if there are two dogs in the household.
Their sociable temperament makes them a popular choice for families with children and other breeds of dogs. That said, they do need time to adjust to new environments, so proper introductions and supervision are important, especially in multi-pet households.
Both English Cocker Spaniels and American Cocker Spaniels are frequently seen in the show ring, thanks to their stunning appearance and elegant demeanor. The English Cocker Spaniel Club and the Cocker Spaniel Club are two prominent organizations that oversee the breed's standards, ensuring that dogs meet the criteria set forth by the AKC.
In the show ring, the breed standard for Cocker Spaniels includes traits such as a well-proportioned head, long flowing coat, and graceful movement. Breeders often aim for dogs with specific features, like the longer muzzle of the English Cocker Spaniel or the more compact build of the American Cocker Spaniel.
Cocker Spaniels come in a range of colors and patterns, adding to their appeal. You may encounter a white Cocker Spaniel, one with tan points, or even a blue roan Cocker Spaniel. These color variations make it easy for potential owners to find a dog that matches their preferences. The solid color or mixed-color patterns are all accepted, depending on the breed standard.
If you’re looking for a friendly dog that is loyal, affectionate, and versatile, the Cocker Spaniel could be the perfect match for you. Whether you choose the American Cocker Spaniel for its show dog potential or the English Cocker Spaniel for its hunting prowess, you’re getting a loving and devoted companion.
As with any breed, it’s important to do your research and consider your lifestyle before adopting. Cocker Spaniels require regular grooming, exercise, and attention to their health. But with the right care and commitment, they make wonderful pets that bring joy to any home.

The Cocker Spaniel, or the American Cocker Spaniel, is a small-sized Spaniel breed and the smallest member of the sporting group. Standing 13 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder and weighing between 20 to 30 pounds, the Cocker Spaniel is compact and athletic. This breed is active, affectionate, energetic, and always eager to participate in family activities. They thrive on human companionship and are known for forming strong bonds with their owners.
The American Cocker Spaniel’s temperament is friendly, quiet, playful, and devoted. Although they have a reputation for being very easygoing dogs, like all breeds, socializing your Cocker Spaniel puppy from an early age is crucial. This breed is generally sociable and affectionate towards people and other pets when well-socialized. Without proper exposure, they may develop shyness or fearfulness. Positive interactions and experiences with different environments, people, and animals are essential.
It’s always advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you’re searching for Cocker Spaniel puppies, choosing a reputable breeder is crucial. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Cocker Spaniel breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The Cocker Spaniel holds a special place as the smallest member of the American Kennel Club Sporting Group and has captured the hearts of many pet owners across the United States. Remember the endearing female lead in Lady and the Tramp? It’s no wonder the model of an affectionate and pampered pet was a Cocker Spaniel. In the late 1930s to the 1950s, the Cocker reigned as the top AKC-registered breed. While its popularity declined for about three decades, it experienced a resurgence in the mid-1980s, briefly reclaiming the number-one status until Labrador and Golden Retrievers took over in 1992. The Cocker remains among the top 15 registered breeds, and it’s not difficult to see why. A well-bred Cocker Spaniel is an absolute joy to have as a companion, boasting a merry and sound temperament.
With its flowing and handsome coat, the Cocker Spaniel is a loving and gentle breed that seeks nothing more than to make its family happy. Despite being part of the Sporting Group, it is smaller in size, weighing between 20 to 30 pounds, making it a perfect fit for apartment living or smaller homes. While primarily a devoted companion, the Cocker is versatile and can excel in conformation show rings, obedience and agility competitions, and fieldwork. Moreover, it excels as a therapy dog, bringing comfort and joy to those in need.
Originally considered one with the English Cocker Spaniel, the American Kennel Club recognized the breed as distinct in 1946. The typical Cocker Spaniel is known for its gentle and trustworthy nature, making it an ideal family pet that gets along well with children, other animals, and the elderly.
However, its immense popularity has attracted some unscrupulous breeders who disregard temperament, health, and conformation in their breeding practices. As a result, some Cocker Spaniels suffer from serious health and temperament issues. If you are considering adding a Cocker Spaniel to your family, you must be extremely cautious about where you purchase or adopt a puppy. Reputable breeders prioritize temperament and perform various health tests on their breeding dogs to ensure they don’t pass on genetic diseases. Always buy from reputable breeders and avoid backyard breeders, puppy mills, or pet stores. By choosing wisely, you can welcome a wonderful and cherished companion.
Due to their widespread popularity, it becomes crucial to research breeders diligently and find one committed to enhancing the Cocker Spaniel breed. These sensitive dogs can sometimes display nervousness, even if they come from a reputable breeder and have received proper socialization. It’s not uncommon for Cockers to exhibit submissive urination when excited, so be prepared for this behavior.
Cockers have a tendency to bark, so including a “Quiet” command in their training repertoire is essential. They are highly eager to please and enjoy being close to their families. However, being originally bred as hunting dogs, it shouldn’t surprise you if your Cocker chases birds or small animals during walks. Always keep them on a leash unless in a secure, fenced area.
The Cocker Spaniel possesses a gentle and “soft” personality, making harsh training methods counterproductive and likely to instill fear. Opt for gentle, consistent training to achieve the best results with these affectionate dogs.
While the Cocker Spaniel’s long ears contribute to their beauty, they can also pose potential health issues. Regularly checking their ears for infections is essential to keeping them healthy and comfortable.
Maintaining the Cocker’s beautiful coat requires significant effort and expense. Expect to enlist the services of a professional groomer and dedicate time to daily brushing to keep their fur in top condition.
To ensure you have a healthy and happy pet, it is crucial to avoid purchasing puppies from backyard breeders, puppy mills, or pet stores. Instead, seek out reputable breeders who conduct genetic health tests on their breeding dogs and prioritize good temperaments. This careful approach will lead you to a wonderful and well-cared-for Cocker Spaniel.
The modern Cocker Spaniel traces its roots back to the ancient Spaniel family, believed to have originated in Spain, hence the name “spaniel,” meaning “Spanish dog.” By the 1800s, Spaniels were classified into two groups: toys, serving primarily as companions, and large hunting dogs, further divided into land and water spaniels. The Cocker Spaniel earned its name due to its exceptional hunting abilities, particularly in pursuing woodcock.
In England, spaniels were considered a functional category rather than individual breeds for many centuries. It was only in 1892 that the Cocker Spaniel was officially recognized as a distinct breed in England, with the Obo Kennel of Mr. James Farrow being the first to gain recognition for these dogs.
In the late 1870s, American enthusiasts started importing English Cockers to the United States. The breed’s popularity grew rapidly, leading to the formation of the American Spaniel Club in 1881, initially including breeders of various Spaniel types. As differences among Spaniel breeds became more defined, separate organizations were formed.
Over time, some breeders favored a smaller type of Cocker Spaniel with slightly different conformation, particularly flashy in the show ring. In 1936, English Cocker breeders established the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America, gaining AKC recognition for the English type. They resolved not to breed English Cockers with American-type Cockers, further solidifying the distinction.
In 1939, CH My Own Brucie, a black Cocker Spaniel, achieved remarkable success at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show, captivating the American public with his charm. Brucie’s triumph contributed to the soaring popularity of Cocker Spaniels and shifted American breeders’ focus more towards breeding for the show ring than fieldwork.
The increasing divergence between American and English Cockers prompted the American Kennel Club to formally recognize them as two separate breeds in 1946, solidifying the distinct identities of the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel.
The American Cocker Spaniel is a charming breed. Males typically stand 15 inches tall at the shoulder, while females are slightly smaller at 14 inches tall. Both males and females weigh 24 to 28 pounds, making them compact and delightful companions for any family. Their endearing size and gentle nature add to their appeal, making them a beloved breed among pet owners.
The well-bred Cocker Spaniel boasts a sweet temperament that effortlessly wins hearts. Affectionate and cuddly, this delightful dog thrives on being an active part of family activities. Playful, alert, and ever-active, the Cocker happily engages in various exercises, whether a brisk walk or the thrill of hunting in the field.
Given the Cocker’s sensitive nature, both mentally and physically, gentle and considerate handling is essential. Harsh treatment is best avoided, as it can lead to undesirable reactions such as growling or snapping when the dog is in pain or fearful. Early socialization and proper training are vital to instill appropriate canine manners and ensure a well-balanced and well-behaved companion.
To bring out the best in the Cocker’s personality, treating them with care and kindness is crucial, as their “soft” disposition requires understanding and patience. In return, they offer boundless love and loyalty, making them cherished members of any loving family.
Like all dog breeds, Cocker Spaniels can be generally healthy but susceptible to certain conditions and diseases:
The Cocker Spaniel is well suited to living in an apartment or condo — though, of course, he loves to share a house and yard. Although he doesn’t need vast space to roam, he does need daily activity. A daily romp in the yard, along with a brisk 30-minute walk, can keep him happy and trim. Then bring him inside with you — the Cocker is not pleased to be left alone outdoors for the day, and he may respond by digging or barking to keep himself amused. He’s most content when he’s with his family, participating in the group’s activities. Despite his beautiful locks and cute, round eyes, the Cocker Spaniel is a hunter at heart. He is also a good candidate for many canine sports, especially agility and obedience competitions, hunt tests, flyball, or tracking. Like most dogs, the Cocker is better behaved when active than when he’s allowed to get bored, which can lead to such behavior problems as barking, digging, and chewing.
The recommended daily amount of high-quality dry food for a Cocker Spaniel ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 cups. However, it’s important to be cautious, as Cockers have a hearty appetite and may overeat if given the opportunity. Their skillful use of big, brown eyes in begging for tidbits can melt anyone’s resolve, but it’s crucial not to give in, as an overweight Cocker can lead to health issues. To ensure you’re feeding your Cocker Spaniel appropriately, refer to our guidelines for selecting the right food, feeding a puppy, and feeding an adult dog.
Keep in mind that the exact amount your adult Cocker consumes depends on factors like size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Just like people, dogs are individuals, and their food requirements differ. Active dogs will need more food than couch potatoes. Moreover, the quality of the dog food you choose also plays a significant role. High-quality dog food provides better nourishment, meaning you’ll need to serve less in your dog’s bowl. Remember to focus on providing the best nutrition for your furry companion to ensure their overall health and well-being.
Few breeds can match the elegant appearance of a well-groomed Cocker Spaniel. Their thick, sometimes wavy coat adds to their charm, with shorter fur on the head and back and longer tufts on the ears, chest, belly, and legs. The coat comes in solid colors such as black, light cream, red, or brown, and parti-colors with white combined with two or more colors. However, grooming a Cocker Spaniel can be an intensive and potentially expensive undertaking. Many owners choose to have professional groomers bathe, brush, and trim their dogs’ coats every six to eight weeks, given the time and effort required for this breed. Daily brushing at home is also essential to prevent tangles and mats.
If you are unprepared for a substantial grooming commitment, the Cocker Spaniel may not be the right choice. Some owners opt for shorter coat styles to make maintenance easier, but regular trimming and bathing every six to eight weeks remain necessary to keep the Cocker looking neat.
Proper introduction to grooming at an early age is crucial for the Cocker Spaniel. Their sensitive nature makes it essential to familiarize them with handling, brushing, the sound of clippers, scissoring, and other grooming tasks from a young age. Positive and kind lessons will help them become more cooperative during grooming and vet visits.
Regular care should include monthly nail trimming and weekly ear checks for dirt, redness, or odors that may indicate an infection. Cocker Spaniels are prone to ear infections, so attentive monitoring is vital. Wiping the ears with a cotton ball dampened with a gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner can prevent problems. Using deep, narrow bowls for food and water can keep the ears dry and free from food particles, and some owners even use a snood to protect the ears while the Cocker eats. With proper grooming and care, the Cocker Spaniel will continue to exude its handsome and captivating appeal.
The popularity of the Cocker Spaniel as a family dog is well-deserved due to their excellent compatibility with children. When raised together and treated kindly and respectfully, the Cocker gets along famously with kids. However, because of their sensitive nature, it’s crucial that a responsible adult closely supervises all interactions between the Cocker and children. This ensures that both the dog and the children have a safe and enjoyable experience together.
Moreover, the Cocker Spaniel is known for its ability to get along with other family pets when introduced properly and with proper training. Whether with dogs, cats, or small animals, the Cocker’s friendly disposition allows them to form positive relationships with their furry companions, making them a harmonious addition to multi-pet households.
Cocker Spaniels are often bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. Many Cocker Spaniels are in need of adoption or fostering. We have not listed a number of rescues, and many can be found with a quick internet search.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems or socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.
