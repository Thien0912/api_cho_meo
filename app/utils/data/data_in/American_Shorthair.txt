Cat Breeds
Friendly, personable, and easy to care for, the American Shorthair cat shares many things in common with the Domestic Shorthair. The main difference is that American Shorthair cats always share common characteristics with one another, while Domestic Shorthair cats display various traits from the breeds in their backgrounds.
This can cause some confusion as the American Shorthair was originally named the Domestic Shorthair. The truth is, American Shorthair cats are a breed of their own!
American Shorthair cats have no special nutritional needs in comparison to most other domestic cats. We recommend feeding your American Shorthair cat a healthy, balanced diet of high-quality cat food.
American Shorthair cats offer low maintenance in the grooming department. While you can get away with never brushing this cat, we recommend using a fine, or a soft brush to remove loose hair from your pet's coat at least once per week. This helps keep your furniture cleaner, plus it reduces the likelihood of hairballs.
American Shorthair cats are moderately active by nature. Without enough exercise, this breed is prone to obesity. You can help prevent this by ensuring that your American Shorthair cat has access to toys, and by encouraging active play.
These cats come from a long line of hunters and they appreciate interactive toys and laser beams. Like other cats, the American Shorthair loves to climb. A cat tree will save your drapes from damage while giving your pet the perfect vantage point and a cozy nap spot.
While American Shorthair cats generally enjoy good health, they are prone to a few issues, with obesity being the most common.
There are two other known health problems that occur in American Shorthairs: Hereditary hip dysplasia affects some members of the breed, and a form of cardiac disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes some American Shorthairs to have enlarged hearts. These problems affect only a small percentage of cats, yet they are worth mentioning.
When European colonizers first came to America, they arrived in ships—and they brought cats with them! These hardy mousers were the predecessors to the breed we know and love today as the American Shorthair cat.
As time passed, other cat breeds made their way to America, and the American Shorthair began to stand out as a distinct breed with different characteristics that set it apart from the rest.
The original bloodline was strengthened by an infusion of British Shorthair DNA. Still, American Shorthair cats have rounder, softer body shapes then their cousins from across the pond. You probably won't be surprised to learn that American Shorthairs starred in the first cat show ever held in the United States, in 1895.
Cat fanciers recorded the first-ever breeding between two American Shorthair cats in 1904. Since then, this breed has remained one of the most popular in the United States.
Even though the breed is distinctly American, these cats are popular worldwide and is recognized by The International Cat Association.
Whatever your favorite cat color, you're likely to find an American Shorthair to match. There are more than 80 recognized American Shorthair cat colors and patterns.
Thanks to their generally good health, American Shorthair cats have long life expectancies, often exceeding 15 years.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The American Shorthair, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed American Shorthair or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase an American Shorthair, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
American Shorthair cats cost between $100–$1,000.
American Shorthair cats tend to be medium in size. A fully grown American Shorthair cat might weigh between 8–15 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 10"–14" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for American Shorthair is 12–17 years.
American Shorthair are short-haired cats. Therefore, they do not shed as much as long-haired cat breeds.
I have a domestic long hair and a domestic shorthair.  At first, they didn’t like each other.  That is now history.  They love each other dearly. When they play and run through the house, they sound like a herd of horses.  I adopted them from an animal shelter.  Both of them have FIV and no one wanted to adopt them, but I did.  They make me laugh every day and I love them dearly.  Adults and dogs cannot get FIV.  People need to learn about this cat disease. and realize that these cats need a forever home just like other cats.
That’s so sweet to hear.
T r o y is her name she’s about 3 and 1/2 months I picked her up at a humane society and they gave her shots and whatever else they had to do and thank God I had enough money because there went a $100 on her I thought it was going to pay maybe 20 or 30 I have no idea about this little kitty she’s very playful and she likes to play with my outdoor cat whiskers he’s white and black he’s about six or seven eight years old and I wanted her to have a mommy who is 15 years old and I want to but bubba the 15-year-old now she’s just look at her but leave her alone I have two doggies pebbles and ramble and they like her sometimes they sleep together and play together so I’m back to having little kitties and doggies I’m enjoying them
We have an American Shorthair and we love him completely. He’ll turn 15 on Jan 25th. In all the years we’ve had him, we’ve never once heard him growl. We also have a DSH who we got as a kitten from a local rescue. When my husband brought him home, our ASH – who was 4 months at the time and was suffering diarrhea at the time – hissed at him. That is the only time he has ever hissed, even if you accidentally step on a little foot. I wonder if that is common in ASH kitties?
Hey Pam, good observation. American Shorthair cats do tend to be very placid, friendly cats, so it doesn’t surprise me that he’s seldom hissed. Domestic shorthairs, on the other hand, haven’t been selectively bred, and there’s very little consistency in their temperaments, so I’d expect more diverse personalities from cats of this type.
--------------------------------------------------
The American Shorthair (ASH) cat is a versatile and widely popular breed recognized for their friendly demeanor, adaptable nature, and classic appearance. Originally descended from cats that sailed on ships with early European settlers, the breed evolved in the United States over the centuries. Known for their medium to large size, sturdy build, and short, dense coat, the American Shorthair is characterized by a round face, expressive eyes, and a well-balanced body.
One of the key features of the American Shorthair is their diverse coat colors and patterns, ranging from classic tabby patterns to solid colors, bi-colors, and more. The breed is low-maintenance in terms of grooming, as their short coat does not require extensive care. American Shorthairs are known for their amiable and gentle nature, making them excellent companions for families, singles, and seniors alike. They are generally adaptable to different living environments and tend to get along well with children and other pets.
When considering an American Shorthair kitten, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a cat in need. However, if you decide to purchase, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their cats. Reputable American Shorthair kitten breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their cats, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the kitties. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy kitty while discouraging unethical breeding practices.
Some cat breeds are typically independent and aloof, even if they’ve been raised by the same person since kittenhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn’t the only factor that goes into affection levels; cats who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.

If you’re going to share your home with a cat, you’ll need to deal with some level of cat hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary among the breeds. If you’re a neatnik, you’ll need to either pick a low-shedding breed or relax your standards. This furniture cover can make it easier to clean up cat hair and keep it off your sofa!

Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems. This doesn’t mean that every cat of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they’re at an increased risk. If you’re looking only for purebred cats or kittens, it’s a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you’re interested in.

Some cats are perpetual kittens—full of energy and mischief—while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful kitten sounds endearing, consider how many games of chase the mouse-toy you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other animals who can stand in as playmates. A classic wand cat toy like this one is perfect for playful felines!

Some breeds sound off more often than others with meows, yowls, and chattering. When choosing a breed, think about how the cat vocalizes and how often. If constant “conversation” drives you crazy, consider a kitty less likely to chat.

Being tolerant of children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a nonchalant attitude toward running, screaming youngsters are all traits that make a kid-friendly cat. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual cat will behave; cats from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences and personality.

Stranger-friendly cats will greet guests with a curious glance or a playful approach; others are shy or indifferent, perhaps even hiding under furniture or skedaddling to another room. However, no matter what the breed, a cat who was exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a kitten will respond better to strangers as an adult.

Some breeds require very little in the way of grooming; others require regular brushing to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a cat who needs daily brushing. You should definitely pick up this awesome de-shedding tool for cats of any hair length!

Some cat breeds are reputed to be smarter than others. But all cats, if deprived the mental stimulation they need, will make their own busy work. Interactive cat toys are a good way to give a cat a brain workout and keep them out of mischief. This scratcher cat toy can keep your smart kitty busy even when you’re not home!

Friendliness toward other household animals and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some cats are more likely than others to be accepting of other pets in the home.

They aren’t listed on the manifest, but cats were undoubtedly among the passengers and crew that disembarked from the Mayflower when it arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. Their ratting abilities made cats valued members of ships’ crews, and they may well have made their way to the New World even earlier, on ships that carried settlers to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, Spanish explorers to Florida and Vikings to Newfoundland.
Some of the descendants of those seafaring cats, known prosaically as shorthairs, or domestic shorthairs, became what we know today as American Shorthairs. Cats were valued on land as well as at sea. Farmers, shopkeepers and householders all needed a good cat to protect their stores of food from mice, rats and other vermin.
The shorthairs were solid, hardy working stock, well suited to the tough conditions that prevailed on the untamed continent. Such good hunters were they that a publication from 1634 credits them with saving a New England colony’s crops from squirrels and chipmunks.
From their coastal arrival points, they went west with settlers, and thrived. By 1895, shorthairs had made enough of a mark that they were exhibited at the first cat show in the United States. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized them as a breed in 1906. To differentiate them from random-bred cats, also known as domestic shorthairs, the pedigreed felines were given the name American Shorthair in 1966. The cats are recognized by all registries.
The American Shorthair weighs 7 to 12 pounds.
The adaptable and good-natured American Shorthair retains his hunting ability, but these days he is more likely to be a family companion, a job at which he excels. He has a middle-of-the-road temperament, being calm but not comatose. The American Shorthair is moderately active and enjoys a good playtime as much as the next cat, but he’s not overly demanding of attention or activity.
As befits a working class cat who has made good, he is smart and enjoys playing with puzzle toys and interactive toys. He has a sociable nature and isn’t the type to hide under the bed when visitors arrive. This is a placid cat but one that doesn’t especially like being carried around. Let him stand on his own four feet. He may or may not be a lap cat, but he will always appreciate having a spot next to you on the sofa or at the end of the bed.
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. American Shorthairs are generally healthy, but be sure to ask a breeder about the incidence of health problems in her lines and what testing has been done for any that are genetic in nature.
The American Shorthair’s coat is easily cared for by combing or brushing it a couple of times a week to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. The thickness of the cat’s coat and the amount it sheds vary based on climate and time of year.
Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection.
Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.
American Shorthairs like their meals, so they can easily become overweight. To prevent obesity, measure their food instead of free-feeding them. Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a dirty box may cause them to start using other places in the house instead.
It’s a good idea to keep an American Shorthair as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Keeping him indoors also protects local birds and wildlife from this talented hunter. American Shorthairs who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
The American Shorthair has the body of a working cat: stocky, muscular and strong. His build gives him the agility and endurance he needs as a first-rate stalker, and heavily muscled legs make him capable of pouncing, jumping and climbing to get his furred or feathered prey. This is a medium-size to large cat, slightly longer than he is tall. A large head with a full-cheeked face gives the American Shorthair a sweet, open expression.
He has medium-size ears that are slightly rounded at the tips and large, wide eyes. A short, thick coat comes in a large assortment of colors and patterns: solid, tabby, calico, tortoiseshell, bicolor, particolor and more. The silver classic tabby pattern is probably the most popular of them all.
The laidback but playful American Shorthair is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. He can learn tricks and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect. He will get along fine with dogs if they don’t give him any trouble.
He is a skilled hunter, but may learn to leave pet birds or other small animals alone if he is introduced to them at an early age. When in doubt, however, separation is best. Always introduce any pets, even other cats, slowly and in a controlled setting.

American Shorthairs are easy-going kitties known for their loyal and loving character. A perfect family cat who enjoys companionship and doesn’t mind busy households with children and other pets.
The ﬁrst American Shorthairs were believed to have accompanied European settlers who set their sails for North America. They were brought onboard to protect the ship's cargo from rodents. In 1906, the Cat Fanciers' Association oﬃcially recognized the ASH breed, which was at the time called the Domestic Shorthair, as one of its ﬁve registered breeds. These hardy companions received their American Shorthair name in 1966 to diﬀerentiate them from regular random-bred, domestic shorthair cats.
The American Shorthair is the ideal family cat for its social, easygoing, and aﬀectionate nature. Though not typical lap cats, they will certainly appreciate a spot next to you on the sofa. As a moderately active breed, American Shorthairs are not overly demanding of attention and tend to be good at keeping themselves entertained. When not hunting for insects and other small critters, the American Shorthair is often found spending its time lounging in the sun.
Although the American Shorthair is considered a healthy breed with very few health problems, they can be aﬀected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common form of feline heart disease. They are also prone to inherited craniofacial defects, which can range from mild dermoid cysts to more serious conditions such as cleft palates and crooked jaws (the latter results in the development of misaligned teeth).
They're often called working cats. Historically, American Shorthairs were prized for their ability to control the rodent populations on ships and farms. Along with their natural instincts, their robust, muscular build, exceptional hunting skills, and jaw strength all contributed to successfully taking on this initial "job". These days, the American Shorthair is known as a wonderful companion pet!
They are prone to weight gain. It is very important to carefully monitor their food dosage and ensure that they get plenty of exercise, as they love to eat and are prone to obesity.
The silver tabby is very popular. Silver tabbies tend to be one of the favorite  American Shorthair coat patterns, followed by the brown tabby.
They bond with all family members, but are not known to be clingy. As mentioned above, unlike most other kitties, American Shorthair cats often bond with more than just one of their favorite humans, yet are rarely needy. They love attention, playing and snuggling, but don't get too lonely if left alone for a while.

The American Shorthair is one of the most popular breeds in America. Despite their popularity, not many people know about or understand the breed. In this article, we’ll discuss the American Shorthair cat’s characteristics, where you can find one, and all the details of their overall care.
The American Shorthair is absolutely a noteworthy breed if you’re looking to buy a purebred and not adopt or rescue a domestic cat from a shelter. Let’s get to know this breed a little bit better!

8–10 inches
Weight:
10–15 pounds
Lifespan:
15–17 years
Colors:
All colors
Suitable for:
Any pet-friendly home
Temperament:

If you love cats, you can’t go wrong with the American Shorthair. They have all the classic qualities like playfulness, curiosity, and friendliness. They fit in very well with single owners or large families with other pets and children. American Shorthairs are intelligent cats that make exceptional pets and lovable companions.

American Shorthair kittens are generally pretty easy to come by. In some situations, you might not live close to a breeder. You might have to travel to purchase your American Shorthair kitten or visit rescues and shelters to see if they are available.
Before you bring an American Shorthair kitten home, they’ll need all the necessary supplies and equipment. You’ll need to ensure you have all the essentials, such as bedding, dietary supplies, toys, entertainment, a litter box, and anything else you think is necessary. Even if you adopt your American Shorthair from a rescue or shelter, you will still have to keep up with routine vet visits and ensure their daily needs are met.

The American Shorthair is a very intelligent breed. They are great problem solvers and absolutely love challenging games. They are low-maintenance pets and can easily be entertained by toys and cat trees. They love to romp around but also cuddle in your lap.
However, they are independent, making them perfect for households where people are gone during the day. The American Shorthair is capable of learning a variety of tricks, commands, and activities. If you’ve ever been interested in walking your cat on a leash, this cat will pick it up quickly. You’ll be taking walks in the park in no time.
It can be a great way to exercise your cat, making sure that they get their full dose of nature, which can alleviate a lot of bad behaviors in the home. Some of these behaviors include clawing up your furniture, being extremely erratic or hyperactive, and a laundry list of other issues that stem from pent-up energy.
Since these cats love being inside and outside, you could build a cat sanctuary that is essentially a large kennel where your cat can come inside and out at their leisure. Some people put a balcony-style cage on a window, while others build one in the backyard. No matter what you choose, it can be an enriching experience for your American Shorthair.
The American Shorthair is truly an all-around fantastic cat. They adapt to any lifestyle and are affectionate, agreeable, happy-go-lucky cats that aren’t generally fussy. American Shorthairs have a very middle-of-the-road energy level. They love to run around, but they love taking naps by a warm windowsill. They are well known for being very even-tempered and attached.
Typically, the American Shorthair doesn’t show favoritism, either. They typically get along with every family member if treated with respect. This quality makes them very good for growing families.
The American Shorthair also loves being a single companion but can also live with other pets. The only time an American Shorthair would probably not adapt to a situation is if another animal in the home was aggressive to them or they were in a predicament of abuse and neglect.
The American Shorthair’s personality makes them great at getting along with other pets. They are adaptable and adjust to a variety of lifestyles, even when they’re fully grown. Some cats might be more particular than others, and they certainly can have their fair share of personality traits.
They get along with other cats and enjoy having a playmate when their owners are at work. However, they can be a little touchy about dogs. But generally, when an American Shorthair is raised with a dog, they get along quite well. An American Shorthair is not afraid to assert themselves, either. So they won’t have a problem showing the dog that they mean business and don’t want to play.
Since an American Shorthair is a predator, they can be dangerous to have around small pets, especially unsupervised. Your cat is not compatible with smaller pets, not even ferrets. While some cats will show no predatory instinct towards the animals, it’s not worth the risk.

The American Shorthair requires high-protein, good-quality cat food to sustain and thrive. They don’t have special dietary restrictions, but some cats can develop allergies or other sensitivities requiring diet changes.
There are numerous types of cat food. Some are highly nutritious with traceable ingredients, but others contain byproducts, fillers, preservatives, and artificial dyes, which aren’t ideal for your cat.
So, when shopping for a recipe for your feline companion, consider the brand’s ingredients, traceability, and nutritional quality. It’s helpful to ask your veterinarian for recommendations so you can slim down your choices.
Your American Shorthair will require a moderate amount of exercise. Fulfilling a cat’s exercise needs is simple if you have the right tools. They require two things: interaction and stimulation.
When they want interaction, they want you to be involved in playing. You, another family member, or even another cat can fulfill this duty. They also need stimulation. Having several toys and exercise tools can help curb negative and destructive behaviors.
Luckily, cats do not require nearly as much exercise as dogs. If you make sure your cat gets 15 minutes of solid exercise a day, they will be happy and healthy. Some American Shorthairs have higher or lower energy than others, which depends on the individual.
You can easily train an American Shorthair to use the litter box. After you show them where it is, they usually don’t have a hard time. However, you will have to work diligently with your cat to achieve results when it comes to more advanced training, such as command, trick, or leash training.
But the American Shorthair is entirely capable of learning. They have an affinity for the outdoors, so leash training can be a very good way to enrich your cat’s life while keeping them safe.
Since the American Shorthair has shorter hair, maintenance is generally very simple. Some owners like to bathe their cats, while others prefer not to unless necessary. For many house cats, baths every 4 to 6 weeks are unnecessary because they aren’t opposed to the outdoor elements.
It’s important to keep your cat’s claws trimmed, but if you have issues with the process, you can ask your vet for help. As a last resort, you can take your American Shorthair to a professional groomer for claw trimming.
Remember to keep your cat’s ears clean, especially if they have problems with head shaking or ear infections. Also, dental health is often overlooked, but it is essential to brush your cat’s teeth. Like us, cats get plaque and tartar build-up on their teeth if they’re not maintained correctly. They require routine brushing, so it is a good idea to integrate this very early into your grooming routine.
The American Shorthair is a very hearty cat with a rich history. The British were thought to have brought the cats over when they were colonizing North America. The cats learned to adapt to many environmental complications that compromised their existence.
They learned to adapt well to illness and temperature to maintain and thrive.  Their genetics have created a very sturdy, healthy breed. However, every cat is different, and some can develop genetic health conditions.
One way to avoid or detect health conditions early is to take your cat to their annual vet visits for a general wellness checkup. Here is the list of conditions that can show up in the American Shorthair.

Regarding sexual maturity, males and females can spray to mark territory or attract mates. It is vital to prevent this behavior from happening because it can be very hard or impossible to break. If a female is not fixed, she will go into heat, which can cause several personality changes that can be challenging to deal with.
When a male reaches sexual maturity, he might be a little bit more temperamental or aggressive, try to escape the house, or start marking his territory. If you’re trying to decide whether you want a male or female, there are a few factors to consider. First, if cost is a concern, neutering typically costs less than spaying, and if you have a female who becomes pregnant, kittens can be expensive to care for. So, a male might work best for you.
If you prefer a more independent cat than needy, a female might be more what you’re looking for. But keep in mind that every cat is completely different, and it would be best to interact with the kitten before committing.

The American Shorthair fluctuates slightly on the list of the top 20 most popular cats but they are never at the bottom of the list. At the time this article was written, the American Shorthair ranked 12th on the list of most popular cat breeds in the USA.
American Shorthairs are very friendly and people-orientated, so they will do well with anyone who has the time to take care of a cat properly.
Sometimes, the American Shorthair is thought to be the same as their cousin. However, they are different. One of the most noticeable differences is the head shape. The British Shorthair’s head is rounder than the American’s head; plus, the British Shorthair’s nose is flatter.

Now that you know a little more about the American Shorthair, do they sound like a breed you would love in your home? Remember, this breed is an all-around incredible cat to have around in virtually any lifestyle. However, if you have smaller pets you can’t supervise or an aggressive dog, you should seek another type of pet instead.
