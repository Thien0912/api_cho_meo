The English Setter is one of the oldest breeds of gundog, with a history that traces back to the 14th century. It was developed over hundreds of years from the spaniel and was originally called a Setting Spaniel, used for finding and setting birds. They would be worked on moorland, ranging out freely in front of the hunter, quartering the ground and looking for birds. When located, they would crouch (or set) and remain motionless facing the birds, often lifting a paw to indicate the position of the quarry. The hunters would then approach and lay nets so that on a given command, the dogs would rise and drive the birds into the nets. Use of the net continued until the late 18th century, but as use of the gun replaced the net, the term Setting Spaniel was replaced by that of Setter.  The original Setters were owned by noble families who kept them for their working abilities. There is no evidence of where these dogs originated, but it is quite likely that some were brought back from the Continent (Europe/Asia) following wars during those times. The Setters did not separate into the breeds we know today until the 19th century, although there were various recognised strains of Setter, named after the aristocratic families who kept them.
Laverack Setters
The modern English Setter owes its appearance to Mr Edward Laverack (1800-1877) who developed his own strain of the breed by careful inbreeding and selective line-breeding during the 19th century. The modern show-type of English Setter is frequently referred to as the Laverack-type. He was the author of the book entitled The Setter, published in 1872. This was considered to be the definitive book on the breed and was the basis for the creation of the English Setter Standard.

Llewellin Setters
Mr Richard Purcell Llewellin (1840-1925), based his strain upon Laverack's and concentrated on developing his ideal of the working setter by breeding a number of other strains with his own. The modern-day working setter is frequently referred to as the Llewellin-type.

ESA HistoryBy the turn of the 20th century the English Setter had become established both as a working gundog and show dog. Some of the notable early breeders were from other gundog breeds but many of the renowned English Setter kennels soon became established.  In the later part of the 1940âs the was a desire for a specialist English Setter breed club, tentative suggestions were put out in 1950 by Mr & Mrs W E Webster at the Birmingham show.  Resulting from this in the spring of 1951 the English Setter Association was founded with Mr A C Crowther as President, Mr P H Holme as Chaiman and Mrs F Webster as Secretary amongst the 41 founding members.  On 29th September 1951 the ESA held its first Open benched show. In 1954 the Kennel Club granted Championship Status with the first show being held on 25th September.   At Crufts English Setters have won Best In Show on three occasions.  The first being in 1964, Sh Ch Silbury Soames of Madavale owned by Mrs Ada Williams and bred by Mr & Mrs Phillip Gardiner-Swann. In 1977 the breed was represented Sh Ch Bournehouse Dancing Master bred and owned by Mr Gordon Williams and finally in 1988  Sh Ch Starlite Express of Valsett bred by  Mrs Ann Wick and owned by Mr & Mrs Joe Watkins.  There have also been 5 Reserve Best in Show winners at Crufts the last being in 2005 Sh Ch Bournehouse Royal Colours owned and bred by Mrs P Williams and who is also the current breed record holder with 48 Challenge Certificates.
TThe sight of a working English Setter in full flow, through purple heather, in search of the glorious grouse is difficult to equal. The elegant style, with head held high, quartering from side to side into the wind to find a trace of the elusive scent. Suddenly a faint touch of smell brings the dog to a halt, head facing into the wind, then quietly and slowly drawing forward towards the source, before stiffening to set the goal. On the request of the handler the dog moves forward and causes the birds to fly. When the birds lift the Setter then falls to the ground.
This breed has a strong hunting instinct with a sensitive nature which requires careful, consistent training. Happy to live in a home environment but only truly fulfilled when given the opportunity to function using their natural ability. 
The English Setter is an expert at finding game birds, mainly grouse and partridge when the bird density is low. They are capable of covering wide areas of rough terrain at speed to locate their quarry.
Field Trials for Setters and Pointer are, in essence, a simulation of a shooting day and take part at selected times of the year. As part of the judgeâs education programme they are requested to attend a field trial, many who attend return to enjoy further days.
Other than field trials there are two further awards available to the breed. The Show Gundog Working Certificate where a dog has to have qualified for Crufts before it can apply. The dog is tested by two field trial judges and has to prove it has hunted and pointed game and is under reasonable control. The dog must not be gun shy but absolute steadiness in not called for. Once this award is gained the dog holds the title of Champion. This is not to be confused with the title of Dual Champion which is when the dog has obtained the title of both Field Trial Champion and Show Champion.For further information on 'The Working English Setter' there is a comprehensive chapter in the book "English Setters, Into The Millennium', from which the details and photograph ( FT CH Upperwood Jan the Jewel of Laverstoke on point) have been taken.

English Setters are a beloved breed known for their striking appearance and charming personality. Their origins date back to the 16th century in England, where they were bred as hunting dogs.
Their distinctive coat is one of their most recognizable features, with a beautiful combination of black and white markings. English Setters have a medium-length coat that requires regular grooming to prevent matting.
English Setters are highly energetic dogs that require regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. They need at least an hour of exercise per day, which can include running, playing fetch, or going on long walks.
English Setters are a popular breed for families due to their friendly and outgoing nature. They are great with children and make excellent companions for active families.

The English Setter is a wonderful breed that makes a great addition to many families. They're a popular choice for families with children, as they're gentle and loving.
Their friendly demeanor makes them a great fit for households with multiple pets, including cats. With proper introductions, they can live harmoniously with felines.
English Setters are highly intelligent dogs, ranking high in terms of intelligence. They're also relatively easy to train, although they can be a bit stubborn at times.
Here's a breakdown of their key characteristics:
English Setters are generally healthy dogs, but they can be prone to certain health conditions, such as hip dysplasia and eye problems. Regular veterinary check-ups and a balanced diet are essential for their well-being.
They're a relatively low-maintenance breed when it comes to grooming, requiring only regular brushing and occasional baths to keep their coat clean and healthy.
A unique perspective: Healthy Bull Terrier
English Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be prone to certain health conditions. Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition where the thighbone doesn’t fit properly into the hip joint, and elbow dysplasia is a similar condition that affects the elbow joint.
Regular veterinary check-ups and early detection are crucial to managing these conditions effectively. You should expect health clearances for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, von Willebrand’s disease, and normal eyes certified by the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) when buying a puppy from a reputable breeder.
Deafness is relatively common among English Setters, and it's essential to evaluate whether you have the time, patience, and ability to care for a deaf dog properly. If a dog is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, special aids such as vibrating collars can assist in communicating with them.
Here are some common health issues that may affect English Setters:
Regular grooming is essential for English Setters, including brushing their coat most days of the week to keep it shiny and free of matting and tangles, washing their ears weekly, and trimming their nails every month or so.
English Setters are generally a healthy breed, but like all breeds, they can be prone to certain health conditions. Hip dysplasia is a common issue, where the thighbone doesn't fit properly into the hip joint, leading to pain and lameness in the rear legs.
Take a look at this: Bernese Mountain Dog Hip Dysplasia
Hip dysplasia can be screened for by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred, so it's crucial to obtain proof of health testing from the breeder before buying a puppy.
Hypothyroidism is another condition that can affect English Setters, resulting from an abnormally low level of thyroid hormone production. Signs of this condition may include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, low energy levels, drooping eyelids, and irregular heat cycles.
Hypothyroidism can be managed with daily medication throughout the dog's life, allowing them to live a happy and healthy life. The dog's coat may become coarse and brittle, and the skin tough and dark.
Deafness is relatively common among English Setters, presenting challenges for both the dog and the owner. Special aids, such as vibrating collars, can assist in communicating with a deaf dog.
Elbow dysplasia is a heritable condition that commonly affects large-breed dogs, including English Setters. It occurs due to different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, resulting in joint laxity.
Here are some common health issues that may affect English Setters:
Regular veterinary check-ups and early detection are crucial to managing these conditions effectively.
English Setters are social dogs that thrive in company, so they're best suited for households where they'll have companions for most of the day.
To prevent separation anxiety, it's essential to help them feel relaxed when left alone for short periods.
English Setters need regular exercise to stay in shape, but their exercise needs change as they grow. From 9 weeks to 4 months, puppy kindergarten and 15-20 minutes of playtime in the yard twice a day are ideal.
As they mature, they can handle longer walks and playtime, but it's crucial to avoid overexertion, especially in hot weather.
A good schedule for exercise is key to preventing injuries and ensuring they stay healthy. For example, from 6 months to a year, playtime should be limited to cool mornings or evenings, and gradually increase the distance you walk.
Crate training is a must for English Setters, especially when they're young. It'll keep them out of trouble and help with housetraining.

To housetrain your English Setter, start early, keep them on a regular schedule, reward them with praise or treats when they potty outside, and crate them when you can't supervise.
They're moderate shedders, so regular brushing is essential to prevent tangles and mats. Brushing at least three times a week, ideally daily, with a stiff bristle brush keeps their coat lustrous and healthy.
A steel comb can gently remove any tangles or mats, and occasional baths will keep them smelling fresh.
A unique perspective: When Can You Breed a Female Dog
Dark brown eyes are considered ideal, and the darker the better. Bright eyes can give a mild and intelligent expression. Nearly round eyes are preferred, neither deep-set nor protruding.
Large eyes are a good size, fitting well within the eye socket. Eyelid rims should be dark and fully pigmented. Lids should fit tightly so that the haw is not exposed.

The hindquarters of a well-bred animal are truly a sight to behold. Wide, muscular thighs and well-developed lower thighs make up this impressive section.
The pelvis is equal in length to the upper thigh, forming a nearly right angle that's a testament to balance and harmony. In balance with the forequarter assembly.
The stifle is well bent and strong, a crucial factor in the animal's overall stability and agility. The lower thigh is only slightly longer than the upper thigh.
The hock joint is well bent and strong, a vital component in the animal's movement and flexibility. The rear pastern is short, strong, and nearly round, perpendicular to the ground.
When viewed from the rear, the hind legs are straight and parallel to each other, a sign of proper alignment and coordination. The hock joints have no tendency to turn in or out when standing or gaiting.
English Setters need about an hour of physical activity each day to stay healthy and fit. This can be divided into two periods of 30 minutes each, making it easier to incorporate into your daily routine.
They're energetic dogs and love to hike, but they don't require as much exercise as some other gun dog breeds. A vigorous session off-leash in a secure and fenced area is perfect for them.
Early socialization is key to ensuring your English Setter grows into a well-mannered adult dog. Positive reinforcement is the best training method, and they respond well to reward-based training using treats or favorite toys.
As they get older, English Setters might become less active, so it's essential to maintain a routine of physical activity that your dog will enjoy.

They are known for their unique coats that come in the color of “Belton,” which is speckles of blue, lemon, liver, or orange, usually on a white coat. They have medium-length fur with feathering on their legs, ears, chest, abdomen, and tail. They have long, elegant necks with an oval-shaped head and long muzzles and ears.


The English Setters are athletic dogs that were bred to be hunting dogs, so they require a fair amount of exercise. They are very eager to please, and therefore, training is relatively easy. They are robust and healthy dogs with a slightly longer lifespan than other dogs the same size. They are very friendly with other animals and people and are generally easygoing in nature.
If you’re wanting to own an English Setter, it is important that you only buy from a reputable breeder that can answer any questions you may have about the breed and provide health clearances. Avoid breeders that can’t provide this information, as the puppies might not be the healthiest.
They are smart, playful, and devoted dogs that can make good watchdogs but are friendly with strangers once introduced. The English Setter will not do well in an apartment and require a house with a fenced backyard. Because they were bred to be hunting dogs, leaving them alone with smaller animals or birds is risky as they might follow their instincts.
The English Setter makes a fantastic family pet. They get along very well with children as they are very patient and tolerant. They will watch over and protect the family but are not aggressive. They are gentle, calm, and good-natured dogs.
English Setters are known to be easygoing and get along well with other pets. However, as previously mentioned, be wary of birds around the English Setter because of their hunting instincts. Like any dog, the English Setter needs to be properly socialized while they are puppies. This will help them to accept and tolerate other animals into their adulthood.

The English Setter is prone to becoming overweight, which must be considered when feeding this dog. They should be fed about 2 to 3 cups of dry food broken up into 2 or 3 meals a day. If you’re concerned about how much or how often you should feed your dog, you should speak to your vet.
The English Setter is an athletic and energetic dog that needs the opportunity to run. They require a fenced area to run in, and if you don’t have access to this, running, jogging, or biking with your dog on a leash will be a great way to allow him to expend some of his energy. Several daily walks or taking him for a hike are also ways to keep your dog healthy and happy.

English Setters are easy to train as they are loyal and eager to please, and their intelligence allows them to quickly pick up training. They are sensitive dogs and, therefore, will respond best (like all dogs) to positive reinforcement. Always avoid using punishment throughout the training process.
Grooming the English Setter should include brushing them once a week, but it would be best to brush them 2 or 3 times a week. The longer fur needs to be kept tangle-free as mats will cause discomfort and can create skin problems.
The English Setter has very long, drooping ears that should be cleaned regularly as the ears might contain excess wax and oils. If you start trimming your dog’s nails and brushing their teeth when they are puppies, they will get used to these necessary grooming habits.
Minor Conditions
The English Setter is susceptible to hypothyroidism and retinal degeneration. Your vet will check your dog’s thyroid (which includes urinalysis and blood tests) and your dog’s eyes during a routine physical exam.
Serious Conditions
The English Setter is prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, deafness, epilepsy, excess cartilage, and deficient bone growth. The vet will check your dog’s hips, elbows, and hearing as well as conduct blood and urinalysis tests to check your dog’s overall health.
The female English Setter usually is smaller and lighter than the male. The female ranges from 23 to 25 inches in height and the male might be 25 to 27 inches. The female might range from 45 to 55 pounds, and the male could be 65 to 80 pounds in weight.
Spaying or neutering your dog will change many dogs’ behaviors. It is thought that after the surgery, most dogs tend to settle down and become less excitable and aggressive. Unless you’re planning on breeding your dog, they should be spayed or neutered to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
There is also the belief that the main difference between male and female dogs (other than the obvious biological difference) is in their behavior. Some believe that male dogs tend to be more aggressive and not quite as affectionate as females, but there are debates on this subject.
However, the primary determinant of how your dog’s personality is formed will be based on how the puppy was raised and socialized and how you treat your pet into adulthood.

Belton is the speckling or flecking of color on the English Setter. It comes in blue (white with black flecks), orange (white with orange flecks), liver (white with liver flecks), tricolor (blue or liver Belton with tan markings on the legs, chest, and face) and lemon (white with orange flecks and lighter-colored nose).
The English Setter comes from the Setter family (which includes four British variations) and gets its name from how it lies down, or “sets” when locating game birds.
When you take an English Setter outside, they are very active and playful but are quiet and calm dogs while indoors.

The English Setter is a loving companion and an energetic dog that will be a perfect fit for you and your family. It can act as a watchdog, alerting you to strangers but without any aggression to worry about.
Finding an English Setter breeder won’t be difficult as there are many of them scattered around the world, discoverable through Google. Just be sure to investigate any breeder you are considering.

The English Setter is a breed that combines elegance, athleticism, and a gentle temperament, making it a beloved choice for both hunters and families. Known for their striking appearance and friendly demeanor, these dogs have a rich history and a unique set of characteristics that set them apart. Whether you're considering an English Setter as a hunting companion or a family pet, this guide will provide you with everything you need to know about this remarkable breed.
The English Setter originated in England during the 19th century, where it was primarily bred for bird hunting. The breed was developed by crossing various spaniels and pointers to create a dog with an exceptional ability to "set" or point at game birds. The breed's development is often attributed to Edward Laverack and R. Purcell Llewellin, whose names are sometimes used as alternative names for the breed (Laverack Setter and Llewellin Setter).
English Setters were recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI), solidifying their status as a distinguished breed in the canine world.
English Setters are medium to large-sized dogs with a graceful, athletic build. Here are some key physical traits:
Their beautiful, feathered coat and expressive eyes make them one of the most visually appealing breeds.
English Setters are known for their friendly, outgoing, and affectionate nature. They are highly social dogs that thrive on human interaction and are generally good with children, other dogs, and even strangers. However, their high energy levels may be overwhelming for very young children.
English Setters are high-energy dogs that require plenty of physical activity to stay happy and healthy.
Tip: If you're an active person who enjoys outdoor activities, an English Setter could be the perfect companion for hiking, jogging, or even swimming.
The English Setter's beautiful coat requires regular maintenance to keep it looking its best.
Tip: Invest in a good quality slicker brush and comb to keep their feathered coat in top condition. Regular grooming sessions also provide an excellent opportunity to bond with your dog.
English Setters are intelligent and generally eager to please, but they can be a bit independent. Consistent, positive reinforcement methods work best.
Tip: Socialization is crucial. Expose your English Setter to different environments, people, and other animals from a young age to ensure they grow up to be well-rounded adults.
English Setters are adaptable dogs that can thrive in various living situations, but they do best in homes where they have plenty of space to run and play.
Tip: If you live in an apartment, be prepared to commit to multiple daily walks and trips to the dog park to meet their exercise needs.
English Setters are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, they are prone to certain health issues.
Tip: Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, and proper exercise can help mitigate some of these health risks. Be vigilant about cleaning their ears to prevent infections, especially if they spend a lot of time outdoors.
Owning an English Setter comes with various costs that potential owners should be aware of.
Tip: Consider pet insurance to help cover unexpected veterinary costs. Additionally, budgeting for regular grooming and high-quality food will ensure your English Setter stays healthy and happy.
The English Setter is a wonderful breed for the right family. Here are some specific recommendations:
The English Setter is a breed that offers a unique blend of beauty, intelligence, and affection. They are excellent companions for active individuals or families who can meet their exercise and grooming needs. With proper care, training, and socialization, an English Setter can be a loyal and loving addition to your home.

However, before adopting one, you should learn all you can about the English Setter. That’s why we’ve gathered all the relevant information you’ll need about these pups. Below, you’ll learn more about the breed’s temperament, nutritional needs, how much exercise they require, and more. Keep reading!

The English Setter is an older breed developed in the United Kingdom as a hunting dog. Country gentlemen bred them on their estates, mixing Pointer breeds with the Spaniel to make a canine that would sit (or “set”) when they found game. The English Setter’s popularity didn’t take long to grow in the UK, and they were soon exported to the United States.

When you decide to get an English Setter puppy, you’ll probably have to go through a breeder. A reputable breeder will have raised your puppy with its mother and siblings and be willing to tell you the results of any health checks done on the parents. However, going through a breeder will be a bit pricey.
You might be able to locate a puppy through a rescue organization, but a rescue organization may be more likely to have older dogs rather than puppies. You can also check the local shelters, but English Setters rarely show up at them.
Although English Setter puppies can certainly be energetic, they also love cuddles.

The English Setter is a beautiful canine, but they also are incredibly intelligent, loyal, and friendly. They are affectionate with their loved ones and always up for a quick nap or snuggle. They’re also highly energetic and need an active family to keep up with them. If the English Setter doesn’t exercise enough throughout the day, they can become bored and engage in mischievous behavior.
Because the English Setter is an intelligent sporting dog, they’re quick to pick up on commands and take great joy in learning new things. Their intelligence and desire to learn also require you to provide plenty of mental stimulation, such as outdoor games and interactive puzzles. A lack of mental stimulation can equal a bored pup!
The English Setter is a great pet for families! However, they need to be with a family who has the time to give them the exercise they need each day and a yard they can run around in; apartment life won’t suit these pups. English Setters are great with children of any age, as they’re fairly laid back. However, due to the dog’s size and playful nature, it’s vital to monitor their interactions with young children.
English Setters can be prone to separation anxiety, too, so they’ll do better in homes where someone is there more often than not.
English Setters get along well with other animals. They’ll love playing with dogs of all sizes and can even get along with felines. However, they have hunting instincts and may “hunt” pets smaller than them. Early socialization is key to ensuring your English Setter and smaller animals get along. You should never leave your English Setter alone with smaller animals, like birds or rabbits, just in case they can’t resist their instincts.

Owning a dog is a large responsibility, and you’ll need to know what to feed them, how to groom them, and what kinds of health issues they may face in the future.
As with all dogs, the English Setter will need a diet of high-quality dog food that has the protein and calories required to keep up with their energy needs. However, they can be prone to obesity, and they have a tendency to overeat. Talking with your vet about how much food to give your pup is advisable. English Setters enjoy sneaking crumbs and food off countertops and have even been known to try stealing morsels left on plates, so you must keep an eye on your food and train them to leave you alone during dinnertime.
The English Setter breed can also be prone to food allergies, so watch for any signs of allergic reactions, such as itchiness or digestive trouble.
English Setters have a lot of energy, but they don’t have as much as other sporting breeds. They need an hour or more of daily exercise to stay fit and happy. You can take your pup on long walks, let them accompany you on hikes, bring them to the dog park, or play a game of tag or fetch in the backyard.
They are quite athletic; between that athleticism and their intelligence, you’ll find the English Setter is great at sports competitions. You may want to sign them up for a training course or just set up an agility course in the backyard.
Because of their intelligence and history as hunting dogs, English Setters are relatively easy to train and can pick up new commands quickly. They’re a sensitive breed, so be sure only to use positive reinforcement rather than negative reinforcement during training. Also, be aware that their prey drive and excellent sense of smell can cause them to follow their instincts, so you’ll want to begin training them early on to ensure they don’t get into trouble.
Socialization is vital for any breed, but it’s especially important with English Setters if you have a multi-pet home with small animals. Because of their hunting instincts, the English Setter may be tempted to chase after smaller pets, but early socialization can help curb these instincts.
The English Setter has a beautiful coat, but since their hair is long, you should brush them at least twice a week, if not more. A soft-bristled brush is an excellent choice, but you might also want to invest in a metal comb with long teeth, as it can work through tangled areas. The English Setter has feathering in their coat around the ears, feet, and legs that require regular trimmings to keep it neat.
You should check your dog’s ears regularly to ensure they are clean, and baths should be given every 4–6 weeks. Their nails need monthly trimming, and their teeth should be brushed a few times a week to prevent dental issues.
The English Setter is relatively healthy but is susceptible to a few health conditions.
Personality-wise, male and female English Setters are similar, but each dog is an individual and will have their own quirks. The only significant difference between the sexes is their size; males are a few pounds heavier and a couple of inches taller. Intact males and females are likelier to display undesirable behaviors, but spaying or neutering your dog can reduce their need to mark their territory or seek a mate. Because it’s more complex, spaying is more expensive than neutering.

There’s much more to learn about this fabulous dog, so here are a few extra facts you might not have known.
English Setters are hunting dogs, but in the 19th century, people became more interested in their looks and decided to enhance their beauty via breeding.
The word “Belton” describes the flecks of color on an English Setter’s coat.
You can find dogs resembling the English Setter in artwork from the 15th century!

The English Setter is a fantastic pet for active families and single owners. As long as you have a large, fenced-in yard for them to play in and the energy required to keep up with them, the English Setter will be one happy pup! They do well in homes with multiple pets (though you will need to watch them around smaller animals). If you don’t think you can exercise one of these dogs as needed due to lack of time or other reasons, consider another breed that looks similar but has less energy.
