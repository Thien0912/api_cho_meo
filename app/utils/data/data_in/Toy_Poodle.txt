Toy Poodles combine exceptional intelligence with a loving personality in a compact, low-shedding package. They adapt well to various living situations, bond deeply with their families, and excel in training. Their long lifespan and portable size make them ideal companions.
A healthy adult Toy Poodle typically weighs between 4 to 6 pounds when fully grown. Females often fall on the lighter end of this range, while males may weigh slightly more, but all should maintain a lean, proportionate build.
The main difference is size – Toy Poodles stand under 10 inches tall and weigh 4-6 pounds, while Miniature Poodles reach 10-15 inches and weigh 10-15 pounds. Both share the same intelligence and personality traits.

Not only can an adorable Toy Poodle serve companionship to their owners, but they are also used in a number of breeding programs to create lots of Doodle hybrids.

The Toy Poodle was developed much later than their standard siblings in 20th-century America. These pups have roots in European countries, especially France, and took quite a few years to develop into the dog we know and love today.
These little dogs have the classic curly Poodle coat and weigh approximately 4 to 6 pounds as adults. As with many small dogs, owners enjoy the size of the Toy Poodle because they are easy to carry around and suitable for small living spaces.
Toy Poodle CharacteristicsEnergy+ High-energy dogs will need a lot of mental and physical stimulation to stay happy and healthy, while low-energy dogs require minimal physical activity. It’s important when choosing a dog to make sure their energy levels match your lifestyle or vice versa. Trainability+ Easy-to-train dogs are more skilled at learning prompts and actions quickly with minimal training. Dogs that are harder to train will require a bit more patience and practice. Health+ Some breeds, due to their size or their breeds potential genetic health issues, have shorter lifespans than others. Proper exercise, nutrition, and hygiene also play an important role in the lifespan of your pet. Lifespan+ Some dog breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, and some more than others. This doesn’t mean that every dog will have these issues, but they have an increased risk, so it’s important to understand and prepare for any additional needs they may require. Sociability+ Some dog breeds are more social than others, both towards humans and other dogs. More social dogs have a tendency to run up to strangers for pets and scratches, while less social dogs shy away and are more cautious, even potentially aggressive. No matter the breed, it’s important to socialize your dog and expose them to lots of different situations. 





Toy Poodle Puppies

Lookout! The Poodle is known for being one of the smartest of all the canines. From birth, a Toy Poodle will develop and grow rapidly, mentally and physically. There are several sizes of Poodle, but the Toy variation is one of the most sought-after. These adorable tiny pups only weigh roughly 3.5 ounces when they are born. Just imagine these miniature angels!
Quickly, they grow and develop and are ready for their new homes around 8- 12 weeks of age. Taking a puppy home any younger than 8 weeks could have a negative impact on their behavior. It’s very important to choose a reputable, licensed breeder with a history of healthy litters. Your puppy’s parents should have had health screening and genetic tests to reduce the risk of inherited disease in your puppy. Since this dog is very popular, they fall victim to backyard breeding.
If you get a Toy Poodle, you should always make sure that you check with the breeder to see what testing and vetting have been done up to this point. It is also important to review and get a feel for the parents’ personalities so you can see what to expect out of your own puppy. Make sure their parents are well cared for, as you don’t want to support an unethical breeder.
If you are in the market to adopt, a Toy Poodle would make an exquisite choice. You can always check with local shelter and rescue facilities to see if they have any Toy Poodles that need a new forever home.
Be very careful of pet shops and pushy or elusive breeders. With Toy Poodles being a common pure breed that is sought after, many people will sell these dogs for profit without properly caring for the mother or litter. It is important that we understand how to recognize these types of sales so we can avoid them.





Temperament & Intelligence of the Toy Poodle
When it comes to the Toy Poodle’s temperament, this breed is notorious for being just as intelligent as the standard variety. These little dogs train very easily, although they can learn to bend the rules if you are inconsistent with your training. Being very smart means they can learn to train their owner and not the other way around!
The Toy Poodle is extremely aware and intuitive. They bond very well with their human families and can get along with just about any type of animal you have in the home. Rather than being aggressive or overbearing, the Toy Poodle is often gentle and complacent.
This little dog is definitely not one of independence. They heavily rely on their owners for stimulation, affection, and anything else. They form strong bonds with their family, which may lead them to develop separation anxiety. From the start, they should be rewarded for independence and learn to be alone for short periods. These dogs are best suited for family members who will be able to spend a lot of time with them. Despite their small size, they are very energetic, and without exercise or mental stimulation, they can learn bad habits.
Are These Dogs Good for Families? 👪
The Toy Poodle is not for families who will be away from home for long periods of time. These dogs very frequently and very easily develop separation anxiety. Because they are so glued to their owner’s hip, they make very good companions for active retirees or those who work from home.
You don’t really have to worry about the size of your home, either. These dogs don’t take up much space, making them perfect for apartment living and even tiny homes. This is also the kind of dog you can tow around in a bag or backpack without breaking your spine, although we’re sure, for the most part, they would prefer to walk.
Since Toy Poodles are so affectionate and tiny, they make perfect additions to homes with smaller children. Smaller children should always be supervised with any dog and each should learn proper respect. Even a 2-year-old could seriously hurt a Toy Poodle due to their clumsiness and size difference.

Does This Breed Get Along With Other Pets? 🐶 😽
Toy Poodles can be amiable with other dogs if they are socialized from an early age. They are more people-focused than dog-focused. They are sometimes intimidated by larger dogs, particularly if they have had a bad experience, which could lead to them snapping out of fear. We recommend choosing pets that are well-matched in size, as a larger dog could injure a Toy poodle simply by accident.
Only you know your dog’s temperament so use your best judgment. Make introductions to other pets gradually and safely.





Things to Know When Owning a Toy Poodle
Food & Diet Requirements 🦴
Feed your Toy Poodle a nutritionally complete diet for their age. Puppies need extra calories and protein for growth, so feed a puppy diet until they are around 12 months old. When they are ready, you can gradually switch to food.
One thing to note is that Toy Poodles don’t need a lot of food. They are generally not food-obsessed, either. Since many owners misjudge how much to feed them, this can lead to Toy Poodles turning down meals and being seen as fussy eaters.
Ask your vet how much you should feed your Toy Poodle each day. However, if they turn down a meal and are healthy otherwise, don’t reward the behavior with more tasty food. This will lead to unhealthy eating habits.

Exercise 🐕
If you’re the kind of person who has a moderately active lifestyle, the Toy Poodle might be perfect for you. These little dogs might love running and playing, but they tend to burn out their energy pretty quickly.
On average, these dogs need between 45 minutes to 1 hour of exercise per day. You can take them on brisk walks or let them run around an enclosed environment. They will love barking and playing, burning off some steam.
Keep in mind that these dogs can tucker out pretty quickly. They can also get overheated or very cold in extreme temperatures. Since they don’t have a lot of body weight to keep them warm, you should put sweaters or raincoats on when taking them out in inclement weather.
Training 🎾
The Toy Poodle is easy to train. They are incredibly intelligent and can absolutely pick up even complicated commands. They are also extremely eager to please, which is why they have a reputation as performing or circus dogs.
If your training is inconsistent, or you tend to be a pushover, they can also walk all over you because they are so intelligent. Many of them also know they are the tiny baby of the family and take advantage of any favoritism or special treatment.
So, before getting a Toy Poodle, make sure your dog training skills are up to scratch, and remember they are learning all the time. Giving into stubborn or attention-seeking behavior is a sure way to be trained by your pet.
Grooming ✂️
Grooming is an incredibly important part of Poodle care. Poodles rarely shed and are considered hypoallergenic. No dog is 100% hypoallergenic since they all produce allergens, but low-shedding breeds will spread fewer allergens in the environment. This low-shedding trait is partially why Poodle mixes have become so popular.
While they might not shed frequently, they have long, curly coats that need daily brushing. If you leave any part of their coat long, it will require frequent maintenance. Generally, you can brush them with a slicker brush to help eliminate tangles and evenly distribute their natural oils.
Owners of curly dogs usually like to take their pets to the groomer. A professional groomer can pamper your dog while taking a lot of the headache out of it for you. You typically take your dog once every 4 to 6 weeks to get them washed, clipped, and other extras.
Weekly ear cleaning, nail trims every month or so, and teeth brushing should all be part of your grooming routine. Wipe their eyes every day or so to avoid tear staining. This keeps your Toy Poodle comfortable, healthy, and happy.

Health and Conditions 🏥
To ensure the longevity of your dog, it is very important to keep up with routine vet visits. During your Poodle’s first year of life, they will have many encounters with their vet during processes like parasite prevention, vaccinations, spay or neuter surgery, and microchipping.
Like any dog, the Toy Poodle can experience certain genetic health issues. However, with proper breeding, good care, and a bit of good luck, they can live long, healthy lives. The full grown Toy Poodle can have an impressive lifespan, extending beyond 15 years in some cases. Some common problems to look out for include:
Minor Conditions

 Allergies

Serious Conditions

 Hip dysplasia
 Progressive retinal atrophy
 Epilepsy
 Hypoglycemia
 Collapsed trachea


Male vs. Female
You might not be able to tell a male from a female just by a first glance. They are both very small, and it could be difficult to gauge the sex based on size. However, the males do tend to weigh a little more than the females.
After sexual maturity, females will enter their heat cycles, and males will become sexually mature themselves. Most vets recommend that you get them fixed before they reach this age to avoid unwanted behaviors. Females in heat cycles will bleed. So, if you don’t get your dog fixed before they enter the cycle, it is important to keep a diaper or other protective layer on them to prevent staining in the home.
Males might start mounting random stuffed animals, pillows, or other objects. They might also start marking their territory by peeing all over your home.
Aside from the mess and behaviors, spaying and neutering have health benefits. They also prevent accidental litters, which could contribute to the problem of dog overpopulation.


3 Little-Known Facts About the Toy Poodle
1. Toy Poodles can learn just about anything.
Toy Poodles are one of the easiest to train small dog breeds. They excel in many forms of training, including agility and other sports.

2. Toy Poodles are not truly hypoallergenic.
There is a common misconception that Poodles are completely hypoallergenic. While it’s true that they are much less triggering than other breeds, they might still be problematic to people with allergies.
Also, just because someone mixes a Poodle with another breed, this does not mean that the litter will be completely hypoallergenic, either. They very well could take on traits of the other parent, meaning they will shed allergens just as much as any other dog.

3. Toy Poodles are Velcro dogs.
A Toy Poodle is considered a Velcro dog. They are very attached to their owners and dislike being alone. They can also make exquisite purse dogs, as they enjoy being toted around like the princesses and princes they are.

Final Thoughts
So now you know a little bit more about the Toy Poodle. This compact little dog is incredibly intelligent and certainly companionship material. They will get along with just about anyone and can mix well with other small dogs if they are well-socialized. This makes them suitable for various families and living spaces.

The Toy Poodle is the smallest of all Poodle breeds and over the years these charming little dogs have proved to be among the most popular companions not only in the UK but in many other countries of the world too. Like the Standard and the Miniature Toy Poodles don't shed and this paired to the fact they are highly intelligent has seen these charming little dogs find their way into the hearts and homes of many people. They are also always well received in the show ring thanks to their desire to perform and please.
Toy Poodles are highly intelligent and learn new things extremely quickly which includes how to please their owners and families which all adds to their endearing personalities. They have an amazing sense of smell and at one time were trained as "truffle dogs" which saw them search find and then dig up these expensive delicacies and being so careful by nature they never damaged the truffles they found. Today the Toy Poodle has gone from strength to strength on the popularity chart although they are expensive to buy and known to suffer from quite a few health issues.
It's thought the breed’s name “Poodle” comes from the German word 'pudel' which translated means "to plash in water". However the actual origins of the breed remain a bit of a mystery but some people think the breed's ancestors originally came from the East or from Africa and that these charming dogs found their way to Europe via Portugal.
Other people think the Toy Poodle like the Standard and Miniature Poodle originated in Eastern European countries which includes Russia and there is some thought that Poodles were taken to France by German soldiers during the war and as such France is listed as their country of origin although it’s more likely that the breed first appeared on the scene in Germany. The breed is thought to be an ancient one with Poodles existing 500 years ago. Toy Poodles became popular with European Royals during the 17th and 18th century when they were kept as pets and companions along with the Miniature Poodle.
There is evidence that the larger Standard Poodle was bred to work in marshlands where they were highly prized retrievers and known as excellent "duck dogs" whereas the smaller Toy Poodle was used to find and dig up valuable and expensive truffles. In times long past they were sometimes referred to a "Sleeve Poodles" because owners kept them as hand warmers when the weather was cold.
In France Toy Poodles were used as circus dogs because they were easy to train love to entertain and be the centre of attention. Being such intelligent dogs they learn new things quickly which includes all sorts of tricks and this includes some quite complicated and challenging circus acts. Poodles have remained a popular breed throughout the centuries and for good reason. They are highly intelligent extremely loyal and real clowns of the dog world which when all added up is why they are such a pleasure to be around. Today the Toy Poodle is also still one of the most popular breeds in the showring.
Height at the withers: Males 24 - 28 cm Females 24 - 28 cm at the withers
Average weight: Males 3 - 6 kg Females 3 - 6 kg
When it comes to their coat the Toy Poodle boasts having an extremely profuse single coat that consists of short close lying thick dense and curly hair that covers their entire bodies. Their coats can be trimmed in various ways which is acceptable in the showring providing enough of a dog's coat is left for judges to determine the quality and colour of a dog’s coat. The accepted breed colours for registration with the Kennel Club are as follows:
When it comes to tails traditionally Poodles had their tails docked but since the law banning the procedure was passed in 2007 puppies can no longer have their tails docked unless there is a medical reason for doing so which must be authorised by a vet with the correct documentation having been provided by a breeder or owner.
When Toy Poodles move they do so freely with a light happy gait and lots of drive covering a lot of ground for such small dogs.
The Kennel Club frowns on any exaggerations or departures from a Poodles breed standard and would judge the seriousness of a fault on how much it affects a Toy Poodles overall health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform.
Male Toy Poodles should have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums. It is also worth noting that a Toy Poodle can be a little smaller or bigger and they can be slightly heavier or lighter than described in their Kennel Club breed standard which is to be used only as a guide.
Toy Poodles are highly versatile and intelligent little dogs that thrive on human company. They adore being the centre of attention and are quick to learn how to please their owners and families. Providing a Toy Poodle is given lots of attention mental stimulation and daily exercise they are just as happy living in an apartment in town as they are living in a house in the country with a big back garden.
Toy Poodles are high-spirited intelligent little dogs that boast having a happy outlook on life. They thrive in a home environment loving nothing more than to be involved in everything that goes on around them which makes them the ideal companion. They are real clowns and love to entertain and be entertained becoming totally devoted to their owners. They are best suited to households where at least one person stays at home when everyone else is out of the house so they always have company. They are a good choice for first time owners providing they have the time needed to dedicate to their canine companion and their specific grooming needs.
Because they are so smart they are just as quick to pick up bad habits and behaviours which is why a puppy's training must begin as soon as they arrive in their new home by teaching them the "basics" and boundaries. Their training can start in earnest once they've been fully vaccinated. They form extremely strong ties with their owners which although endearing can turn into a bit of a problem if a dog is left on their own for any length of time. Toy Poodles often suffer from separation anxiety if they find themselves alone and if not kept occupied and given enough exercise and things to do they can become neurotic and destructive around the home.
It's very important for these dogs to be well socialised from a young age so they grow up to be confident outgoing mature dogs and not timid and withdrawn. Their socialisation must include introducing them to lots of new situations noises people other animals and dogs once they have been fully vaccinated. It's also crucial for their training to start early too and it must be consistent throughout a dog's life so they understand what is expected of them. A Toy Poodle is never happier than when they know their place in the pack and who they can look to for direction and guidance. If they don't know who is the alpha dog in a household they may quickly take on the role of dominant dog which can make them harder to live with and handle.
Because they are so charming and small it's all too easy to let a Toy Poodle get away with things that larger dogs would never be allowed to do. This can lead to dogs developing a condition known as "Small Dog Syndrome" which can make it challenging to live with them. As such it's best to always treat a Toy Poodle with a firm yet gentle and fair hand making sure they are not allowed to do anything that could lead to them becoming spoilt and unruly.
Although affectionate and loyal to their owners the Toy Poodle can be a little aloof around people they have never met before but rarely would they show any sort of aggression towards strangers preferring to keep their distance and bark until they get to know someone. They are better suited to households where one person stays at home when everyone else is out so they never have to spend too much time on their own.
Toy Poodles are a great choice for first time dog owners because they are so adaptable versatile happy and highly trainable little dogs that just love to please and they thrive on being in a home environment and involved in everything that goes on around them.
Toy Poodles are feisty by nature and will happily chase a smaller animal if they get the chance which is why care should be taken when they are anywhere near livestock or wild animals when out on a walk. Because they have such a tremendous sense of smell if a Toy Poodle picks up an interesting scent they would quite easily take off to investigate what's at the other end turning a deaf ear to any commands they are given.
Toy Poodles are playful by nature and thrive on not only being entertained but on entertaining their owners and families. They adore being at the centre of attention and quickly learn how to please which is just one of the reasons they have consistently remained at the top of the list of most popular dogs throughout the world. Toy Poodles can often be seen competing at high levels in competitions and more especially in agility which they truly excel at.
If not gently curbed when young a Toy Poodle can quickly learn that by barking they get all the attention they thrive on. This can lead to a dog barking incessantly for very little reason. The key to preventing a dog from developing this kind of behaviour is to nip things in the bud firmly yet gently right from the word go. However it’s important not to scare a Toy Poodle into not barking at all or to bark even more in the process. With this said any dog including Toy Poodles when left on their own for longer periods of time could well start barking excessively as a way of showing how unhappy and stressed out they are.
Toy Poodles are real "water dogs" and will happily play in it and go for a swim to cool off which is why care should always be taken when walking a pet anywhere near more dangerous watercourses just in case they decide to leap in. Dogs should not be allowed to go in swimming pools because of the chemicals used to keep a pool clean can be harmful to them and more especially their ultra-sensitive eyes noses and ears.
Toy Poodles may not be big but they are effective watchdogs being quick to let an owner know when something they don't like is going on in their environment and when there are strangers about. However because of their small size anyone wanting a more impressive watchdog would do better to share their homes with a larger dog.
Toy Poodles like their Miniature and Standard cousins are exceptionally intelligent and extremely fast learners. The downside to this is they are just as quick to pick up bad habits as they are the good. They are also extremely sensitive to a person's voice and the way things are said which is one of the reasons why they are so easy to train. As such in the right hands and environment these little dogs are highly trainable and why in times long past they were often seen performing in circuses.
With this said their training must start early and it has to be consistent and always fair throughout a dog’s life so they understand what their owners expect of them. Toy Poodles are never happier than when they are given something to do which is why they are so amenable to learning new things. They excel at many canine sports which includes activities like flyball and agility because they thrive on the attention they are given during their training and the one-to-one contact when competing with their handlers.
The key to successfully training a Toy Poodle is to make their training as interesting as possible and to avoid too much repetition. It's also a good idea to keep training sessions short which helps dogs stay more focussed on what it’s being asked of them bearing in mind that the more intelligent a dog is the faster they get bored and that Toy Poodles are extremely smart little dogs.
As previously mentioned Toy Poodles excel at all sorts of canine sports and more especially agility where they are often seen competing at high levels against other breeds. Because they are so sensitive to a person's voice and the tone used they are ultra-fast at picking up on what they are being asked to do which is why they are so good at many sports. They do not answer well to harsh correction or any sort of heavy handed training methods but they do respond extremely well to positive reinforcement which always brings the best out of these intelligent and quick-witted dogs especially when there are high value rewards involved.
It's very important to set out ground rules and boundaries when sharing a home with a Toy Poodle and the first commands a puppy should be taught as soon as they arrive in their new homes are as follows:
Toy Poodles are normally good around children although due to their small size they are best suited to households where the children are older and who therefore know how to behave around small dogs and more especially know how to handle them and play with them.
When dogs have been well socialised from a young enough age they generally get on well with other dogs they meet and if they have grown up with a family cat in a household they usually get on well together. However a Toy Poodle would think nothing of chasing off any other cats they encounter because they would see them as fair game. They are usually good around other smaller pets in a household especially if they have grown up with them around. However care must be taken when they are around smaller animals they don't already know just to be on the safe side.
The average life expectancy of a Toy Poodle is between 14 and 15 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality diet to suit their ages.
The Toy Poodle is known to suffer from a few hereditary health issues which are worth knowing about if you are planning share your home with one of these small energetic and intelligent dogs although in general they are a healthy breed. The conditions that seem to affect the breed the most include the following:
Poodles are predisposed to suffering from ear infections which is why it is so important to keep their ears free of hair and to keep them as clean as possible. Because Toy Poodles benefit from being professionally groomed every few weeks it's the best time to have hair in a dog's ears carefully and gently removed by an expert.
Fortunately there is a DNA test available for Toy Poodles which all responsible breeders use to ensure their breeding stock is free of Progressive Retinal Atrophy and all potential owners should ask to see that parent dogs have been tested clear before buying a Toy Poodle puppy from them.
Toy Poodle puppies would have had their first vaccinations but it's essential for them to have their follow-up jabs at the right time with the vaccination schedule being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a Toy Poodle should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A male Toy Poodle can safely be neutered when they are 6 months old and females can be spayed when they are 6 months old too.
Some Toy Poodles gain weight after they have been neutered or spayed and it's important to keep a close eye on their calorie intake and the amount of daily exercise they get to prevent obesity. An obese Toy Poodle would be put at risk of developing certain health issues which could end up shortening their lives by several years.
Toy Poodles are prone to developing skin allergies which if left untreated can prove notoriously hard to clear up. With this said allergies can be triggered by several things which includes the following:
All reputable Toy Poodle breeders would have their stud dogs tested for specific conditions to ensure any puppies they breed are less at risk of inheriting certain disorders known to affect the breed. It is also worth noting that when breeders say that parent dogs and puppies have been "vet checked" that it is not the same thing as them having been "health tested".
The scheme available for Toy Poodles is as follows:
The Kennel Club also recommends that all breeders including Assured Breeders have their dogs tested under the following schemes:
Currently there are not extra breed specific breed restrictions in place for Toy Poodles under the Kennel Club rules.
It is mandatory for all Assured Breeders to have their stud dogs tested using the following schemes and the Kennel Club strongly advises other breeders to do the same:
The Kennel Club also recommends that all breeders use the following schemes to test their dogs before using them for breeding purposes:
As with any other breed Toy Poodles need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in top condition bearing in mind that Toy Poodles benefit from having their coats professionally groomed every several weeks or so. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this dogs need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
A Toy Poodle puppy would have been wormed before being sold and the documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are items needed to care for a puppy which should be purchased well in advance of their arrival. The items needed include the following:
All puppies are very sensitive to loud noises so it is important to keep the volume of a television down and not to play music too loudly either because it could frighten a Toy Poodle puppy and prevent them from napping as they should during the day.
Reputable breeders would always ensure their puppies vaccinated before they are sold but as previously mentioned it is up to their new owners to make sure they are given their follow-up shots at the right time which should be as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be
When Toy Poodles reach their golden years they slow down in many ways and they might start showing their age with more grey hairs appearing on their faces and more especially around their muzzles. Apart from a change in their appearance an Toy Poodle's personality might change too and this includes on how quick they are to respond to a command or when their names are called. The reason for this is that many older dog's hearing is not as good as it once was. Other changes to watch out for in a Toy Poodle when they reach their senior years include the following:
Toy Poodles boast having a profuse thick and dense single coat that consists of masses of curls that cover their entire bodies. They shed very little but this does not mean they are easy maintenance because just the opposite is true. Toy Poodles are high maintenance on the grooming front because their coats need to be brushed every day to prevent any tangles and matts from forming. Their coats also need to be professionally clipped every six to eight weeks to keep things tidy and nicely shaped depending on the type of clip they have with the most popular cut being the "Lamb Trim".
Their ears also need to be plucked on a regular basis which is best left up to a professional groomer. Toy Poodles often have tear stains under their eyes which need to be gently wiped with soft damp and clean cloth. It's also important to check a dog's ears on a regular basis and to clean them when necessary. If too much wax builds up it can lead to a painful infection which can be hard to clear up. In short prevention is often easier than cure with ear infections.
They shed very little throughout the year which makes these charming dogs a good choice for people who suffer from pet related allergies although it is also a dog's dander that could trigger an attack.
Having the right grooming tools helps keep aToy Poodle's coat and skin in top condition. The tools needed to keep a dog's coat looking good are as follows:
Toy Poodles may be small in stature but they are energetic intelligent dogs and as such they need to be given the right amount of daily exercise and mental stimulation for them to be truly happy well-rounded dogs. They need anything from 40 to 60-minutes a day with as much off the lead time as possible but only in a safe environment. If they are not given the right amount of mental stimulation and exercise every day a Toy Poodle would quickly get bored and could even begin to show some destructive behaviours around the home which is their way of relieving any stress they are feeling and not necessarily because they are being naughty.
A shorter walk in the morning would be fine but a longer more interesting one in the afternoon is a must with as much off the lead time as possible. These dogs also like to be able to roam around a back garden so they can really let off steam. However the fencing has to be extremely secure to keep these active high-energy little dogs in because if they find a weakness in the fence they will soon escape and could get into all sorts of trouble.
With this said Toy Poodle puppies should not be over exercised because their joints and bones are still growing. This includes not letting a dog jump up and down from furniture or going up or down the stairs. Too much pressure placed on their joints and spines at an early age could result in a dog developing serious problems later in their lives.
If you get a Toy Poodle puppy from a breeder they would give you a feeding schedule and it's important to stick to the same routine feeding the same puppy food to avoid any tummy upsets. You can change a puppy's diet but this needs to be done very gradually always making sure they don't develop any digestive upsets and if they do it's best to put them back on their original diet and to discuss things with the vet before attempting to change it again.
Older dogs are not known to be fussy eaters but this does not mean they can be given a lower quality diet. It's best to feed a mature dog twice a day once in the morning and then again in the evening making sure it's good quality food that meets all their nutritional requirements. It's also important that dogs be given the right amount of exercise so they burn off any excess calories or they might gain too much weight which can lead to all sorts of health issues. Obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years so it's important to keep an eye on their waistline from the word go.
Once a puppy is settled into their new homes it is safe to change their diets but as previously touched upon it needs to be done gradually and carefully to avoid any tummy upsets. As a rough guide Toy Poodle puppies can be fed the following amounts every day to ensure they are getting all the nutrients they need to grow and develop properly:
Once a puppy is 11 months old they can be fed adult dog food.
As a rough guide an adult fully grown Toy Poodle can be fed the following amounts every day to ensure they stay fit and healthy:
If you are looking to buy a Toy Poodle you would need to pay anything from £400 to over £1000 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year-old Toy Poodle in northern England would be £18.43 a month for basic cover but for a lifetime policy this would set you back £39.58 a month (quote as of August 2017). When insurance companies calculate a pet's premium they factor in several things which includes where you live in the UK a dog's age and whether or not they have been neutered or spayed among other things.
When it comes to food costs you need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry making sure it suits the different stages of a dog’s life. This would set you back between £15 - £20 a month. On top of all of this you need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Toy Poodle and this includes their initial vaccinations their annual boosters the cost of neutering or spaying a dog when the time is right and their yearly health checks all of which quickly adds up to over £600 a year.
As a rough guide the average cost to keep and care for a Toy Poodle would be between £35 to £60 a month depending on the level of insurance cover you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred pedigree puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
The Toy Poodle is an extremely popular breed both in the UK and elsewhere in the world which means that well-bred puppies command a lot of money. As such with the Toy Poodle there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:
