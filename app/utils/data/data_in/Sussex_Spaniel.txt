Between 200 and 400 PSI  ‚è∫
The Sussex Spaniel, and many others, have a fearsome presence because they have significant jaw strength, so it is important not to anger the dog and have it around strangers until it is fully trained.
However, they are usually quite calm and good companions, they work well in families and are easy to care for.
In conclusion, while the Sussex Spaniel bite force is certainly an interesting aspect of the breed, it is important not to let it overshadow the many other reasons why these dogs are so loved and respected.

Do Sussex Spaniel dogs need a lot of exercises?
If you notice any weight gain, consult your veterinarian and make a diet plan. Reduce unhealthy food and snacks, and measure the Sussex Spaniel weight regularly.
Brushing the dog's coat is useful to reduce shedding. Ears and eyes should be cleaned regularly to avoid infections.
Don't skip the seasonal flea treatment too. Dog nail trimming and dog bath can be helpful sometimes.
Check the local pet store for dog grooming supplies and find the best dog shampoo to keep its coat healthy and give your dog a pleasant experience of a dog bath.
If you don't have the time, skill, or money to take care of your Sussex Spaniel, search for a dog groomer or clipping service in your area and book an appointment.
Maybe you're lucky to have a dog boarding service that includes grooming or walk-in dog bath places nearby.
If you notice any change in your dog's drooling habit, you should contact a vet as soon as possible.
Medium  ‚è∫
For example, short-haired dog breeds can go a very long time in between baths. These short-haired breeds shed regularly and that shedding works to naturally remove excess dirt and oil. So unless your weenie dog got into the garbage can, you can probably hold off on a bath for a while.

60-64 days
During this time the females start to attract males. You can notice by swelling vulva and bloody discharge.
The second part is the Estrus when the female is receptive for the male. It lasts for about 3 to 11 days.
The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color.
The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the female‚Äôs discharge changes for vivid red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating.
The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts about six months.
Once a year.
The Sussex Spaniel was developed in the English county of Sussex as their name already suggests, at an estate called Rosehill, sometimes between the late 1700s and the mid-1800s. Two men are credited with developing and evolving the Sussex Spaniels into the breed it is today. Their idea was to create a breed whose short legs and burly torso is perfectly suited to hunting feathered game while crawling through the region‚Äôs clay soil, thick hedgerows, and dense underbrush. Because of the fact that the breed was created to be close to the ground, being low, and the cover usually was pretty high, the Sussex Spaniel needed to develop a language of barks and babbling to mark their location to human huntsmen. This distinguishing mark stayed in their DNA, making the Sussex Spaniel be more vocal than other Spaniels. The Sussex though lacks the speed of the Springers and Cockers, but it possesses an extraordinarily good nose which is especially valuable for all forms of uploading shooting. Another unique mark for the breed is the rich golden live color.
One of these two breeders was named Moses Woolland, who obtained his first Sussex Spaniel in 1882, and after that, he went out and successfully bred both the show and field lines too. His dogs did not exactly match the Sussex Spaniels we know today, yet there were many significant similarities. The other breeder was called Campbell Newington, who commenced his breeding processes in 1887. Newington‚Äôs dogs had also shown many similarities to the Sussex Spaniel as it is today. Working together, these two men started breeding dogs whose types and qualities were consistent and homogenous. The standard for the breed was drawn up in the late 19th century. Not much after this, the breed had reached its peak of popularity, yet after Woolland‚Äôs death, Newington was left alone in his efforts to preserve the Sussex Spaniel and form keeping the breed far from being on the brink of extinction. Then, J. E. Kerr got interested in the breed and began producing litters of his own in 1909. It is safe to state that without the efforts of these men, the breed would have fully disappeared by now.
After the First World War, the Sussex Spaniel‚Äôs popularity and numbers decreased even further. In 1921, Newington welcomed his last litter of Sussex Spaniels, and it seemed that the breed might pass into complete extinction, however, fortunately, the breed did not. After the Second World War, the privations and the aggravations posed another challenge for the breed to overcome, because dog breeding was almost ceased in England. Joy Freer is credited with the breed‚Äôs saving, with her efforts, and well-planned breeding program. She spent almost 60 years breeding and perfecting the DNA in her dogs‚Äô lines. The first Sussex Spaniel was imported to the United States shortly before the Great Depression and more followed the following years, prior to World War II. The breed back then was unsuccessful in attracting the general public.
In 1969, three of the breed‚Äôs specimens were imported to the United States, and later eleven more followed them. They are considered to be the basis of the American population of the Sussex Spaniels. Nowadays the breed is still considered to be rare, however, through an understanding of the value of these cheerful spaniels, the breed gained a bit of a respite from the threat of endangerment. Captivatingly, the Sussex Spaniel was among the first nine breeds to be admitted and recognized to the Stud Book when the AKC (American Kennel Club) was formed in 1884.

The Sussex Spaniel isn‚Äôt a dog you see every day, but they are very recognizable when you do. These liver-colored, clownish canines hail from Sussex, England where they accompanied humans on the hunt. Not much has changed over the years. The Sussex still loves the great outdoors, sniffing out critters, and spending time with their crew.
They have been named one of the rarest breeds in present-day England‚Äîand are even rarer in the US. Finding one may not be so easy. But if you‚Äôre wondering if this breed is the right one for you, read on to find out what sets them apart from all the rest.
Sussex Spaniels are a scarce spaniel breed. Depending on where you live, finding a puppy may be a bit of a challenge. But if you find a breeder near you, you should expect to pay a big price. Also, breeders are few and far between. So, there‚Äôs a very good chance you‚Äôre going to have to travel if you want to add one of these floppy-eared puppies to your home.
The good news is, backyard breeding won‚Äôt be a major concern with this breed. So, when you find someone who has Sussex Spaniel pups, they‚Äôre likely to be authentic. In any case, always make sure to check the breeder‚Äôs reputation and parents‚Äô health before committing. You may get lucky and find a Sussex in a local shelter or rescue. Make sure to call around and check online to see what you can find. Most dogs from these places will be surrendered‚Äîand likely adults. But you will pay a fraction of the price with all vetting, spaying or neutering, or other care already in place.
Kippering is when the dog drags their back legs behind them while walking with their front legs. There‚Äôs nothing wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs just one of the Sussex Spaniel‚Äôs quirky behaviors.
In addition to their plumes of wispy hair and elongated bodies, Sussex Spaniels have one coat color that ranges ever-so-slightly in shades of golden liver. Some can be a tad lighter or darker, but these variations are mild at best.
The Sussex Spaniel had a few brush encounters with breed extinction, but none greater than post-World War II. This breed almost disappeared entirely in England. They have never quite regained their once-abundant numbers, remaining an extremely rare breed all over the world.

Sussex Spaniels are considered soft personalities, which means they are very easygoing, but they can be stubborn, too. The earlier you train these dogs, the more receptive they will be of future learning. They truly do have a bleeding heart for their humans, so their want-to-please may outweigh their hard-headedness from time to time.
They love hanging out with their families for cuddles, but if you want to make your Sussex learn new tricks‚Äîthey‚Äôll need a little motivation. Positive reinforcement, usually in the form of a good treat, is the best tactic to train them.¬†A Sussex will never turn down a tasty morsel.
This breed has hunted for generations. It‚Äôs something that is hardwired in their DNA. Because of this, agility and field training comes very naturally to them. They thrive being in nature, even when they aren‚Äôt hunting‚Äîso they make awesome hiking buddies, too.
Sussex Spaniels are devoted and loyal dogs to every member of the household. They love their families so much that they can be a little overly protective of who gets close to them. Known for being slightly aloof, this breed will keenly watch newcomers‚Äîready to intervene at any time if they need to.
Sussex Spaniels adore children, but they may do best with older kids unless they are raised together from puppyhood. They are pretty relaxed, so the chaos that little ones can bring may overwhelm them a bit. Each dog is different, so your Sussex may take to tiny tots better than some others. Always supervise playtime, in any regard.
This breed is also the most vocal of all the other spaniel variations. So, if you live near others, like in an apartment or condo, your neighbors may not take kindly to the excessive barking.¬†Enforcing healthy barking behavior may work, but remember that this is simply ingrained in the breed.
The earlier you can expose your Sussex to other animals‚Äîthe better. They can make superb companions for other dogs and even cats. But socializing your puppy is the best way to ensure they will thrive with other pets.
Sussex Spaniels can be territorial with unfamiliar canines. While this isn‚Äôt necessarily common spaniel behavior, this breed is the most likely to act out in aggression if they think another pooch is intruding on their hearth and home.
Also, because of their prey drive, you shouldn‚Äôt trust them alone with smaller pets‚Äîlike birds or rodents. Instinctually, they may act without understanding that the animal is a friend, not food.¬†For the same reason, you should always have your Sussex in a secured yard or on a leash‚Äîespecially if you live in the city or suburbs. They can get distracted easily by the neighborhood critters and wander away before you realize.¬†However, in rural areas, you can likely trust this dog to roam at their own leisure.

Sussex Spaniels have robust appetites and will eat pretty much anytime you allow them to do so. Because of their voracious eating habits, they need a controlled diet full of antioxidants, protein, and fatty acids.
Each dog will be different in structure, weight, and activity level. These dogs do best with a high-quality dry kibble diet to meet their dietary needs. Generally speaking, a full-grown Sussex will need roughly 2 cups of dry kibble per day‚Äîthough you should always follow the feeding chart on the back of the bag.
Offer wet food as a topper if you wish, but remember these dogs are prone to weight gain. So, moderation is key for any damp dish.
For snacking, offer low-calorie snacks like wholesome fruits, veggies, and grains.
Sussex Spaniels need a moderate to low amount of exercise per day. Sometimes, they need a little motivation to get moving‚Äîthese dogs like naps, snacks, and relaxing. So, getting them out of the house lets them burn off a little energy and keep a healthy weight.
Since these dogs love the great outdoors, you won‚Äôt have to coax them out while they put up a fight. Sussex Spaniels love a good adventure, happily accompanying you on walks, hikes, and explorations. They‚Äôre also terrific swimmers who will want to splash in the water any chance they get.
In total, Sussex Spaniels require about 20 to 30 minutes of activity per day.
Sussex Spaniels are very smart, so they can pick up on training easily‚Äîif they‚Äôre in the mood. These dogs can be quite picky about where and when they want to learn, and just how much they‚Äôll retain.
They do not respond to harsh punishments or mistreatment‚Äînor will they forget it. They have exceptional memories, so make sure you‚Äôre giving them good ones. The Sussex does best with repetitive, consistent training and reward.
Beginning training in the very early puppy days reaps the best results. These dogs are hunters, so getting them ready for those types of commands around six months of age helps to best shape their abilities.
Because of their bodies developing, agility training should happen after the bulk of their growing finishes. These dogs are slow to grow, and it can hurt more than help to engage in these actions too early.
Sussex Spaniels are short-legged, long-bodied dogs with liver-colored fur. They‚Äôre moderate shredders who benefit from regular brushing.¬†But they don‚Äôt require haircuts or extensive coat care, so things should go smoothly in the grooming department.
Coats of neutered males change to a fuzzy, cotton-like texture, which can make combing a challenge. To prevent matting and knots, brush up to three times a week‚Äîor as needed.
Trimming the legs can be helpful so they can maintain traction under their feet. Sometimes the frills of hair on their legs can grow too long and get in the way. There is no need to shave the fur of a Sussex Spaniel. When you do, the coat grows back very slowly‚Äîso it‚Äôs best to avoid that altogether.
Sussex Spaniels are generally healthy dogs with no major genetic concerns. However, there are certain problems found in the breed more frequently than others. Regular veterinary checkups allow you to get ahead of any potential issues, tackling them as they come.

Both male and female Sussex Spaniels are wonderful companion animals with a vibrant personality. This laidback dog is gentle, happy, and loving‚Äîregardless of being male or female.¬†However, there will be minor differences between the male and female Sussex Spaniels that are noteworthy.
Males tend to be slightly larger than females. They also have a higher inclination to bark if they hear a noise or see a passerby‚Äîalthough both genders are highly vocal.
Females are smaller than males. They tend to be a bit more difficult to house train, picking up the concept slightly slower than their male counterparts. Females may also have whelping trouble, so if you plan to breed, know there could be higher vet costs associated with pregnancy care.
Of course, none of these factors should be deal-breakers. Always meet the puppies to access your connection. An individual personality is more important than gender.
Summing up, if you want a laid back dog who‚Äôs also protective‚Äîthe Sussex Spaniel may be a perfect fit. Keep in mind these dogs are very vocal and will bark whenever they feel they need to. Aside from their own loud howls, they like a slow-paced life free of commotion. So, if you‚Äôre the type to take a relaxed approach to life, they will surely follow suit.
Does the Sussex sound like a soulmate? If they do, consider checking local shelters to give a pup a second chance before opting for a puppy.

Although not as popular as other spaniel breeds they are highly rated as working gundogs in the field and are very popular in the showring. With this said the Sussex is known to be a kind natured dog and one that makes a great family pet being just as happy in a home environment as there are working in the field. However anyone wanting to share a home with a Sussex Spaniel would need to register their interest with breeders for the pleasure of doing so.
Sussex Spaniels are one of the oldest native breeds in the UK having been around since the early 1800's. One of the breed's main enthusiasts was a landowner by the name of Mr. Augustus Elliott Fuller who kept Sussex Spaniels and others at his kennels on his large estate that was situated in the county of Sussex. He bred spaniels over a time span of 50 years as working dogs with great success.
Although there were other Sussex Spaniels around at the time breed numbers dropped by the end of World War II and by 1945 there were only 7 known to be in existence. Fortunately thanks to the efforts and hard work of breed enthusiasts including one lady in particular by the name of Mrs. Freer the Sussex Spaniel was saved from extinction and the Sussex Spaniel Association was later formed in 1924. Slowly through careful and selective breeding Sussex Spaniel numbers started to rise over the ensuing decades albeit it slowly.
Today their numbers remain quite low with only around 60 to 100 pedigree puppies being bred and registered with The Kennel Club every year. As such these charming spaniels have been placed on the UK's native vulnerable breed list and were only recognised as a unique breed in the own right by The Kennel Club in 2004 although as previously mentioned these charming spaniels have been placed on the KC‚Äôs list of native vulnerable breeds.
Height at the withers: Males 38 - 41 cm Females 38 - 41 cm
Average weight: Males 16 - 20 kg Females 16 - 20 kg
Their brows are furrowed giving the impression that a Sussex Spaniel is always frowning and they have well developed nostrils with nice liver coloured noses. Their eyes are a nice hazel colour being quite large and having a gentle expression in them. Ears are quite large and lobular being set moderately low on a dog's head lying close to their faces. The Sussex Spaniel has a strong jaw with a perfect scissor bite where their upper teeth neatly overlap their lower ones.
Their necks are strong long with a hint of an arch and dogs have a nice frill around their necks. They have sloping shoulders and strong powerful well-muscled short front legs showing a good amount of bone. Chests are well developed and deep with dogs having nicely developed and muscular backs and loins having a good depth and width to them. Their back ribs are deep adding to the powerful appearance of the Sussex Spaniel's body. Back legs are strong powerful and well boned.
Their feet are well padded and round in shape with a good amount of feathering in between their toes. Tails are set low and are moderately long which dogs carry level to their backs but never above. Their tails are thickest at the root but taper to the tip and are nicely feathered. When excited or alert a Sussex Spaniels wags their tail in a very lively manner which is one of their endearing traits.
When it comes to their coat the Sussex Spaniel has a profuse flat top coat with a good amount of softer denser undercoat. Their ears are covered with wavy and much softer hair with their forequarters as well as their hindquarters being moderately feathered too. The only accepted breed colour for Kennel Club registration is as follows:
It is worth noting that the accepted breed colours for Kennel Club registration can differ from those set out in the breed standard which are as follows:
Under the Kennel Club breed standard dark liver or puce colour coats are highly undesirable
When a Sussex Spaniel moves they do so with a distinct roll both in their forequarters and hindquarters.
The Kennel Club frowns on any exaggerations or departures from the breed standard and would judge the faults on how much they affect a dog's overall health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform.
Males should have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums and it is worth noting that a dog can be a little lighter or heavier as well as slightly taller or shorter than set out in the Kennel Club breed standard which is only given as a guideline.
Unlike other gundogs the Sussex Spaniel likes to let an owner know when they have found something or when they are excited about anything. As such they are known to bark which is something deeply embedded in their working psyche. They have a very calm and kind disposition and like to do things at their own slower pace which is another unusual trait for a spaniel. They love being part of a family and are just as happy in a home environment as they are working in the field which is one of the reasons why they make such wonderful family pets and companions.
They are intelligent dogs and as such they need to be given the right amount of mental stimulation or boredom would quickly set in which could lead to a dog developing some unwanted behavioural issues. Sussex Spaniels thrive on having people around them and are never happy when left on their own for any great length of time. As such they are a great choice for people who live in the country and in a household where at least one person usually stays at home when everyone else is out.
With this said they are a great choice for first time owners thanks to their kind placid laid-back natures and the fact they are always willing and eager to please. But these spaniels are high maintenance on the exercise front and need to be given lots of "off the lead" time to be truly happy well-rounded characters.
It's important for Sussex Spaniel puppies to be well socialised from a young enough age so they grow up to be more confident mature dogs. Their socialisation has to include introducing them to lots of new people situations noises other animals and dogs once they have been fully vaccinated. Their training also has to begin when they are still young in order to gently curb their rather strong hunting instinct. They can be a little wilful at times but with patience and understanding this can easily be overcome.
In the right environment and with the correct amount of early socialisation and training a Sussex Spaniel is a real pleasure to have around and they are more than happy to curl up on a sofa at the end of the day with their owners. Because they boast such kind natures Sussex Spaniels are often seen working as PAT therapy dogs in schools hospices and hospitals.
Sussex Spaniels are a good choice for first time dog owners because they are so amenable and people-oriented loving nothing more than to please and to entertain their families. When they grow up with children in the home they get on well together. However as with other breeds care should be taken when puppies and dogs are around very young children just to be on the safe side.
Although social by nature Sussex Spaniels were bred to hunt and therefore they have a high prey drive and will happily chase any animals that try to run away or that they spot in the distance. As such care should be taken as to where and when a dog can run off the lead more especially if there is wildlife or livestock around. The good news is that a well -trained Sussex would obey a recall command and would stay at heel when asked to.
Sussex Spaniels have a very playful side to their natures and love to entertain and be entertained quickly learning how to please an owner and how to get their own way. They do well at obedience and enjoy the one to one attention they are given when being trained or taking part in competitions.
Although Sussex Spaniels are highly adaptable dogs being just as happy working in the field as they are in a home environment they are better suited to households with large secure back gardens a dog can safely roam in whenever possible to really let off steam.
Sussex Spaniels form strong ties with their families and dogs are never very happy when they find themselves left on their own for longer periods of time. However they are not known to suffer from separation anxiety providing they are not left for too long which could see any dog develop some unwanted and destructive behaviours around the home as a way of relieving the stress they are feeling.
Some Sussex Spaniels like the sound of their own voices a little too much which is something that needs to be gently nipped in the bud when a dog is still young being careful not to frighten them. Others will only bark when there are strangers about or when something they don't like is going on in their surroundings. With this said they have a distinct voice and will happily ‚Äúbay‚Äù or howl when left to their own devices for extended periods of time.
Most Sussex Spaniels love swimming and will take to the water whenever they can more especially when the weather is hot. However if anyone who owns a dog that does not like water should never force them to go in because it would just end up scaring them. With this said care should always be taken when walking a Sussex off the lead anywhere near more dangerous watercourses just in case a dog decides to leap in and then needs rescuing because they cannot get out of the water on their own. It is also important to thoroughly dry off a dog‚Äôs ears to prevent any ear infections from flaring up.
Unlike many other spaniels the Sussex is a good watchdog because they are by nature suspicious around strangers and people they don‚Äôt already know bearing in mind they are also very protective of their families and property.
The Sussex Spaniel is known to be a happy cheerful dog but they do have their own special ways about them. This includes doing things at their own pace. As such they are not as fast when it comes to learning new things but with patience and understanding these charming dogs can be taught to behave nicely and to be obedient. It might just take a little longer for the penny to drop than it does with other spaniel breeds.
Like many other dogs the Sussex Spaniel is sensitive by nature and in particular to "voice" commands. As such it would be a mistake to use a raised voice to correct them. This would not achieve positive results and may even end up making a Sussex Spaniel a little on the timid side. They do respond extremely well to positive reinforcement which always brings out the best in these dogs. However it's best to give fewer high value rewards than to give a Sussex Spaniel lots of lower value ones because they are prone to putting on too much weight far too easily which could end up shortening their lives considerably.
Like all puppies Sussex Spaniels are incredibly cute when young and it is all too easy to spoil them when they first arrive in new homes. As soon as a puppy is nicely settled owners must start out as they mean to go on by laying down ground rules and boundaries so that a puppy understands what is expected of them. It helps establish a pecking order and who the alpha dog is in the household. The first commands a puppy should be taught are as follows:
The Sussex Spaniel is a laid-back character and one that enjoys being part of a family and involved in everything that goes on around them. They are known to be particular good around children especially if they have grown up together. However any interaction between younger children or toddlers and a dog should always be supervised by an adult to make sure playtime does not end up getting too boisterous especially when dogs are still going through their puppy stage.
If well socialised from a young enough age they do get on with other dogs although they can be a little "off" with dogs they don't already know. When a Sussex Spaniel grows up with a family cat in a household they usually get on well together but they would not think twice about chasing off any cats they don't know. Care has to be taken when they are around small animals and pets because their prey drive might just get the better of them.
The average life expectancy of a Sussex Spaniel is between 14 and 16 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality diet to suit their ages.
The Sussex Spaniel is known to suffer from a few hereditary health issues which are worth knowing about if you are planning share your home with one of these active and good-looking dogs but on the whole they are a healthy robust breed. The conditions that seem to affect the breed the most include the following:
It is worth noting that the Kennel Club breed average COI for the Sussex Spaniel currently stands at 20.3%.
Sussex Spaniel puppies would have been given their initial vaccinations before being sold but it is up to their new owners to make sure they have their follow-up shots in a timely manner with the vaccination schedule for puppies being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a dog should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A lot of vets these days recommend waiting until dogs are slightly older before spaying and neutering them which means they are more mature before undergoing the procedures. As such they advise neutering males and spaying females when they are between the ages of 6 to 9 months old and sometimes even when a dog is 12 months old.
Other vets recommend spaying and neutering dogs when they are 6 months old but never any earlier unless for medical reasons. With this said many breeds are different and it is always advisable to discuss things with a vet and then follow their advice on when a dog should be spayed or neutered.
As with other breeds some Sussex Spaniels gain weight after they have been spayed or neutered and it's important to keep an eye on a dog's waistline just in case they do. If a dog starts to put on weight it's important to adjust their daily calorie intake and to up the amount of exercise they are given. Older dogs too are more prone to gaining weight and again it's essential they be fed and exercised accordingly because obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years. The reason being that it puts a lot of extra strain on a dog's internal organs including the heart which could prove fatal.
Sussex Spaniels are known to suffer from skin problems and allergies which means it's important for a dog to see a vet sooner rather than later if a problem flares up. Allergies can be notoriously hard to clear up and finding the triggers can be challenging. With this said a vet would be able to make a dog with an allergy more comfortable while they try to find out the triggers which could include the following:
All responsible Sussex Spaniel breeders would ensure that their stud dogs are tested for known hereditary and congenital health issues known to affect the breed by using the following schemes:
Apart from the standard breeding restrictions that are in place for all Kennel Club registered breeds there are no other breed specific breeding restrictions in place for the Sussex Spaniel.
The Kennel Club strongly recommends that all breeders use the following scheme on dogs:
As with any other breed Sussex Spaniels need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in top condition. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this dogs need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
It's best to pick a puppy up when people are going to be around for the first week or so which is the time needed for a puppy to settle in. Puppy-proofing the home and garden means putting away any tools and other implements that a boisterous puppy might injure themselves on. Electric wires and cables must be put out of their reach because puppies love chewing on things. Toxic plants should be removed from flowerbeds and the home too.
Puppies need to sleep a lot to grow and develop as they should which means setting up a quiet area that's not too out of the way means they can retreat to it when they want to nap and it's important not to disturb them when they are sleeping. It's also a good idea to keep "playtime" nice and calm inside the house and to have a more active "playtime" outside in the garden which means puppies quickly learn to be less boisterous when they are inside.
The documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are certain items that new owners need to already have in the home prior to bringing a new puppy home. It's often a good idea to restrict how much space a puppy plays in more especially when you can't keep an eye on what they get up to bearing in mind that puppies are often quite boisterous which means investing in puppy gates or a large enough playpen that allows a puppy the room to express themselves while keeping them safe too. The items needed are therefore as follows:
All puppies are sensitive to noise including Sussex Spaniel puppies. It's important to keep the noise levels down when a new puppy arrives in the home. TVs and music should not be played too loud which could end up stressing a small puppy out making them withdrawn timid and shy.
As previously mentioned Sussex Spaniel puppies would have been given their first vaccinations by the breeders but they must have their follow up shots which is up to their new owners to organise. The vaccination schedule for puppies is as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be fully up to date.
Older Sussex need lots of special care because as they reach their golden years they are more at risk of developing certain health concerns. Physically a dog's muzzle may start to go grey but there will be other noticeable changes too which includes the following:
Living with a Sussex Spaniel in their golden years means taking on a few more responsibilities but these are easily managed and should include looking at their diet the amount of exercise they are given how often their dog beds need changing and keeping an eye on the condition of their teeth.
Older Sussex need to be fed a good quality diet that meets their needs at this stage of their lives all the while keeping a close eye on a dog's weight. A rough feeding guide for older dogs is as follows bearing in mind they should be fed highly digestible food that does not contain any additives:
Older Sussex Spaniels don't need the same amount of daily exercise as a younger dog but they still need the right amount of physical activity to maintain muscle tone and to prevent a dog from putting on too much weight. All dogs need access to fresh clean water and this is especially true of older dogs when they reach their golden years because they are more at risk of developing kidney disorders.
The Sussex Spaniel has a medium length top coat and a denser softer undercoat which makes them high maintenance in the grooming department more especially during the Spring and then again in the Autumn when they tend to shed the most. Ideally their coats need to be brushed every day paying special attention to feathers found on a dog's legs chest ears abdomen and tail. Daily brushing helps prevent any knots or tangles from forming and to remove any debris a dog might have picked up.
It's also important to check a dog's ears on a regular basis and to clean them when necessary. If too much wax is allowed to build up in a dog's ears it can lead to a painful infection which can be hard to clear up. In short prevention is often easier than cure when it comes to ear infections bearing in mind that Sussex Spaniels are prone to ear problems.
Sussex Spaniels are intelligent energetic albeit laid-back dogs and they need to be given the right amount of daily exercise paired to as much mental stimulation as possible for them to be truly happy well-balanced dogs. They are most suited to life in the country and with people who lead more active outdoor lives. They need to be given at least 2 hour's exercise a day which should include as much off the lead time as possible.
A shorter walk in the morning would be fine but a longer more interesting one in the afternoon is a must. These dogs also like to be able to roam around a back garden as often as possible so they can really let off steam. However the fencing has to be extremely secure to keep these high energy dogs in because if they find a weakness in the fence they will soon escape out and get into all sorts of trouble.
With this said Sussex Spaniel puppies should not be over exercised because their joints and bones are still developing. This includes not letting a dog jump up and down from furniture or going up or down the stairs. Too much pressure placed on their joints and spines at an early age could result in a dog developing serious problems later in their lives.
If you get a Sussex Spaniel puppy from a breeder they would give you a feeding schedule and it's important to stick to the same routine feeding the same puppy food to avoid any tummy upsets. You can change a puppy's diet but this needs to be done very gradually always making sure they don't develop any digestive upsets and if they do it's best to put them back on their original diet and to discuss things with the vet before attempting to change it again. It's worth bearing in mind that some puppies can be a little fussy about their food and if this is the case the best course of action is to discuss things with a vet or dog nutritionist who would be able to offer the best and most reliable advice.
Older dogs are not known to be fussy or finicky eaters but this does not mean you can feed them a lower quality diet. It's best to feed a mature dog twice a day once in the morning and then again in the evening making sure it's good quality food that meets all their nutritional requirements. It's also important that dogs be given the right amount of exercise so they burn off any excess calories or they might gain too much weight which can lead to all sorts of health issues. Obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years so it's important to keep an eye on their waistline from the word go.
Puppies need to be fed a highly nutritious good quality diet for them to develop and grow as they should. As a rough guide a Sussex Spaniel puppy can be fed the following amounts every day making sure their meals are evenly spread out throughout the day and it's best to feed them 3 or 4 times a day:
Once a puppy is 12 months old they can be fed adult dog food.
Once fully mature an adult Sussex Spaniel be fed a good quality diet to ensure their continued good health. As a rough guide an adult dog can be fed the following amounts every day:
If you are looking to buy a Sussex Spaniel you would need to register your interest with breeders and be put on a waiting list because very few pedigree puppies are bred and registered with The Kennel Club every year. You would also need to pay anything from ¬£500 to over ¬£600 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year-old Sussex Spaniel in northern England would be ¬£24.19 a month for basic cover but for a lifetime policy this would set you back ¬£45.42 a month (quote as of October2018). When insurance companies calculate a pet's premium they factor in several things which includes where you live in the UK a dog's age and whether they have been neutered or spayed among other things.
When it comes to food costs you need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry making sure it suits the different stages of a dog‚Äôs life. This would set you back between ¬£30 - ¬£40 a month. On top of all of this you need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Sussex Spaniel and this includes their initial vaccinations their annual boosters the cost of neutering or spaying a dog when the time is right and their yearly health checks all of which quickly adds up to over ¬£1000 a year.
As a rough guide the average cost to keep and care for a Sussex Spaniel would be between ¬£60 to ¬£90 a month depending on the level of insurance cover you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred Kennel Club registered pedigree Sussex Spaniel puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
Finding Sussex Spaniel puppies can prove challenging with few dogs being registered with the Kennel Club every year which means that well-bred puppies can often command a lot of money. As such with Sussex Spaniels there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:
