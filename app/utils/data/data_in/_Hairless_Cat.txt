Hairless cats are unique, interesting, and fiercely lovable. Many people mistakenly think that hairless cats are a breed of their own, but there are several distinct breeds of hairless cats recognized by breed registries like the Cat Fanciers’ Association and The International Cat Association. There are also quite a few designer breeds and experimental crosses that result in hairless cats.
Each breed of hairless cat has certain qualities that make them just a bit different from the rest, whether that be muscle tone, facial structure, or coat.
We’ve made a list of six of the most popular hairless cat breeds to help you tell the difference.

If your heart is set on a hairless cat, please note that there are a few pointers that you would want to consider prior to adopting one such cat.
When most people think of hairless cats, they envision a Sphynx, and rightly so, since these are the most common of the hairless cat breeds. Their lean physique, large ears, and wrinkled faces give them a unique look, even among other hairless breeds. Rather than being entirely hairless, their coat is velvety and feels almost like peach fuzz. A Sphynx may even have tufts of fur, especially on their face, legs, or tail.
In terms of personality, Sphynx owners will tell you that their cats are not quite like other cats. They’re both vocal and social, so they tend to follow their human friends around while chattering away. Sphynxes are described as bright and curious.
The Elf is a relatively new breed produced by crossing an American Curl and a Sphynx, taking the most appealing features of both. The breed is currently considered experimental. Like a Sphynx, they aren’t completely hairless; their coat is downy and soft to the touch. Their American Curl lineage shows in their ears, which curl backward in an arc up to 180 degrees. Elf cats have prominent facial features with pronounced cheekbones.
This hairless hybrid can be a bit of a handful, much like a Sphynx. Anecdotally, as kittens, they tend to be restless and frisky. As adults, an Elf may calm down and become an affectionate lap cat but will probably retain their love of climbing and perching at great heights.
Peterbalds are known to have sweet temperaments and acclimate well to homes with other pets or children. Their webbed feet and oval paws give them dexterity that when combined with their clever nature, can get into trouble around the house. Nosy Peterbald cats can open cabinets and grasp objects far more easily than most other cats.
The Donskoy cat is another relatively new Russian breed that’s known by a few different names. Sometimes called a Don Sphynx or Russian Hairless, the Donskoy is a bit unusual as hairless cats go. While other cats get their baldness from a recessive gene, this breed owes their coat — or lack thereof — to a dominant gene mutation. Despite their name and hairless appearance, they’re not related to Sphynx cats.
Some Donskoys grow a patchy coat during the winter months, shedding it each year when the weather turns cold. Donskoys require a fair bit of grooming for a hairless cat. They are prone to skin issues and can smell somewhat off-putting if they aren’t bathed regularly.
The Lykoi — commonly called a werewolf cat — isn’t always a hairless cat, but they’re unusual enough to be worth mentioning. Some of these cats have a full coat of fur, while others are entirely hairless. Others grow a coat during some seasons and then shed it. Most Lykoi cats lack fur on their faces, legs, and feet.
Although they may look like a Sphynx, genetic testing has been done on this breed to confirm they are not descended from Sphynxes. Their werewolf-like appearance is caused by a naturally occurring mutation in shorthaired cats.
The Minskin is the result of crossing a Munchkin and a Sphynx, with other breeds like Devon Rex included. This cross results in a tiny hairless cat with very short legs and unusually large ears. These cats are much smaller than average, topping out at around 6 pounds (north of 2 kg). Minskins are not entirely hairless; their faces, ears, legs, and tail are usually covered in a fine, velvety fur.
Minskins are distinct from other hairless cats in that they are generally fairly round. With round eyes, round cheeks, and a medium-sized body, they are much less angular and bony than most other breeds descended from the Sphynx.

Hairless cats are often said to be an “acquired taste”. However, rest assured that no matter which of these hairless cat breeds you’re considering, you’ll find an intelligent, inquisitive, playful animal. They make wonderful companion animals and want to be an important part of their households. What hairless cats lack in fluffiness, they make up for in the warmth of personality.

Hairless cats make interesting pets. While they might not be cute in the traditional sense, it does not make them any less beautiful. Additionally, hairless cats are more likely to form deeper bonds with their owners than regular cats. Due to their lack of fur, they need to snuggle up next to you to keep warm.
Some people consider adopting hairless cats, thinking they are hypoallergenic. However, being hairless does not make a cat allergy-friendly. This is because allergens are found in the cat’s dead skin cells, not in its hair. Nevertheless, since hairless cats require frequent bathing, they are less likely to trigger allergies as baths allow you to eliminate the allergy-causing dander.
Apart from a lack of hair, hairless breeds are ordinary cats, meaning they behave like any other felines. Interested in picking up one? The following is a list of recognized hairless cat breeds.

The Sphynx is arguably the most popular hairless cat breed on the planet. Unlike several other hairless breeds, the Sphynx’s hairlessness results from a natural mutation, not human manipulation. This kitty has a suede-textured coat with little thin fuzz on its head, feet, and tail. They have wrinkled skin around the head and shoulders. As with any other cat, the Sphynx also comes in various colors and patterns.
Sphynxes are charming cats. They are affectionate, loyal, curious, and playful. Additionally, they get along with other pets, which is why they make great pets.
Despite all its charm, this cat requires regular cleaning to remove oil and debris that accumulate under their skin folds.
The Bambino is a cross between a Sphynx and the adorable Munchkin cat. It has its parents’ trademark attributes: the Sphynx’s hairlessness and the Munchkin’s short stature and tiny legs. Some people call this cutie “baby cat” due to how adorable it is. Nevertheless, despite its small size and short legs, the Bambino does not have mobility issues.
Like the Sphynx, the Bambino also comes in numerous shades, colors, and patterns. Bambinos are intelligent, affectionate to their owners, and friendly to other pets and strangers. These cats are also big fans of cuddles.
The Minskin is also a cross between a Sphynx and a Munchkin, which is why it is often difficult to tell Minskins and Bambinos apart. However, Minksins tend to be smaller than Bambinos and have some fur on their extremities. They have a thinly dispersed coat with a velvety texture around their face and legs. They also come in all colors, shades, and patterns. The Minskin is intelligent, playful, and has a propensity for goofiness. As you can imagine, they are more than adorable.
Fun fact: The name “Minskin” is derived from the words “miniature” and “skin.”
The Donskoy—also known as Don Sphynx or Don Hairless—is a Russian hairless cat breed. This breed came about when its founder rescued a kitten that started losing fur at only 4 months of age. As such, Donskoy’s hairlessness is not a result of human manipulation but a genetic mutation.
Since genetics determine whether a Donskoy cat will be hairless, not all Donskoys are hairless. Some have patches of hair all over their bodies. Interestingly, all Donskoys can grow a winter coat, making them unique among hairless cat breeds.
The Donskoy is muscular, heavy-boned, and athletic. They come in various colors and patterns. It is also intelligent, friendly, and playful, making it a great fit for most homes.
The Peterbald is among the most expensive, as well as rarest cat breeds in the world. This hairless feline is a cross between a Donskoy and an Oriental Shorthair. However, the degree of hairlessness tends to vary among Peterbald cats. Some are entirely hairless, others have a fine down, while a few sport a suede-like coat. Moreover, infants are born with hair, shedding it as they mature.
The Peterbald has thick and dense wrinkles all over its body. This cat is remarkably athletic, thanks to its muscular composition.
The Ukrainian Levkoy is a cross between the Donskoy and the Scottish Fold. It inherits the Donskoy’s hairlessness and the Scottish Fold’s inward-folding ears. Most people describe its face as being dog-like. The Ukrainian displays sexual dimorphism, meaning that the males are significantly larger than the females. But whether male or female, they make great pets.
Unfortunately, the International Cat Association (TICA) and the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA) have yet to recognize this breed. Therefore, it is difficult to find in the USA.
This tiny, hairless cutie originates from the United States. The name “Dwelf” is derived from the words “dwarf” and “elf,” as a homage to its short stature and large, curled ears.
The Dwelf was developed by crossing various breeds, including the Sphynx, Munchkin, and the American Curl. This cat is playful and said to have a dog-like personality.

Most people assume hairless breeds require less maintenance since one does not have to keep grooming them. However, hairless cats need regular sponge baths to stay healthy. This is because the lack of hair promotes the buildup of oil and debris on their skin, which can trigger skin problems.
Additionally, hairless cats are susceptible to temperature extremes. Too much time in the sun can result in sunburns, while below-average temperatures are highly uncomfortable for the cat for obvious reasons.
Therefore, do your research first before adopting one of these hairless cuties.

Cats come in all shapes and sizes, and some of the most impressive cat breeds are - hairless. Most cat lovers heard about the amazing Sphynx breed. Still, other hairless cat breeds might be ideal for cat lovers that have the misfortune of being allergic to cats. If you’re anything like us, you will absolutely love these amazing hairless cats. Here are 7 amazing hairless cat breeds.
Let’s get the most famous hairless cat breed out of the way first - the Sphynx. This cat breed is arguably the most famous hairless cat breed. Their appearance has an aura of mystique and elegance. Sphynx cats look like they might be ancient Egyptian pharaohs’ favorite pets. However, the breed is not actually that old.

The Sphynx’s hairless appearance is a result of a natural genetic mutation. Cat breeders loved the mutated trait, so they carefully bred them to solidify the trait and create a unique breed. These cats are usually friendly, curious, outgoing, and playful. They are ideal pets for cat allergy sufferers.
Sphynx and Don Sphynx are not the same cat breed despite their similar names. Don Sphynx is a Russian cat breed, and it is also called Russian Hairless and Donskoy. The Don Sphynx is a relatively young breed, and its history started in 1987. A cat breeder named Elena Kovaleva bred the first specimens of Don Sphynx.

This breed has many interesting character traits, and our favorite one is - loyalty. These cats have been described as one of the most loyal cat breeds, and some even compare them to dogs. They are active, playful, and love being handled by their owners. They make ideal companions.
Hairless cats already stand out in the feline kingdom, but the Peterbald breed does it even more. Their hairless trait is unique because these cats actually have a hair-losing gene. Peterbald kittens can be born with a full set of fur, which will fall out as the cat ages. This is another Russian cat breed with a relatively short history.

The Peterbald breed is absolutely amazing. These cats are related to the Oriental Shorthairs, so they share many temperament traits. This hairless beauty is very intelligent, friendly, and active. They will make fantastic pets for all those that absolutely love bald cat breeds.
The Ukrainian Levkoy is not an internationally recognized cat breed. It is a passion project of a Ukrainian cat breeder that decided to cross the Don Sphynx with the Scottish Fold. The result is an interesting hairless cat with folded ears. It is a relatively new cat breed that has been around since the early 2000s’.

The Ukrainian Levkoy is a combination of the two parent breeds. These cats are relatively intelligent, playful, curious, and affectionate towards their owners. They are known in Ukraine to be great additions to households with multiple pets because they get along with everyone.
If you’re looking for a cat companion that has a fantastic story behind it, you should look no further than the amazing werewolf cat. The actual name of the breed is Lykoi, and these cats can be hairless or have fur. If they have fur, it will be black and gray, giving the cat a unique werewolf appearance, which is how they got their nickname.

This breed might look mean, but they are actually pretty sweet. Lykoi cats are intelligent, affectionate, and playful. They make fantastic pets for cat lovers. They are currently the youngest pureblooded cat breed because their history started in 2010. They were accepted in the Championship Class in 2017.
The Minskin is one of the latest mixed breeds that resulted in a hairless cat. These cats are a mix between the Munchkin and Sphynx. Cat breeders developed a breeding plan later and introduced the Devon Rex and the Burmese cats in the mix.

This is another hairless breed that is not fully internationally accepted. In fact, like many other hairless cat breeds, it can be born with fine fur all over the body. More precisely, on most of its body, the belly should always be hairless. Like most other cats, they make fantastic pets to all of us that love cats.
The Elf is a hairless cat breed created by mixing a Sphynx with the American Curl. It was inspired by the character of “Dobby,” a house-elf from the Harry Potter books. The interesting cross has not been with us for long. It is a relatively new cat breed that is a part of the crossbreeding trend currently popular in the feline and canine kingdoms.

The Elf is a fantastic pet, which is not that surprising. However, most crossbreeds still have many questions to answer. The most important ones are about their health. Vets and researchers simply don’t know that much about them, the diseases they are prone to, or their average lifespan. Nevertheless, this hairless cat with curled ears promises to be a pretty fantastic addition to the feline kingdom.
