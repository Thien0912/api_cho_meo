Afghan hounds are an ancient sight-hound breed originally used for hunting leopards and gazelles in the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. Despite its glamorous, regal appearance, the Afghan hound’s long, silky coat serves as a protective barrier against Afghanistan’s harsh climate. Often described as “catlike” by breed aficionados, Afghan hounds are aloof and dignified in the company of strangers, but they’re fiercely loyal and affectionate with members of their human family. But are Afghan hounds cat-friendly dogs? Let’s find out.
Because Afghan hounds have tracking and hunting hardwired in their genetic makeup, they’re rarely found on any “best dogs for cats” lists. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t train an Afghan hound to be cat-friendly. Afghan hounds have a reputation for being stubborn, so we wouldn’t recommend one of these sight hounds to a first-time dog owner. If you have more experience training dogs — and the patience and time to do so — Afghan hounds can be taught to live in harmony with their feline family members. We’ll teach you how to do it in just six steps.
Whether you already have an Afghan hound and have just adopted a cat, or you’re bringing an Afghan hound into your cat-occupied home, you’ll want to keep them separated for the first few days. Make sure your dog can’t reach your cat, and don’t leave them alone together for any reason at first. With their keen olfactory senses, your fur babies will learn to recognize each other by scent even without being in the same room.
Give them time to adjust to having a new scent in their home. Bring your dog a blanket the cat has slept on and play with him while he smells it. This will help your dog associate your cat’s scent with positive experiences. Similarly, you can take one of your dog’s blankets or toys to your cat during playtime, so she learns to recognize the dog as part of her family. If your cat realizes your dog isn’t something to be feared, she’ll be less likely to run from him, which can provoke an Afghan hound.
Before you introduce your Afghan hound to your cat, you’ll need to ensure he knows how to follow basic commands like “sit” and “stay.” Training your dog to follow fundamental commands while you’re introducing him to a cat will add unnecessary stress to your life, and it could have tragic results. In this case, it’s much better to be safe than sorry. Use positive reinforcement when you’re training your dog, as you’ll see much faster results than if you scold him for not doing what you’ve asked.
You want your pets to get along so you can spend time with both of them at once, but suddenly opening the door isn’t the best way to introduce them. One method we recommend is feeding them on opposite sides of a closed door. They’ll come to associate being in close proximity with each other with being fed, something all animals look forward to. However, all dogs have distinctive personalities. If you notice your Afghan hound snarling at your cat through the door after they’ve eaten, discontinue this method immediately and move on to the next step instead.
With your Afghan hound on a leash, let your cat roam the common areas of the house so your fur babies can get acquainted. If your dog attempts to lunge for your cat, tell him “sit” in a firm, even tone. Reward good behavior, like your dog’s calmly sitting beside you while your cat walks around. Keep hold of his leash at all times; your pets may want to sniff at each other, but you need to remain in control of how close your dog can get to your cat. Continue meetings, gradually increasing the time your pets spend together, and keep an eye on your pets to make sure they’re not becoming agitated.
After your pets can remain in the same room, you can let them wander around together. Make sure your cat has access to a cat tree or install a cat door so she can escape to another room if she wants to be left alone. If your dog shows any signs of hunting your cat, separate them again and repeat the steps until they’re able to get along without issue.

While the previous methods are geared toward teaching older Afghan hounds how to get along with a cat, one of the easiest ways to ensure your dog won’t see your cat as a prey animal is to adopt a young puppy. When dogs grow up alongside cats, they see them as friends and playmates, not prey.
Afghan hounds are a clever and elegant breed, but they aren’t known for getting along well with cats. With patience, training, and a watchful eye, you can teach your Afghan hound to see the family cat as a friend, not a prey animal. While the best solution is adopting a puppy, even adults can be properly trained. In time, you’ll have a harmonious household, and your fur babies might even become best friends.
If you spend enough time on social media -- particularly sites like TikTok, Pinterest, or Tumblr -- you'll become familiar with "aesthetics." These are moods or styles that influence art, clothing and decor choices, and even what someone posts online. Any vibe can be an aesthetic if it drives your style choices, so why not let your favorite aesthetics inspire your new dog's name as well?
These canine monikers range from timeless to eccentric (and everything in between), but they all have one thing in common: They're all sure to put a smile on your face. Whether they remind you of something adorable, something nostalgic, or something totally epic, these cute dog names are the perfect wealth of information to start your search with. We hope this list leaves you feeling inspired!

Beagles are lovable dogs who melt hearts with their soulful eyes and long, silky ears. They conjure up images of a pack of hounds out on a hunt, a playmate hanging out with a kid, a hiking companion, or even a cuddle buddy at the end of an adventurous day. The beagle dog breed is certainly all of these wonderful things and more.
It’s believed that the ancestors of the people-loving beagle were small hunting dogs that English gentlemen used to track hares in the 1500s. Today, two varieties of beagles are recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC): the 13-inch beagle and the 15-inch beagle. The smaller dogs are under 13 inches in height, while the larger ones can measure over 13 and at or under 15 inches. Both have short coats and come in a variety of colors, with the most common being the tri-colored black, white, and tan. The other colors of the beagle dog breed are white and red, and the less common lemon and white. However, there is so much more to this dog than its looks.
We know dogs came to us from wild canines (likely wolves) and probably domesticated themselves rather than the other way around. In the process, different types of pups came about, possibly splitting into groups more than 5,000 years ago! To categorize all these beasties, the American Kennel Club (AKC) has a list of recognized breeds, each of which fits into one of the seven groups. We'll walk you through the breed groups so you can determine where your pooch fits best.
How do you classify dogs?
Dogs came from wolves and still share 99% of their DNA with their foreparents. Within the scientific world, dogs share a genus Canis with wolves, coyotes, and jackals. However, we generally don't recommend mixing these animals since our pets have become something totally unique.
