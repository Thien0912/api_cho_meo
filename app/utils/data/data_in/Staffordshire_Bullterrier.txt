The Staffordshire Bull Terrier shares the same ancestry as the Bull Terrier, which was developed in the 1860s by James Hinks who crossed Bulldogs with terriers and other breeds to develop a new type of dog for vermin control and blood sports. When Hinks later added other terriers and breeds, some that changed the head shape, of the breed, devotees of the original type of Bull Terrier cross remained loyal to their preferred type, from which the modern Staffordshire Bull Terrier is derived. It was not until the 1930s that The Kennel Club recognised the breed. It carried the name Staffordshire as the breed was developed in the Black Country of Staffordshire and northern parts of Birmingham.
Unlike other breeds it is shown traditionally in a broad leather collar ornamented with brass emblems, containing the Staffordshire Knot – as a tribute to its origins.
Despite its rough and ready beginnings, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is known as a wonderful family pet. Their intelligence and affinity with children are noted in the breed standard.
Dogs originally bred and used for hunting vermin. 'Terrier' comes from the Latin word Terra, meaning earth. This hardy collection of dogs were selectively bred to be extremely brave and tough, and to pursue fox, badger, rat and otter (to name but a few) above and below ground. Dogs of terrier type have been known here since ancient times, and as early as the Middle Ages, these game breeds were portrayed by writers and painters.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier also called the Staffy or Stafford for short, is a small to medium-sized terrier breed from the United Kingdom. Although developed in the 19th century to be small, fast, fighting dogs, those days are long past. Sadly, this reputation still lingers, and these highly affectionate dogs face much stigma. Even though these are purebred dogs, you will often find them in the care of shelters and rescue groups.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier temperament is affectionate, devoted, and playful. These loving dogs form strong bonds with their owners and are highly compatible with children. They are the epitome of “Velcro dogs” and can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for too long. Still, Staffies do best with experienced pet parents who can socialize them early and keep up with consistent training. You may want to research the breed’s requirements before bringing a Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy home.
When considering a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. There are many Staffordshire Terriers available in rescues across the country. However, if you decide to purchase a Staffy, choosing a reputable breeder is crucial. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Staffordshire Bull Terrier breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs. They also conduct necessary health screenings and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier can be an imposing dog with its strong, muscular body, intense stare, and powerful stance. Many are interested in the breed because it looks like a tough dog but is surprised to learn that the Stafford is a sensitive and loving companion who enjoys playing more than being tough. They see life as a joyful adventure and live it to the fullest. Fans love the Staffordshire Bull Terrier for their small to medium size, short, easy-care coat and dynamic yet gentle personality. With their short, broad head and muscular body, they resemble other bull breeds such as American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers, but they are a breed unto themself with distinct physical characteristics that set them apart, including size and ear shape. The Stafford is known for their love of people and trustworthy nature. They have been described as “a sort of everybody’s Dog Friday,” and their greatest desire is to spend time with their people, whether that means vegging out on the sofa and watching football, running errands in the car, going for walks, or participating in activities such as agility, flyball, obedience, and therapy work. Expect to give this athletic and energetic dog a vigorous walk every day and plenty of attention during downtime. They dislike being left to their own devices. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are not a breed that can be left outside alone or at home for long periods of time without human companionship.
Nicknamed the nanny dog, the Stafford is prized for its patience with and love of children, although no dog should ever be left alone with young children or expected to double as a babysitter. They are not always so friendly toward dogs they don’t know. However, a remnant of their origin as a fighting breed required them to be aggressive toward other dogs yet gentle with human handlers. Be aware that some municipalities restrict the ownership of bull breeds. Be sure that yours is not one of them before acquiring a Stafford. The Stafford is one of the finest dog companions around. This breed is best suited for people who understand their sensitive nature and can give them patient, firm leadership.
Loving and Affectionate: They are renowned for their affectionate and loving nature, often forming strong bonds with their human family members.
Small Yet Strong: Despite their compact size, Staffordshire Bull Terriers are muscular and powerful dogs, known for their strength.
Playful and Energetic: They have a high energy level and love to play, making them great companions for active individuals or families.
Good with Children: Staffies are often excellent with children, displaying patience and a gentle disposition, earning them the nickname “The Nanny Dog” in the past.
Intelligence: They are intelligent dogs and can be trained effectively, but they can also have a stubborn streak, so consistent training is essential.
Short Coat: Their short coat requires minimal grooming, making them relatively low-maintenance in terms of grooming needs.
Loyal Guardians: Staffordshire Bull Terriers protect their family and can be excellent guard dogs when trained and socialized properly.
Historical Origins: They have a history as bull-baiting and fighting dogs, but their temperament has evolved to be more family-friendly through responsible breeding.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier shares a common ancestor—the Bulldog—with the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier, and the Bull Terrier. They were created in the early nineteenth century to be smaller and faster in the fighting ring yet gentle and friendly toward people. They were probably developed by crossing the Bulldog with an ancestor of the Manchester Terrier. The cross eventually evolved into the Staffordshire Bull Terrier we see today. The first Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed in England in 1835, and a breed standard was written shortly thereafter. In the United States, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier generally enjoyed life as a family companion, and it wasn’t until 1975 that the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Stafford registered with the AKC was named Tinkinswood Imperial. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America was founded in 1974. Today, the Stafford is ranked 85th among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC. They are excellent dogs who truly embody the description of “man’s best friend,” and many enthusiasts know that they own one of the best-kept secrets of the dog world.
Staffords stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder, with males being taller. Male Staffords weigh 28 to 38 pounds; females, 24 to 34 pounds.
Loving toward people from just a few weeks of age, a proper Stafford is never shy or snarly. They are energetic and enthusiastic in everything they do and remain on alert, even in repose. This breed’s temperament is tough, courageous, tenacious (stubborn), and curious. A people-loving personality makes them a good caretaker of their family, but they’re less likely to be protective of property. Because they’re so attentive and interested in people, however, they’ll always alert you to the presence of visitors; wanted or unwanted. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who’s beating up their littermates or the one who’s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents–usually, the mother is the one who’s available–to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you’re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when they grow up.
Like every dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier needs early socialization–exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences–when they’re young, and it should continue throughout their life. Socialization helps ensure that your Stafford puppy grows into a well-rounded dog. Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking them to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and taking them on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all SBTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed. If you’re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy’s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog’s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In SBTs, you should expect to see health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and elbows, as well as from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy. Because some health problems don’t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren’t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn’t breed their dogs until they’re two or three years old. The following problems may occur in the breed:
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a companion dog who does well in any type of home as long as they exercise daily. They should live indoors, with access to a securely fenced yard. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers, so it is important to reinforce fences by embedding them in concrete or burying chicken wire at the bottom to prevent escapes. Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Stafford will ignore the shock if they see another dog approaching their territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, leading to a serious fight. Their short face makes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier unsuited to stay outdoors for more than a few minutes in a hot or humid climate, and they should always have access to shade and fresh drinking water. Some Staffords enjoy playing in the water and will appreciate having a kiddie pool to lounge in on hot days, but others prefer to avoid the wet stuff. Staffords are not good swimmers, so take steps to protect them from falling into a swimming pool or spa.
The Stafford’s exercise requirements can be satisfied with two or three half-hour to one-hour walks or playtimes daily. Engage their mind with training sessions or fun activities. Begin training the day you bring your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy home. They are intelligent and learn quickly but can be impulsive and stubborn. Forget strict and formal obedience training. Be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Stafford for best results. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing them for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog’s self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Stafford is destructive in their attempts to entertain themself. A Stafford is not generally a barker, but they are definitely vocal. This breed will entertain you with their snorts, snores, grunts, and groans, as well as their singing voice, often described as a yodel.
If you follow a schedule consistently, housetraining comes easily to the Stafford. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your SBT puppy from chewing on things they shouldn’t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren’t around to supervise. A crate also gives them a safe haven to retreat when they feel overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment. Leash training is also important, especially since your Stafford will be a strong puller, small size notwithstanding. Good leash manners are essential to your muscles, your happiness, and your Stafford’s safety. Never walk them off leash anywhere they encounter unknown dogs or other animals. They have a strong prey drive and will give chase if not restrained. Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your SBT to be friendly toward other animals. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn’t end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. With proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Stafford will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.
Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 2 1/4 cups of high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.
To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise. How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don’t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference–the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you’ll need to shake into your dog’s bowl. Keep your SBT in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day rather than always leaving food out. If you’re unsure whether they’re overweight, give them the eye and hands-on tests. First, look down at them. You should be able to see a waist. Then, place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with your fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without pressing hard. If you can’t, they need less food and more exercise.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the skin. It comes in red, fawn, white, black, or blue, or any of these colors with white or brindle or brindle with white. The Stafford’s coat sheds annually, and hair loss is minimal throughout the year. Dirt brushes out easily, and the coat dries quickly after a bath. Brush them weekly to remove dead or loose hair. Bathe as needed. This breed has little odor, so they usually don’t require frequent bathing. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Stafford’s teeth at least two or three times weekly to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim their nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they’re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don’t get caught in the carpet and tear.
Check the ears weekly to make sure there’s no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog’s breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don’t stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger. Begin acquainting your Staffordshire Bull Terrier to being brushed and examined when they’re a puppy. Handle their paws frequently–dogs are touchy about their feet–and look inside their mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you’ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they’re an adult.
The Stafford is suitable for families with children, but despite their much vaunted patience and gentleness, They should always be supervised in the presence of toddlers or young children. They can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock small children down. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent mouthing, biting, or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they’re sleeping or eating and not to try to take the dog’s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Some Staffords get along well with other dogs and cats when they’re raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the company of another dog. To ensure the best relationship, choose a dog of the opposite sex. Make introductions in a neutral area away from your home.
Staffords are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups in need of adoption or fostering. If you’re interested in adopting an adult Stafford who’s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.
If you are having trouble finding a Staffy-specific rescue, you can also check out rescues for Pit Bulls or Bulldogs, as Staffordshire Bull Terriers sometimes find their way into the care of these rescue organizations as well.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.
On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems or socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have health problems and behavioral issues.

Families or individuals looking for a loyal companion dog
Temperament:
Loving, loyal, and sweet-natured dogs with a reputation for loving kids
Bred originally in the 1800s from the old-fashioned Bulldog and the now extinct English White Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a medium-sized short-haired terrier that is one of several bull and terrier breeds that can trace its history back to the English blood sports of bull-baiting, bear-baiting, and dogfighting.
After these activities were banned in England in 1835 and attitudes to dog fights changed, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was refined through years of careful breeding to be the family pet and companion dog that we know today.
The breed was first imported in the United States in the 1880s and has since gone on to become a trusted, brave, and resolute companion to thousands of American families.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a breed that is formally recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC). Since 1974, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America (SBTCA) has been the official AKC parent club for the breed. The SBTCA maintains a list of registered breeders from around the country, which is a great place to start if you are looking to buy a new Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy.
Unfortunately, due to their bad reputation and the nature of some of their owners, far too many Staffordshire Bull Terriers find their way into dog shelters. So, if you are happy to adopt a slightly older dog, you may want to consider rescuing one from a shelter.
Following their arrival in the United States in the 1880s, breeders developed a taller and heavier version of the dog, which is now known as the American Staffordshire Terrier, or AmStaff. Both breeds have since been recognized as individual breeds by the American Kennel Club.
Despite their lean muscular looks and fighting dog backgrounds, Staffordshire Bull Terries are big softies at heart that make great family dogs.
Unfortunately, a small minority of owners are attracted to them because of their fighting background and go out of their way to abuse their dogs and turn them into mean, snarling, and aggressive animals. In truth, any dog that is abused can become aggressive, and unfortunately, the minority of people have given this breed an entirely undeserved bad reputation as an aggressive dog.
Despite having been in the country since the 1880s, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was not recognized as a breed by the American Kennel Club until 1974. Even in their home country, it wasn’t until the 1930s that the U.K. Kennel Club accepted them as a registered breed.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are tough, strong dogs that have an affectionate and loving nature. They are well known for their love of people, and they make dependable, friendly, and tolerant companions that are totally trustworthy.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are intelligent dogs, but they’re also freethinkers who can at times be a little stubborn. This has earned them a bit of a reputation for liking to do things their own way, and because of this, they need firm, patient, and consistent training.
Yes, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier makes for an amazing family pet. They are patient and tolerant dogs that love being around people and are wonderful with kids of all ages.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers like nothing more than spending time hanging out with their family, and that means they’ll be by your side all day, whether you’re watching TV on the couch, out for a walk or a jog, or running errands in the car.
The breed is suitable for apartment living provided that they get out each day for some exercise. However, they will generally be better off in a house that has access to a large secure yard in which they can run around and play.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are quite protective of family members. However, they are not overly concerned about property and will be more likely to make friends with somebody breaking into your house than stop them from making off with your new big-screen television.
Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to this question when it comes to Staffies.
If properly socialized and raised with other animals, many Staffordshire Bull Terriers will be okay living with other pets in the house. However, there are a good number of Staffies that regardless of the effort you make to socialize them, will just never be good with other animals.
As such, if you are looking to get one of these dogs, you should be prepared that you may need to live in a single animal home.

According to the American Kennel Club, Staffordshire Bull Terriers do best when they are fed a high-quality dog food that is appropriate to their age. This can either be in the form of a commercially manufactured dog food or in a veterinarian-supervised home-prepared meal plan.
However, as the breed tends to put on weight easily, careful management of their feeding is required to keep them fit and healthy.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers should never be free-fed, as they will simply keep eating until all their food is gone, so we recommend that you feed them twice a day with measured quantities of your chosen dog food. Half of their daily food intake should be given to them in the morning and the other half provided to them at night.
Staffies are, by nature, an energetic breed, and they should get at least 45-60 minutes of solid exercise every day. Usually, a good long walk in the morning or afternoon is all that is required to keep them fit. Having a large secure yard where they can run about and play will also help.
They are also quite prone to becoming lazy couch potatoes, so while they won’t complain if you don’t give them their required exercise each day, you will be doing them a disservice in the long run, as lack of exercise will ultimately affect their health and may negatively impact on their lifespan.
When planning their exercise, you need to keep in mind that Staffies aren’t big fans of the heat. So, if you live in a hot climate, it is important to keep them inside during the hottest parts of the day and take them out when early in the morning or after the sun goes down.
Because of their independent nature, training a Staffordshire Bull Terrier can be a little tricky. However, the key to success lies in remembering that they are intelligent dogs that like doing mentally stimulating things, and they love to please.
When training a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, you should try to keep the training sessions short and interesting, and you should also incorporate plenty of playtime and treats. These dogs will quickly work out that doing what you ask of them will both make you happy and result in them getting attention or a tasty treat, and from that point, as long as you can hold their attention, you should have no troubles.
Staffies have a short, smooth coat that is easy to maintain. They don’t shed much throughout the year, and as such, they’ll get by with just a quick brush once a week and bath when they need it.
They will need their nails clipped from time to time and should also have their teeth brushed weekly with canine toothpaste to prevent tartar buildup and bad breath from bacteria. As Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be prone to ear infections, it is also important that you check their ears regularly to ensure that they are clean and free of any redness and inflammation.
It is generally a good idea to get your dog used the grooming process while they are young. Even dogs that are as patient as Staffies can become annoyed with people brushing them, playing with their toes, or generally checking them over. By doing this regularly, your pet will come to accept the process as normal, and when they are older and stronger, you will find both grooming and veterinary checks are considerably easier if your dog is happy to let you check them over.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally quite healthy dogs, and provided that they’re well looked after, they should go through life without too many problems.
As with most breeds, Staffies are predisposed to genetic health complications. However, through responsible breeding practices, health screening, and DNA testing, these can now be largely avoided.
Of course, if you have any concerns about the health of your dog or the conditions they may suffer, the best person to speak to is your local vet. Health conditions that can affect Staffordshire Bull Terriers include:
When it comes to choosing a Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy, many people are not overly concerned about whether they get a male or female dog, choosing instead to base their choice on the personality of the individual dogs in the litter rather than their gender.
This is generally not a bad idea, as while there can be behavioral differences between male and female dogs, these can largely, if not completely, be eliminated by spaying or neutering your dog before they become sexually mature.
However, when it comes to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, there can be a considerable difference between the size and strength of male and female adult dogs. As such, it may pay to give consideration to your own strength and ability to adequately control a strong and independent Staffordshire Bull Terrier when out walking in public. If, for example, you are elderly, chronically ill, or slightly built, you may be better off choosing a female Staffordshire Bull Terrier over a male.

Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a bad and largely undeserved reputation as aggressive and dangerous dogs, when in fact, the opposite is the case. These dogs adore people, love spending time with their family, are affectionate, completely trustworthy, and great with children, and look tougher than they really are.
They make great family pets or companion animals, are suitable for apartment and city living, and are relatively easy dogs to look after.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is an amazing dog with a long history. Their medium size makes them well-suited to various living environments, and they are friendly and intelligent. However, many people would like to know more about them before bringing one home. If this sounds like you, keep reading as we discuss their appearance, temperament, grooming requirements, and common health problems to help you decide if this breed is right for your lifestyle.
Height:
14–16 inches
Weight:
24–38 pounds
Lifespan:
12–14 years
Colors:
White, blue, silver, red, brown, gray, black
Suitable for:
Families or those looking for a loyal, protective companion
Temperament:
Affectionate, courageous, energetic
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier breed got their start in England. They were developed by breeders who mixed Bulldogs with various terrier breeds. The idea was to have a dog with a strong bite and plenty of agility and courage. Sadly, people then used these canines for bull baiting and later pit fighting. Fortunately, after the banning of both practices, breeders started focusing on creating better companions, and today, most pet owners describe the Staffordshire Bull Terrier as friendly and affectionate.

Like most puppies, Staffordshire Bull Terriers have plenty of energy when they are small and will spend most of their time exploring their environment, which can get them into trouble if you don’t watch them closely. You’ll also need to socialize them with as many people, places, and other animals as possible to help them feel more comfortable around those things when they become adults. Start training early, and get them into a grooming routine so they are more likely to allow you to clip their nails and brush their teeth when they get older.
Finding a breeder shouldn’t be too difficult because these are popular dogs. However, ensure that any breeder that you choose follows breed standards and has the paperwork to go with your new dog so you can get them registered with the American Kennel Club or other organizations.
The temperament of your dog can vary because each has a unique personality, but most Staffordshire Bull Terriers are affectionate dogs that get along especially well with children. They form strong bonds with family members and have a non-stop desire for fun and games. They are also alert and fast, which makes them excellent guard dogs and protectors. They are incredibly smart canines that you can train easily to perform many tricks, and this breed is also a good choice as a service or rescue dog.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier can make a wonderful family dog. They form strong bonds with family members, get along great with children, and enjoy participating in family activities, whether inside or out. They often stay close to other family members and can suffer separation anxiety if their owners are gone too long. High intelligence contributes to their good behavior, and many owners refer to them as “nanny dogs” due to their helpful nature, especially with small kids.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier can get along well with other pets, especially if you socialize them with other animals as a puppy. Consistent training and positive reinforcement can also be useful. However, remember that each dog has a unique personality, and this breed has a strong prey drive that may cause them to chase other animals, especially smaller ones.

You should feed your Staffordshire Bull Terrier a high-quality diet appropriate for their age and health. It should list chicken, beef, or another meat as the first ingredient, and there shouldn’t be any artificial colors or preservatives. Follow the portioning recommendations on the package closely to avoid weight gain, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calorie intake. Contact your vet if you are having trouble deciding which food is best for your pet.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers will need at least 1 hour of exercise per day, split up into two or more sessions, to stay happy and healthy. Agility training, walking, running, fetching, and social activities are all great ways that your pet can get their daily activity, and you can adjust the length of time depending on their age and health.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are incredibly intelligent and can pick up new tricks quickly, which makes them ideal for children whom they need to protect and older adults whom they need to help. Starting training sessions while they are still a puppy and keeping them short and on schedule will help your dog get into a routine that they come to expect and even look forward to, especially if you keep them interested with positive reinforcement in the form of treats, petting, and praise.
A great part of owning a Staffordshire Bull Terrier is that they are relatively low maintenance. You will only need to occasionally brush them to remove loose fur and distribute natural oils, clip their nails if you hear them clicking on the floor, and check their ears frequently for signs of parasites and infection. You will also want to brush their teeth manually with pet-friendly toothpaste to help slow the progression of dental disease, which affects many dogs.
Males are usually larger and more muscular than female Staffordshire Bull Terriers and can be more territorial. Females are usually easier to train but are not as outgoing.

To debut their recognition by the Kennel Club of England, in August of 1935, they had their first club show with 60 Staffordshire Bull Terriers displayed.
Almost 40 years after the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was recognized by the KCE, the AKC added them to its prestigious list.
Staffordshire Bull Terrier Northwark Becky Sharp was imported from Australia, and she became the first U.S. Staffie AKC Champion.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a wonderful medium-sized dog that is perfect for most living arrangements. They form strong bonds with family members and get along especially well with children. They are also extremely intelligent and can learn new tricks quickly, making them suitable for jobs in search and rescue and as service animals. They often have a strong prey drive that can cause them to chase after other animals, but plenty of early socialization can help them get along with other pets quite well.

Staffordshire Bull Terriers have consistently been one of the most popular choices of terriers and for good reason. They are renowned for the kind natures when they are around people in a family environment even though they were originally bred to be fighting dogs. Staffies have also become one of the most popular dogs in the show ring and luckily this has not affected their traditional strong rugged muscular and much-loved looks. As a tribute to their ancestry Staffies are shown wearing broad leather collars with brass emblems on them which depict Staffordshire knots.
Staffies are fun to have around and although boisterous by nature through correct breeding handling and training these small to medium sized dogs develop into lovely characters that boast big personalities. Staffies like nothing more than a warm lap to curl up on and an owner they can look up to for all the direction and guidance they need with loyalty and devotion. Despite the breed's early origins Staffordshire Bull Terriers is renowned for being a lovely and loyal family pet as well as a trustworthy companion.
The breed remained popular right up to when blood sports were outlawed across the country although clandestine events were still held in the poorer areas of cities and towns. Dogs of this type grew in popularity although many of them did not survive in the ring or were cast aside for having lost a contest.
Because Staffies were originally bred as fighting dogs gaining recognition from the Kennel Club proved challenging and it was only in the 1930's that the Kennel Club officially recognised the Staffordshire Bull Terrier as a breed in its own right after Staffy enthusiasts established an acceptable breed standard which was a small dog with a malleable personality and one that boasted a real eagerness to please. Today the Staffordshire Bull Terrier remains one of the most popular family pets and companions not only in the UK but elsewhere in the world too.
Height at the withers: Males 36 - 41 cm Females 33 - 38 cm
Average Weight: Males 13 - 17 kg Females 11 - 15.4 kg
Staffies are small to medium sized dogs that boast a compact stocky and muscular appearance which gives them their tenacious look. They boast a broad skull with pronounced cheeks and short foreface with a very distinct stop that's unique to the breed. They have black noses and dark coloured eyes although some dogs with lighter coats may have lighter coloured eyes which is totally acceptable as a breed standard.
Eyes are nicely rounded and medium in size with dark rims which are set in a dog's head which means they look nicely to the front. A Staffie's ears can be half pricked or upright and nicely proportioned in relation to their head. They have ultra-strong jaws with a perfect scissor bite and very strong muscular short necks that go down to broad and powerful shoulders.
A Staffordshire Bull Terrier boasts strong forequarters with well boned legs that are set wide apart. Their feet turn ever so slightly outwards and their shoulders are powerful and well laid back. Their body is nicely proportioned and well defined with a deep brisket and strong rib cage.
Their hindquarters are extremely muscular and built to provide dogs with a lot of power when needed. Their feet are very well padded and medium in size being very strong and nails are always black. Staffies have medium length straight tails that they carry quite low in relation to their bodies.
Their coat is short smooth and close lying with acceptable colours being as follows:
The only colours that are highly undesirable in the breed under KC standards are liver and black & tan and any Staffordshire Bull Terrier with these coat colours could not be registered with the Kennel Club.
Staffies have a powerful action that's free moving and agile. They appear to cover a lot of ground with the minimum of effort. When seen from the front or back their legs move parallel to each other with lots of power coming from their back legs.
Male Staffies must have two normal testicles fully descended into their scrotums and if they are not this is considered a fault.
The sizes given in their KC breed standard are a guide only as to how tall and how heavy a Staffordshire Bull Terrier should be. As such some dogs can be shorter or taller and they can be lighter or heavier than stated in their KC breed standard.
Being intelligent dogs Staffies are easy to train and this includes house training puppies. They just love being around people and don't do well when left on their own for any length of time which could lead to destructive behaviours around the home. Staffies just cannot help themselves when it comes to showing their affection and will jump up so they can lick your face something that even the best trained Staffie cannot resist doing because it's just part of their loving personalities.
The "bad" press the breed has been given over recent years is not merited or well-founded because Staffordshire Bull Terriers when well trained and cared for make for wonderful well-behaved and affectionate family pets that boast endless amounts of energy and enthusiasm for life. They are a real pleasure to have around and share a home with.
Staffies need to be well socialised from a young age for them to accept being around other family pets and any introductions to new animals must be done gently carefully and slowly to avoid any aggressive behaviour. In general when well handled the Staffy shows a gentle and exceptionally loyal nature especially to one person which is typically the person who feeds them. They will also learn to obey commands relatively quickly but be warned - they can have a stubborn streak and can choose to ignore you when the mood takes them. They are also powerful chewers and will resort to chewing anything they can find around the home if left alone for long periods of time. This is simply because Staffies quickly become bored or stressed when left to their own devices. They also need to chew on things to keep their teeth healthy and in good condition. Chewing also helps older Staffies stay relaxed when they are feeling any stress.
Staffies are a good choice for first time owners because they are so people-oriented. However they thrive on human company and hate being left on their own which in short means they are better suited to households where at least one person stays at home when everyone else is out. They also need to know who is the alpha dog in a household because without the right sort of direction and guidance a Staffy might take on that role which can make them harder to manage.
A lot of Staffies have extremely strong prey drives and should not be allowed to run free in areas where they might come across smaller animals and dogs they don’t already know.
Although impressive in appearance a well socialised Staffy likes to play and they can play hard. They are not the sort of dog that will happily walk along taking things slowly when they could show a burst of speed and play and interactive game at full pelt.
Staffies are highly adaptable being just as happy living in an apartment in town as they would be living in a house in the country providing they are given plenty of mental stimulation daily exercise and not left on their own for any length of time which could result in a dog being destructive around the home.
Because Staffies are so people-oriented they hate it when they find themselves on their own and therefore they can suffer quite badly from separation anxiety. This often sees a Staffy being destructive and with such powerful jaws the damage a dog can do to furniture as a way of showing their stress is quite considerable.
Staffies are not known to be "barkers" but will be quick off the mark to let an owner know when there are strangers about or when something they don't like is going on in their environment.
No most Staffies do not like being in water and are not particularly good swimmers which is why care should always be taken when they are around any water courses which includes ponds rivers lakes and the sea.
When correctly socialised from a young age Staffies make very good watchdogs because they go about their duties in a very sensible way.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is known to be kind and tolerant towards children of all ages although because they are also known to play roughly and can be boisterous at times Pets4homes advises that Staffies are not the best choice for families with babies or very young children. Anyone who already shares a home with a Staffy and who has younger children should always make sure the children and their dog are never left together unattended. It is also crucial for parents to teach young children how to behave around dogs and when to stay away from them particularly when there is food around or during playtime.
Staffies need to be well-socialised when they are still puppies and introduced to as many other animals and situations as possible for them to be well-rounded mature dogs. However they can show aggression towards other dogs and pets which is why it's important they be introduced to each other slowly and carefully to make sure things go smoothly and that no pets get stressed out which could lead to aggressive behaviour.
A Staffy's breeding plays a huge role in their temperaments and how a dog reacts not only to other dogs but to other animals and pets. In short it's essential that potential owners make sure a puppy they are interested in owning has been well-bred nicely socialised and that their parents have stable and kind personalities too.
The average life expectancy of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier is between 12 - 14 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality diet to suit their ages.
Although a healthy breed the Staffy is known to suffer from a few hereditary and acquired health issues which are worth knowing about if you have decided to share a home with one of these delightful and affectionate dogs. The most commonly seen health disorders are as follows:
A few Staffies have been reported as suffering from this metabolic disorder which sees dogs display varying degrees of behavioural changes as well as dementia. Dogs suffer anxiety attacks and can experience full blow seizures. They are exercise intolerant and suffer from an unsteady gait (ataxia). They experience tremors and stiffness in their muscles. It is known to have an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and as such both parents must carry the defective gene in order to pass the condition on to their offspring.
All Staffordshire Bull Terriers destined to be used in a breeding programme must be screened prior to being used which can be done by sending a blood sample to the AHT in Newmarket. It is worth noting that results from blood samples usually take up to 6 weeks to be sent out and as such not dogs should be mated until their results are known.
Hereditary cataracts are an inherited condition and again it is an autosomal recessive disorder so both parent dogs must carry the defective gene to pass it on to their offspring. A puppy may be born with perfectly healthy eyes but this changes as time passes. The cataracts typically start developing when affected puppies are around 8 months or so old. The condition affects both eyes and because it is progressive dogs suffering from the condition will eventually lose their sight. All Staffies should be DNA tested more especially dogs used in a breeding programme. Blood samples are sent to the AHT in Newmarket and results can take anything up to 6 weeks to complete.
Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous has been reported in the breed and although the exact reason why some Staffies develop the condition it is known to be a congenital disorder that is non-progressive. In short Staff puppies are born with the condition but it does not get any worse. Puppies can be screened when they are 6 weeks old and if the disorder is deemed necessary it can be surgically corrected although the procedure is invasive and expensive to carry out. There is a genetic test available and it's essential for all breeding stock to be tested before being used in a breeding programme.
Staffies can suffer from PPSC which is a condition seen in other breeds notably the Golden and Labrador Retriever. The disorder does not typically affect a dog's vision and there is a BVA/KC/ISDS Eye Scheme available but it is worth noting that the disorder cannot be detected by screening litters. All stud dogs must be tested every year to establish they are clear of the disorder before being used for breeding purposes.
Staffy puppies would have had their first vaccination prior to being sold. After this they need to be vaccinated again following the guidelines below:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if even a dog needs to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be fully up to date.
Female Staffies can be spayed when they are 6 months old and not beforehand. Males can be safely neutered when they are 6 months old too providing their testicles have fully dropped into their scrotums.
Staffies are not known to be fussy eaters and some of them like their food a little too much. The problems can start when a dog is spayed or neutered and is when they could be prone to gaining weight. It's very important to keep an eye on a Staffy's weight and to ensure a dog is not being overfed or not given enough daily exercise bearing in mind that being obese will shorter a dog's life by several years and put them at risk of developing a lot more health issues.
Some Staffies may be prone to allergies whcih can be caused by various things and all too often finding the triggers proves challenging. With Staffies the most common causes are as follows:
Recognising when a Staffy could be developing a health issue and having them examined sooner rather than later often means their condition can be easier to treat. It does also mean that a dog is made to feel more comfortable as quickly as possible.
All Staffies destined to be used in a breeding programme must be screened and DNA tested for specific health concerns which are as follows:
The Kennel Club observes strict breeding restrictions which can be found on their site and which all potential buyers should be aware of. This includes the number of litters a dam has produced and her age.
Merle Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppies can no longer be Kennel Club registered because they are at greater risk of having both impaired vision and hearing due to the merle gene they carry. Any Staffies with the merle gene should not be used for breeding purposes.
It is mandatory for Kennel Club Assured Breeders to have their stud dogs tested for the following:
Another test that the Kennel Club recommends all breeders carry out on their stud dogs but which is not mandatory is as follows:
As with any other breed Staffies need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in tip-top condition. They also need to be given regular daily exercise so they remain fit and healthy. On top of this Staffordshire Bull Terriers need to be fed a good quality diet throughout their lives to ensure all their nutritional needs are met.
Staffy puppies are incredibly cute and well socialised puppies adapt well and quite quickly to a new environment providing they are not left on their own that is. Reputable breeders will only let their puppies go to their new homes when they are 8 to 12 weeks old and never earlier or when they are younger than this. The longer a puppy can stay with their families the better it is for them.
A puppy should have already been given the first of a series of vaccinations and have been microchipped. They would also have been wormed and all this information should be included in their paperwork. The documentation should include any health concerns the breed is known to suffer from and the puppy's KC registration information.
Puppies are sent to their new homes with a feeding schedule detailing what they have been fed and the frequency of their meals which is typically four times a day once a puppy has been weaned off their mother. Staffy puppies need lots of sleep which can be anything up to 21 hours in a 24-hour period. Because Staffy puppies are so cute it is all too easy to spoil them which is often the case. This can lead to all sorts of problems later on with adult dogs showing a more dominant and wilful side to their natures a condition known as small dog syndrome. It's essential to lay down some ground rules right from the word go to avoid this from happening.
Puppies need to be taught limits and boundaries although some Staffies will always test how far they can go. All dogs whether young or old like to know what is expected of them and who they can look to for direction and guidance. Even small dogs must know who is the apha dog in a household to prevent unwanted behaviours.
A new puppy should never be left on their own so it's crucial to time their arrival when there will be people around for the first few days. It takes puppies a while to get used to a strange environment and they need housetraining which must start as soon as they arrive. In short it's a good idea to take a few days off work to spend with a new puppy as a way of settling them that much faster without the stress of finding they are suddenly all alone.
It's also important to make a note of the next time a puppy needs to be wormed and as a guide this should be calculated from the date they were last wormed by the breeder:
Setting up a area for a puppy in a quiet part of the house is important because they need to nap throughout the day and the more peaceful an area is the better they would be able to relax and unwind. As previously mentioned puppies often sleep for 21 hours a day in between bouts of play. Placing a bed or crate somewhere that's quiet but not too out of the way will help them settle when they need to sleep. However it needs to be somewhere that owners can keep an eye and ear on them and so puppy knows there is someone around.
Getting everything ready for the arrival of a new puppy means making the home and garden safe for them. Puppy proofing takes organising things around the house but is something that needs to be done well in advance of a puppy's arrival because puppies are boisterous inquisitive and notorious for chewing on things they shouldn't which includes electric cables and other things they can swallow which could end up with an expensive trip to the vet.
Some owners buy playpens which are great for keeping puppies safe when they want to play and owners are too busy to keep a close eye on their pets. Other things needed for puppies include the following:
Staff puppies need to be fed a good quality diet that provides them with all the vitamins minerals and other nutrients they need to grow and develop properly. Ideally puppies need to be at least 3 to 4 times day until they are around 11 months old. If you are just about to get a puppy from a breeder they would recommend you feed them the same diet as they have been on and to gradually change this over a period of a few weeks to avoid the puppy developing a tummy upset.
Reputable Staffordshire Bull Terrier breeders would always make sure they give potential owners a contract which would include all a puppy's paperwork. The schedule should cover the following:
It is very important to stick the schedule for the first week or so but a puppy's diet can be changed once they are settled into their new homes providing it is done gradually and carefully over a period of 4 weeks making sure that puppy does not experience any digestive upset and if they do to change back to their original diet before discussing things with the breeder or the vet.
It's important to set up a routine as soon as a new Staffy puppy arrives in the home because this helps with their settling in period. They need to be fed at the same times of the day and ideally this needs to be 4 times a day until a puppy is around 6 months old after which time they can be fed 3 times a day till they are 11 months old. Below is a rough feeding guide of how much a Staffy puppy should be fed daily during the first months of their lives:
Like all other puppies Staffies can sleep or up to 21 hours in any 24-hour period which they need to do so they build up their strength for the next bout of playtime and so they continue to grow properly. It's important to keep noise levels down because they are sensitive to loud sounds and this includes noise from a television or any other device.
A puppy needs to have all their vaccinations at specific times so they are fully protected. It's essential to keep vet appointments not only for a puppy to be given their remaining jabs but so a vet can check them over too.
Staffies like other breeds slow down as they age which often means they are slower to respond to when they are called or maybe their hearing and eyesight are not as good as they once were which all needs to be factored into their management and care. Older dogs can be less eager to go out for walks but it's important not to let them become couch potatoes. They need to be given the right amount of mental stimulation which helps maintain their cognitive function through their golden years.
An older Staffy may get a little fussier about their food so it's important to rethink a dog's diet if necessary following the advice of an expert nutritionist or the vet
Having a short close-lying coat means the Staffy is low maintenance when it comes to grooming. A weekly brush and wipe over with a chamois leather is all it takes to keep their coats and skin in good condition. The same can be said for bathing them which should only really need doing from time to time. Overbathing a Staffy can destroy all the natural oils found in their skin and coats upsetting the PH balance and this can result in a dog developing skin allergies which some of them are prone to suffering from.
Just like other dogs Staffies shed more hair during the Spring and then again in the Autumn which is when more grooming is needed to keep on top of any loose hair and to prevent a dog from leaving it around the home. Setting up a grooming routine also allows owners to keep an eye on the condition of a dog's skin and to clean their ears when necessary because if there is too much wax in their ear canals it could lead to an infection taking hold and these are notoriously hard to clear up.
Investing in good quality grooming tools means they will last a lot longer than any cheaper ones and the tools needed when sharing a home with a Staffy are as follows:
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a high-energy dog and needs to be given a minimum of 1 hour's rigorous exercise a day when it comes to exercise or boredom will set in leading to some unwanted and often destructive behaviours. The more exercise a Staffy is given the better and more relaxed a dog would be and the old adage of a "tired dog being a good dog" is never truer than when it comes to describing these energetic little dogs. It is worth bearing in mind that Staffies are real athletes capable of scaling a 6-foot fence with no effort at all. They are also incredibly good at digging their way under fences which is something to bear in mind when leaving a dog in a back garden.
Staffies enjoy as much "off the lead" time as possible so they can really express themselves but they are not the sort of dog that can be let loose in a park or anywhere else where there are lots of dogs just in case they get into a fight.
Because they are such intelligent dogs they also need to be given lots of mental stimulation for them to be truly happy relaxed and well-balanced dogs. After a good amount of physical exercise and playing lots of interactive games a Staffy likes nothing more than to relax on a couch with their owner tired but an extremely happy dog.
Mature Staffies should be fed a small breakfast and then another larger meal in the evening but again their diet needs to be high in protein because they are such energetic dogs and as such they need the extra nutrients to meet their daily nutritional needs. The one constant no matter whether you feed a Staffordshire Bull Terrier wet or dry food you must make sure they always have access to fresh clean water at all times.
As previously mentioned a mature Staffy can be fed twice a day and as a rough guide the amounts they can be given are as follows:
A well-bred Staffordshire Bull Terrier can cost you anything from £700 to well over £2000 for a pedigree puppy.
The cost of insuring a male 3 year old Staffie in the north of England would be £21 for basic cover up to £47.30 a month for a lifetime policy (quote as of August 2017). It's worth bearing in mind that lots of things are factored into a pet's insurance premium and this includes where you live in the UK and a dog's age.
When it comes to food costs you would need to buy the best quality dog food whether wet or dry for your dog throughout their lives and to suit the different stages of their lives. This would set you back between £30-£40 per month. On top of this you would need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Staffy and this includes their initial vaccinations neutering or spaying a dog when the time is right and then their annual health checks all of which quickly adds up to over a £800 a year.
The total average cost to keep and care for a Staffordshire Bull Terrier as a rough guide would be in the region of £50 - £100 a month depending on the level of pet insurance cover you opt to buy but this does not include the initial cost of buying a pedigree Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
When buying a Staffy the size of a dog as stated in the Kennel Club Breed Standard is only a guide and is given as being the ideal for the breed. As such a Staffy could be smaller or larger and may weigh slightly more or less than the given size in their breed standard.
Staffies are an extremely popular breed both in the UK and elsewhere in the world which means that well-bred puppies command a lot of money. As such with Staffies there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:
