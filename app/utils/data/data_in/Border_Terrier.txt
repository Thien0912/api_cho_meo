Border Terriers are small dogs with big personalities that yearn to be part of a family unit. Their charming, spunky, and playful traits lend themselves well to families with children. Because of their rich history of hunting foxes, Borders are highly active and intelligent.

Border Terriers were bred to hunt, and today’s companion Borders still maintain many of their useful hunting characteristics. They are very brave, highly intelligent, and masters at escaping. They absolutely need to feel as if they’re part of the family and generally aren’t suitable for folks who want a “yard dog.”

Border Terriers aren’t a rare breed, but they’re definitely not as commonplace in the United States as they are in other countries like England. However, at the time of writing, the American Kennel Club’s Marketplace has several Border Terrier breeders with litters available in states like Oklahoma, New Mexico, California, and Rhode Island.
Because Border Terriers are prone to some genetic diseases, breeders must test their dogs for these conditions before breeding them. The Border Terrier Club of America recommends testing for hip dysplasia and evaluations of the patella and eyes, among others.1
Border Terriers originated around the English-Scottish border of Great Britain and quickly earned their reputation hunting hill foxes. Their speed helped chase down the foxes, and their compact size was incredibly useful for digging into their burrows. However, despite their fox-hunting abilities, they were not used in traditional British fox hunts.
The Border Terrier did not go unnoticed and became an officially recognized breed by the Kennel Club of England in 1920. Ten years later, this brave breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club.

Border Terriers are playful pups that are always on the go. They have tons of energy and enjoy going for walks and exploring their surroundings. These easygoing dogs are eager to please their human family members. Though they were bred to be country dogs, these adaptable pups can be just as happy living in the city, so long as they’re provided with plenty of opportunities to exercise outdoors.
Border Terriers are intelligent, quick learners. They’re relatively easy to train with the right motivation but can be a little willful at times. They can make great dogs for first-time dog owners, so long as potential owners know what they’re getting themselves into. They shouldn’t expect a dog that holds onto their every word, as Borders can be quite independent. Owners may want to consider attending a few training classes if they’re not yet comfortable with the thought of training their Borders without any experience.
Border Terriers are loving and loyal to their family members but can be wary around strangers. Socialization will help a bit in this regard, but you shouldn’t be surprised if your Border barks or growls when around people they don’t know.
Borders are loving and playful dogs with a seemingly infinite source of energy, which makes them perfect companions for families with children. However, they may be better suited for homes with older kids as their high energy and rowdiness can be too much for extremely young children. Borders can also sometimes be mouthy, which may be a problem for kids who don’t yet know how to respect boundaries. Training your dog will be a huge help in this regard.
Border Terriers can get along well with other dogs, especially if they’ve been raised together. In most cases, Borders do well with dogs of the opposite sex. However, the breed has a high prey drive, which may make them incompatible with other household pets like cats, birds, or mice.

Border Terriers do well with high-quality dog food diets or home-prepared meals, so long as your home-cooked meals have been given the thumbs up from your vet. Their diet should be well-balanced to ensure they receive all the nutrients necessary.
Adult Borders should be fed twice daily, while puppies will need to eat more frequently, up to four times a day. Regardless of age, treats should not make up more than 10% of your pup’s total daily caloric intake.
Border Terriers are highly energetic and active dogs that require daily physical activity. They’ll need, at minimum, one hour of exercise daily. You can split this into two or three shorter walks with some off-leash time in a secure area. On top of this dedicated exercise time, your Border will need plenty of playtime and training sessions.
A bored or under-stimulated Border will mean trouble as they’ll find a way to keep themselves entertained, and it’s not usually in a way you’ll appreciate. They will dig up your backyard or destroy your furniture, so make sure you’re providing plenty of physical and mental stimulation to keep bad behaviors at bay.
Training and early socialization are essential to ensuring a Border Terrier grows to be a well-mannered and balanced adult pup. Borders were bred to think for themselves, which can be quite frustrating for owners when it comes to training. For example, your dog might immediately “stay” when you tell them to, but they will only oblige for as long as they see fit before slipping off and going about their business.
Borders can have willful personalities that call for very patient guidance. They do well with positive, reward-focused training. They are very sensitive pups, and punishment will break their spirits.
Border Terriers have double coats consisting of a wiry outer coat and a soft, fluffy undercoat. As with most other double-coated breeds, these dogs will shed seasonally. A quick brush once weekly is typically all that’s needed during the non-shedding season to keep the coat looking its best. Owners will want to invest in a high-quality rake or stripping tool to use to get rid of the dead hair during the shedding season.
Baths should be kept to a minimum as the Border Terrier’s outer coat is a natural dirt-repellent. Bathing too often will compromise this ability.
Border Terriers are relatively healthy dogs with long lifespans of up to 16 hours. However, they can be prone to numerous genetic conditions that can be both painful and costly to treat.
Gallbladder Mucocele (GBM) is a condition marked by the distention of the gallbladder by mucus accumulation. This disease can sometimes be caught early, but a recent health report shows that most signs of GBM are not noticeable until surgical intervention is necessary.
Cushing’s disease is an endocrine disorder that sometimes can affect older Border Terriers. It occurs when the adrenal glands overproduce certain hormones.
Canine Epileptoid Cramping Syndrome (CECS) is a genetic condition with unknown causes. Affected dogs will get cramps randomly, ranging in both duration and frequency. A gluten-free diet has been shown to be effective in some cases of CECS.
Border Terriers may also be at risk for hip dysplasia, eye conditions like cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy, epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, and allergies.

The only notable difference between male and female Border Terriers is their size. Males are slightly larger than their female counterparts, but not by much. There are no differences in intelligence or temperament.
Border Terriers are highly skilled escape artists because they were originally bred to find their way into tiny underground warrens. If you plan on allowing yours free time in your backyard, you’ll need to make sure your fences are secure because they’ll find a way under or over in search of adventure.
Borders have a strong prey drive that makes them prone to bolting if they catch a glimpse of something interesting, like the squirrel in your backyard or a rabbit at the dog park. Even the best-trained Border will dash away if given a chance, so it’s important always to keep them on a leash.
The Border Terrier’s coarse and dense double coat consists of a tough, waterproof top coat and a softer undercoat for warmth. Their weatherproof coat was necessary as this breed was born to hunt foxes in all types of weather. Additionally, they have thick and loose skin to protect them from bites from their fox adversaries.

Border Terriers are fun, playful, affectionate, and spunky little dogs with big personalities and a lot to offer their families. They yearn to be part of a family unit and do not do well in households that prefer a quiet, background pet. They want to be involved in everything their owners are doing, especially if it involves being physically active outside.
Borders are intelligent dogs but can be tough to train, especially for people unfamiliar with training. Despite their small size, they can be fearless and may get themselves into trouble. They’re big on digging, and because they were bred to fit into small holes, they are excellent escape artists and diggers. Training and socialization are non-negotiables to ensure the pup grows into a well-mannered adult. If you’re new to dog ownership, you may wish to enlist the help of a professional trainer to get you started.

The Border Terrier is a small, medium-boned sturdy dog. The shoulders and body are narrow. The space between the eyes is relatively wide. The muzzle is short and usually dark, with a slight, moderately broad stop. The nose is black. The teeth are strong with a scissors bite. The small ears are V-shaped, set on the side of the head, dropping forward close to the cheeks and are usually dark in color. The medium-sized eyes are dark hazel in color. The front legs are straight and not too heavy. The medium-sized tail is thicker at the base and tapers. Border Terriers have a short, dense, wiry double coat that comes in red, grizzle and tan, blue and tan, or wheaten. There may be a small amount of white on the chest. A dark muzzle is desired in the show ring.
The Border Terrier is an alert, bold little hunter. Very agile, it is willing to squeeze through a narrow space to capture any quarry that may be on the other side. Lively, they enjoy playing with children. Affectionate, mild-mannered dogs that aim to please their owners makes them easy to train. This sturdy, scruffy, little terrier is a good watchdog, and may bark, but is not aggressive. Be sure to socialize them well. Puppies should be made accustomed to loud noises while they are still young to avoid excessive timidity. Puppies and adolescent Border Terriers are very active, but will mellow as adults provided they get plenty of exercise. Border Terriers like to dig; it is a good idea to install additional reinforcements along the bottom of fences. Good with family cats if socialized with them, however this hunting terrier has strong instincts and should not be trusted with non-canine pets such as hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, and birds. Be sure you are always your dog’s firm, confident, consistent pack leader, to avoid Small Dog Syndrome, and separation anxiety.
Height: Males 13 - 16 inches (33 – 41 cm) Females 11 - 14 inches (28 – 36 cm)
Weight: Males 13 - 16 pounds (6 – 7 kg) Females 11 - 14 pounds (5 – 6 kg)
Prone to Canine Epileptoid Cramping Syndrome (CECS), also known as "Spike's Disease." This is a recently recognized canine health problem and hereditary canine disease in Border Terriers. It can sometimes get confused with canine epilepsy. It is also being considered to be a metabolic, neurological or muscle disorder.
The Border Terrier will do okay in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. They are moderately inactive indoors and a small yard is sufficient.
Border Terriers were bred to hunt and have great vitality and stamina. They need plenty of exercise, which includes a long daily walk.
About 15 or more years
2 - 8 puppies, average 4 - 5
The durable, wiry coat needs to be brushed weekly and professionally groomed twice a year. The object is a completely natural look. The Border Terrier sheds little to no hair and is good for allergy sufferers. Bathe only when necessary.
It was in the Cheviot Hills near the border of England and Scotland that the Border Terrier was first bred. The breed is possibly one of the oldest types of terriers in Great Britain. The farmers had problems with foxes killing their stock and the Border Terrier worked alongside them to drive the fox out of their dens and kill them. They were small enough to follow a fox into the ground but big enough to keep up with the horses. The dogs were often not fed by the farmers in hopes it would make their prey drive even higher and they had to hunt to survive. Along with fox they hunted otters, marten, the fierce badger, mice and rats. Today while the Border Terrier is mostly a companion dog, he can still serve as a fine farm dog, helping to control vermin. The Border Terrier was recognized by the British Kennel Club in 1920 and by the American Kennel Club in 1930. Some of the Border Terrier's talents include: hunting, tracking, watchdog, agility, competitive obedience and performing tricks.

Border Terrier CharacteristicsEnergy+ High-energy dogs will need a lot of mental and physical stimulation to stay happy and healthy, while low-energy dogs require minimal physical activity. It’s important when choosing a dog to make sure their energy levels match your lifestyle or vice versa. Trainability+ Easy-to-train dogs are more skilled at learning prompts and actions quickly with minimal training. Dogs that are harder to train will require a bit more patience and practice. Health+ Some breeds, due to their size or their breeds potential genetic health issues, have shorter lifespans than others. Proper exercise, nutrition, and hygiene also play an important role in the lifespan of your pet. Lifespan+ Some dog breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, and some more than others. This doesn’t mean that every dog will have these issues, but they have an increased risk, so it’s important to understand and prepare for any additional needs they may require. Sociability+ Some dog breeds are more social than others, both towards humans and other dogs. More social dogs have a tendency to run up to strangers for pets and scratches, while less social dogs shy away and are more cautious, even potentially aggressive. No matter the breed, it’s important to socialize your dog and expose them to lots of different situations.

Border Terriers make wonderful family dogs and you will love them if you suffer from allergies, as they don’t shed as much as other breeds. They get along well with children and other pets, though this can depend on how early they are introduced so if you adopt an older dog, some training may be required.
The Border Terrier is a loving and playful breed that makes them a great dog for families and the single owner. It’s adaptable and can learn to live in a small apartment. It’s extremely intelligent and learns new tricks quickly, but it can also be quite stubborn and difficult to train for someone without experience and plenty of patience.
It’s also clever and can figure out how to open gates, doors and get around other things meant to stop it. It also likes to bark, so you will need to start early with training to keep it from getting out of hand. However, the barking helps them be great watchdogs, and you will always know when something strange is going on in your yard. Its fearless behavior will protect you regardless of the danger to its own life but can make it difficult to walk the dog where other dogs go.

The Border Terrier is a loving and playful dog with plenty of energy for chasing after balls, playing fetch, and running around the yard. It loves to be around children, and they will help it get the exercise it needs. It loves big yards but is adaptable to smaller homes as well.
It is protective and will keep your family safe from intruders. It likes to explore on its own, so it won’t mind as much as many other breeds if you have a long day at work.
If you start socializing your Border Terrier with other pets, it will likely grow to enjoy their company and even begin to protect them. However, it often sees other dogs as threats, and cats can activate its instinct to hunt. It can also be difficult to bring new animals into the house to replace ones that pass on.

Border Terriers are extremely active dogs, so they will require food with plenty of protein. Most brands that have chicken, turkey, or other real meat listed as the first ingredient should work perfectly. Avoid foods with meat byproduct listed above real meat, chemical preservatives, and artificial colors.
Some brands will also contain omega fats that can help produce a shiny coat and reduce inflammation. Probiotics can help balance the digestive system and reduce the frequency of diarrhea and constipation while boosting the immune system. We highly recommend following the portion guidelines listed on whatever food you choose to reduce your dog’s risk of becoming overweight.

Your Border Terrier will require plenty of exercise to stay happy and healthy. It’s one of the most active breeds, and we recommend setting more than one hour aside each day to help your dog stay fit. As we mentioned earlier, this breed enjoys chasing balls and will do it all day long if you keep throwing it, especially when they are still young.
Long walks can help if you can find an area where there aren’t a lot of other dogs that might cause your dog to get aggressive.
It can be difficult to train your border terrier because they can be stubborn and can lose focus if they detect an intruder in the yard. We recommend setting up training sessions at the same time each night to get your dog into a routine. Starting these sessions early in life will help your dog get used to learning, and they might come to enjoy it.
Keep plenty of treats ready as you repeat a command and motion what you want your dog to do. If your dog follows your command, give it a treat and try again. It can take several attempts before your dog commits it to memory and obeys on the first or second try. We recommend keeping the sessions short.
5 or 10 minutes per day should be more than enough to try out a few commands before your dog loses focus. A positive attitude, patience, and consistency are the most important part of your training program.
The Border Terrier has a double coat that helps it thrive in cold weather. It’s not a heavy shedder but will shed the coat in spring and fall and can leave quite a bit of hair around your home if you don’t frequently brush it at this time to collect the fur. During the offseason, you should only need to brush the coat once or twice per week.
We highly recommend brushing the dog’s teeth with a safe pet toothpaste to help slow the progression of dental disease, which affects many dogs. If your dog is an apartment dweller, you may also need to trim the nails if you hear them clicking on the floor.

Male Border terriers tend to be slightly larger than females, but there are no differences in temperament or intelligence.

The dogs were originally bred to live on farms and in rural areas, where they would need to hunt small prey like rabbits and rats for food.  Their strong hunting instincts still show today.
While the breed had been around for centuries in the UK, it only gained official recognition in the U.S. in 1930 when the AKC registered it.  The Border Terrier’s popularity has since steadily increased and is known today as an energetic and devoted pet.
Farmers judged Border Terriers based on their ability to drive foxes from their dens, and if they couldn’t do this, they weren’t considered true working Border Terriers.

The Border Terrier is a great family best, but it is better suited to an experienced user who can train it and properly socialize the dog so it behaves and can cohabitate with other animals. It makes a great watchdog and s friendly, loyal, and protective of family members.
It doesn’t require a lot of maintenance, but you will need to put up with a considerable amount of barking. We hope you have enjoyed reading over this review and have learned some new facts.

Border Terriers are true working dogs in the purest sense of the term and essentially that's what they still are today. With this said they are just as happy living in a home environment being trustworthy loyal and affectionate members of a family. They have very specific characteristics which are not always welcome with everyone they meet and Border Terriers have a tremendous amount of stamina having been bred to follow horses all day long. As such they need a tremendous amount of daily exercise combined with lots of mental stimulation for them to be truly happy well-rounded terriers.
The one thing they need is to be kept busy mentally and physically otherwise boredom sets in which can lead to a Border Terrier getting up to quite a bit of mischief around the home. These attractive little dogs have been around for a long time and as their name suggests they originate from the border between Scotland and England. They boast an interesting ancestry which they share with thePatterdaleBedlingtonandDandie Dinmont Terriers. However it was only in 1920 that they were officially recognised by the Kennel Club.
The Border Terrier was originally called the Coquetdale Terrier or the Redesdale Terrier depending on which area they were bred. However by the end of the 1800's they were referred to as Border Terriers which many believe was because of their close association with the Border Hunt of Northumberland.
They share their ancestry with other breeds namely the Dinmont Terrier Bedlington Terrier and Patterdale Terrier. These little dogs were bred to be strong robust little terriers that were capable of coping with the bleak climate of the borders between England and Scotland. They were bred and used by local shepherds and farmers to keep the fox population under control. When foxhunting became a popular sport Border Terriers were used to chase foxes out of their lairs when they ran to ground. These little terriers were renowned for their stamina capable of following the hunt over great distances and still having the energy to continue working when the need arose. They are one of the UK's oldest native terriers with records of them dating back to the 18th Century.
It was during the 19th Century that foxhunting became a popular sport and Border Terriers proved invaluable thanks to their stamina and tenacity when it came to tracking their prey and to flush out foxes when they went to ground rather than attack and kill them.
The dogs we see today are the same as the terriers that were bred back then with many enthusiasts believing them to be the "perfect" dog both in looks and nature for the task they were bred to do in the borders between Scotland and England. Border Terriers were officially recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1920 and over the years has gained in popularity to such an extent that they are among the most popular breeds in the UK achieving excellent results when competing at Championship levels too.
Height at the withers: Males 33 - 40 cm Females 28 - 36 cm
Average Weight: Males 6.0 - 7.0 kg Females 5.0 - 6.5 kg
Border Terriers have coarse dense top coats with a close softer undercoat and they have very thick skin. When it comes to acceptable Kennel Club breed colours these are as follows:
When Border Terriers move they do so with purpose having the stamina to keep going all day long without showing any tiredness. Their gait is busy and they cover a lot of ground when they need to with the minimum of effort.
The Kennel Club frowns on any exaggerations or departures from the breed standard and the seriousness of the fault would be judged on how much it affects a dog’s overall health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform.
Male Border Terriers must have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums and it is worth noting that the size of a Border Terrier can be a little smaller or slight bigger as well as being a little taller or slightly shorter than stated in their Kennel Club breed standard which is to be used only as a guide for the breed.
Border Terriers are not like other terrier-types to look at or in nature. Their raggedy appearance disguises well their affectionate loveable albeit independent natures with their cheeky otter-like looks. They are often described as being "energetic terriers known for their gameness" which is a very good way of describing these little dogs because they do need to be kept busy to be truly happy and well-balanced characters. Border Terriers retain their strong instinct to chase down prey and like nothing better than to be outdoors doing what they do best which is just that. With this said providing they are given enough to do and lots of physical exercise they fit in well as a family pet and thrive in a home environment.
As with other terriers and dogs in general the Border Terrier really does need to be well-socialised from a young age so they get on with other animals commonly kept as family pets and this includes cats. However if a neighbour’s cat ventures into their territory a Border Terrier would see them as "fair game" and would not be able to resist chasing a visiting cat off the property.
Border Terriers are intelligent little dogs which means they learn things quickly both the good and the "bad". They can be a little stubborn at times and if they think there is something more interesting to do they are more than likely to ignore a command and go off and do their own thing. On top of this because the Border Terrier boasts a high prey drive it's important for gardens to be made very secure because these little dogs will try to get over or under a fence when the mood takes them. They are known to be highly skilled escape artists.
Although hardy the Border Terrier is a sensitive character and responds well to positive reinforcement training. These terriers do not respond well to any harsh handling. Their training needs to start as early as possible when puppies are at their most receptive and their education must continue throughout their lives to remind them of their place in the pack which typically needs gently doing from time to time.
Border Terriers are very good at agility all thanks to their active and lively natures. This paired to the fact they love nothing more than to be kept busy means they excel at canine sporting activities like Flyball loving every minute of the attention they are given when they take part in any competitions.
Border Terriers although affectionate and kind by nature are not the best choice for first time dog owners because they need to be trained and socialised by people who are familiar with their specific needs bearing in mind that Border Terriers are truly working dogs which is a trait that is deeply embedded in their psyche.
Border Terriers are known to be real comedians when the mood takes them and enjoy playing lots of interactive games. They are particularly good at sporting activities which includes agility which they thoroughly enjoy more especially as it typically involves running through tunnels.
Border Terriers are adaptable little dogs but they do a whole lot better living in the country environment or in a house with a large back garden providing the fencing is ultra-secure which cannot be stressed strongly enough where these little terriers are concerned. Given that they need a tremendous amount of daily exercise and mental stimulation a Border Terrier would not be as happy living in an apartment in town or being left to their own devices for any length of time.
Border Terriers form strong ties with their families and owners which means they hate being left on their own for any length of time which can result in a dog suffering from separation anxiety. This can lead to a dog developing unwanted and destructive behaviours around the home.
When unhappy or left to their own devices a Border Terrier would show their displeasure at the situation by barking incessantly which is their way of getting the attention they thrive on. With this said they can be taught not to bark unnecessarily providing this part of their education starts early and dogs are not told off too harshly when they do bark. The reason being that Border Terriers might be robust but they are sensitive by nature and therefore do not respond well to harsh words or correction.
Some Border Terriers like water although they are not the best "swimmers". Other dogs hate water and it would be a mistake to force a Border Terrier to take a swim because it would end up frightening them even more.
A Border Terrier would be quick to let an owner know when there are strangers around or when they are unhappy about a situation and being so tenacious and bold they are known to be good watchdogs protecting their families and properties without hesitation at all.
Border Terriers are highly intelligent little dogs which means they are very easy to train when they are given the right sort of guidance from an early age. However they are also very sensitive little dogs by nature and therefore do not answer well to any sort of harsh correction or raised voices. With this said they are known to be quite independent thinkers and as such they need firm and fair handling right from the word go. The problem is that if a Border Terrier spots something more interesting in the distance they are quite likely to go off an investigate it rather than obey a command.
It's also essential for these terriers to be well socialised from a young age and training needs to be consistent throughout their lives for them to be truly well rounded obedient dogs. Just like children Border Terriers must be taught good manners when they are still young and providing they are given enough daily vigorous daily exercise combined with a lot of mental stimulation they are great fun to train and be around.
Border Terrier puppies need to be shown the ground rules and boundaries as soon as they arrive in their new homes so they know who they can look to for direction and guidance. The basic commands a puppy should be taught are as follows:
It's important to understand that even the best trained Border Terrier can be a little stubborn wilful and unruly when the mood takes them which is why they are best suited to people who are familiar with their specific needs.
Border Terriers are generally very well behaved around children although any encounters should always be supervised by an adult. These terriers are very affectionate by nature but they are also extremely energetic which means that even though they are small dogs they might accidentally knock a toddler over and this could end up scaring the child which could result in them being fearful of other dogs too.
When it comes to animals and other pets as long as a Border Terrier has been well socialised and introduced to a cat or other pet when they are young. they generally get on well with them. However because these terriers boast a high prey drive it is never a good idea to leave them alone with a guinea pig pet rat or other type of pet rodent because a Border Terrier might not see them as a pet but rather as "prey" and the results could be disastrous.
The average life expectancy of a Border Terrier is between 12 to 14 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality well-balanced diet to suit their ages.
Border Terriers are hardy little dogs that rarely fall ill. However there are certain genetic health disorders that are known to affect the breed more than other dogs and this includes the following conditions:
A puppy would have been vaccinated before they are sold but it is then up to the owner to ensure they have their follow-up shot with the schedule being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a dog should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A male Border Terrier can be neutered when they are 6 months old and the earliest females can be neutered is when they are 6 months old too.
Border Terriers are not known to put on weight too easily but any neutered or spayed dog may put a little weight and owners should keep an eye on their pet’s waistline and adjust the amount of daily exercise they are given as well as their calorie intake and to adjust things accordingly.
Some Border Terriers develop allergies and it’s important to treat a condition before it turns too nasty which can make it more of a challenge to clear up. There are many things that can trigger an allergic reaction and this includes the following:
Establishing what triggers an allergy can take time but the sooner a dog sees the vet the quicker they can be made to feel more comfortable.
Currently there are no BVA/KC health schemes available for the breed but all breeders must have stud dogs tested for Shaking Puppy Syndrome (SPS) through the Animal Health Trust (AHT) which is a simple swab test.
There are no breed specific breeding restrictions in place for the Border Terrier.
For the moment there are no DNA tests or veterinary screening schemes available for the Border Terrier under the Kennel Club Assured Breeder Scheme but all potential owners should discuss any health issues known to affect Border Terriers with breeders before buying a puppy from them.
As with any other breed Border Terriers need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in tip-top condition. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to make sure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this these little dogs need to be fed a good quality diet and one that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
Border Terrier puppies are very cute and they are also extremely smart which means it is essential for homes and gardens to be puppy-proofed to ensure they stay safe when they arrive in their new homes. Even puppies are tenacious and will find the weakness point in a fence when they want to because Border Terriers are extremely good “escape artists”. It is a good idea to dig in some chicken wire around fences which is a good way of preventing a puppy from digging their way out of a garden. Fences also need to be quite high because Border Terriers are excellent “climbers” too.
All puppies like to chew on things and this includes the Border Terrier so it’s essential that all electric wires and cables are well out of a puppy’s reach just in case they decide to gnaw on them. It’s also important to set up a quiet area for a puppy so that when they want to take a nap they can retreat to it bearing in mind that puppies need a lot of sleep which can be up to 21 hours a day. If there are any children in the house they should be taught when to leave a puppy alone which is when they are eating and sleeping.
Border Terrier puppies are not difficult to house train because they are smart and quickly learn where to do their business. However if a puppy does have an “accident” it’s best not to tell them off too harshly because Border Terriers are sensitive by nature and it could end up having an adverse effect on them.
The documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are items needed to care for a puppy which should be purchased well in advance of their arrival. The items needed include the following:
All puppies are very sensitive to loud noises so it is important to keep the volume of a television down and not to play music too loudly either because it could frighten a Border Terrier puppy and prevent them from napping as they should during the day.
Reputable breeders would always ensure their puppies vaccinated before they are sold but as previously mentioned it is up to their new owners to make sure they are given their follow-up shots at the right time which should be as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be
When Border Terriers reach their golden years they slow down in certain ways and might start showing their age with more grey hairs appearing on their faces and more especially around their muzzles. Apart from a change in their appearance owners often notice a change in a dog’s personality too and this includes on how quickly they respond to a command or when their names are called. The reason for this is that many older dog's hearing is not as good as it once was. Other changes to watch out for could include the following:
Border Terriers have short coarse coats with a close undercoat which means they are quite easy maintenance in the grooming department. However a weekly brush is necessary to get rid of any loose hair and it's important to make sure their paws are kept nice and tidy too. As with other breeds the Border Terrier sheds the most during the Spring time and then again in the Autumn when more grooming may be necessary to keep on top of things. It's also a good idea to have a Border Terrier hand stripped from time to time which is another way of controlling their shedding and it makes keeping their coats looking good that much easier too.
These little terriers do not need a lot of bathing but because they like to go down burrows they may get a bit muddy from time to time which could mean they need to be given a bath. However it's important not to overdo bathing a Border Terrier because it could result in upsetting the natural PH balance of their skin which could lead to a irritation. It's also important to always use a dog-specific shampoo when you bath them too for the same reason.
Having the right grooming tools helps keep a Border Terrier’s coat and skin in top condition. The tools needed to keep a dog's coat looking good are as follows:
Border Terriers need to be given lots of exercise but they also need to have a tremendous amount of mental stimulation to be truly happy well-balanced dogs. They are the ideal choice of pet for people who enjoy spending as much of their free time in the great outdoors with a canine companion. However these little terriers would not be happy if stuck indoors for great lengths of time. One thing a Border Terrier is not it's a couch potato although once they've been out for a nice long and interesting walk they are quite happy to chill out on a sofa with you.
They also need to be given lots of mental stimulation which involves playing fun and interesting interactive games with them as often as possible. As previously mentioned there's nothing these little dogs enjoy more than playing Flyball and other canine sporting activities.
Border Terriers are not fussy or finicky when it comes to their food. In fact quite the opposite is true they are known to like their food a little too much which can often lead to obesity. However it's not necessary to feed these little dogs a diet that's high in protein but it is important to feed them good quality dog food that contains all the nutrients they need to remain healthy.
If you've decided to pet a Border Terrier puppy the breeder would let you know the sort of diet they have been on and you would need to continue feeding them the same food to avoid a puppy from developing any tummy upsets through a change of diet. Puppies need to be fed at regular intervals throughout the day and ideally this needs to be either 3 or 4 times a day. You can change their diet gradually over a period of a couple of week without risking any digestive upsets when the time is right and if you have any concerns it's best to discuss things with your vet before you do anything.
Older Border Terriers as previously mentioned will eat until they burst if allowed to so it's important to gauge the amount of food they are given in relation to the amount of daily exercise they get. Like this a dog won't be at risk of putting on too much weight which can put stress on their limbs joints and hearts. It is now known that when dogs carry too much weight it can shorten their life spans by several years.
Once a puppy is 11 months old they can be fed adult dog food.
If you are looking to buy a Border Terrier you would need to pay anything from £450 to well over £800 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year old Border Terrier in the north of England would be £16.77 a month for basic cover but this rises to £38.15 a month for a lifetime policy (quote as of August 2017). It's worth bearing in mind that lots of things are factored into a dog's insurance premium and this includes where you live in the UK and their age and breed.
When it comes to food costs you would need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry for your dog throughout their lives and it must suit the different stages of their lives too. This could set you back between £25 - £35 a month. On top of this you would need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Border Terrier which includes their initial vaccinations neutering or spaying them when the time is right and then their annual health check visits all of which can quickly add up to over a £800 a year.
As a rough guide the total average cost to keep and care for a Border Terrier would be between £50 - £85 a month depending on the level of pet insurance you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred pedigree Border Terrier puppy.
