The Chow Chow is an ancient dog breed hailing from China. These cat-like dogs are deeply devoted to their families.


Meet the Chow Chow – the adorable dog that stands out from other breeds because of their wrinkled faces and fluffy coats. Chow Chow’s aren’t just lookers, you know. In fact, there’s a lot more to these adorable pups. They boast a very engaging personality and a fascinating history as China’s esteemed guardians.
If you have ever seen a pic of this pup, you are already as enamored as we are, so why not learn a little more? Let’s dive into the ancient roots of the Chow Chow!

These cute furballs began leaving their paw print all over history during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE) in ancient China. But they weren’t just adorable pals to throw the ball with; they had a serious job. We aren’t joking; these pups were actually used as guardians of the emperor’s palaces and hunting grounds.
The Chow Chow’s role expanded beyond imperial duties, thanks to their unique look and lion-like mane. Soon, they were loved not only by the royals but by everyday people as well. Eventually, sailors grabbed onto the breed, and they brought them on ships as companions, spreading their charm worldwide.
Fast forward to the 1800s, and these fluffballs created a stir in Europe, becoming the favorites of royals like Queen Victoria. The Chow Chow kept changing as time rolled on, adapting to new places and becoming cherished family members. Today, their rich history still echoes in their noble attitude and distinctive appearance.

A majestic lion’s mane and the snout of a bear are the trademarks of this jaw-dropping canine. It is no wonder that people rave about the unmistakable charm of the Chow Chow. But there’s so much more to this delightful breed than meets the eye, and that adds to their world-renowned royal-like elegance.
Among their defining features is also a robust build and a gracefully curled tail that rests across their back. What sets them apart even further is their luxurious double coat, which is a sight to behold. However, it’s far from a one-size-fits-all scenario. The Chow Chow flaunts a diverse range of coat colors, from creamy hues to fiery reds and even bold blacks.
On top of all this, there is one more thing that adds an extra touch of charm to these already cute pups: their unique blue-black tongue! This is nothing to worry about; it’s just another thing that makes the Chow Chow stand out from other breeds.

They may look adorable, but if you are anything like us, a pup’s appeal isn’t all about the looks; it has to do with their personality, too. The Chow Chow tends to be independent and dignified, like a canine aristocrat. But don’t mistake their serious expression for grumpiness; it’s just their way of being cool and collected.
They can be a little aloof, though (they’re known for being a cat-like dog breed). That’s right, they are all about getting love on their timetable, so just be prepared to get that canine love when they feel like it, not when you want it.
Don’t be discouraged because even though they are a little stubborn and a bit aloof, the Chow Chow isn’t just a stoic guardian. They’re also known for being quite playful and affectionate with their loved ones. So, if you’re up for a mix of independence, loyalty, and a dash of regal charm, the Chow Chow might just be your perfect furry match.

Like a partnership with a wise companion, training a Chow Chow is a rewarding journey, revealing the depth of their intelligence and forming a bond that lasts a lifetime. But it won’t be done by simply snapping your fingers.
Chow Chows aren’t known for being wickedly intelligent dogs (like the Einstein Poodle), but with some patience, you can unlock their full potential.

Alright, let’s dive into the exciting world of training a Chow Chow with some tips to make it a breeze:

Now, let’s delve into the essential world of understanding and mastering the care and maintenance of the regal Chow Chow. With its unique charm, this breed does present some challenges in both health and grooming, requiring a knowledgeable and attentive pet parent.
So, let’s have a little heart-to-heart about the secrets to keeping your Chow Chow not only healthy and happy but also looking absolutely fabulous. It’s like having the ultimate guide to becoming the perfect pet parent.

When it comes to health, Chow Chows might face challenges like hip dysplasia and eye conditions, demanding attentive care through regular vet check-ups. These pups have a really calm demeanor, so reading their feelings might be a little challenging. This is why keeping your eyes out for any changes in personality or physical abilities is so important.
One of the ways to do that is to keep up with those regular vet visits (this includes staying up to date on their vaccinations). Also, make sure you keep them on a balanced diet so you can watch their weight.
Taking these steps will help protect against common health concerns. With proactive care, you’re not just a pet owner; you’re their health-savvy guardian.

Grooming is one of the most important things with any pet. But Chow Chows have some unique considerations because of their thick undercoat and bear-like physique.
Their opulent double coat requires special attention. Their “poof” makes these dogs prone to having mats, and matting can create skin irritation and sensitivity. So, for their coat to stay in peak condition, there has to be consistent grooming. This should be done regularly, a few times a week, to keep those mats at bay. There are also some special brushes and combs you can purchase online to keep your dog looking (and feeling) their best.

Another way to combat those mats and to address any skin sensitivity is to make sure that their bathing routine is done with gentleness. You want to make sure that their bath time is almost like a royal affair. Only use very dog-friendly shampoos. This won’t only help with skin sensitivity, but it’ll help their fur coat stay maximumly fluffy.
Finally, we know the coat is important and everything, but there is one specific finishing touch that must be included in the grooming situation. To ensure the distinctive lion’s mane and snout remain on point, you need to do a little bit of face cleaning, as well. Just like with little white dogs (like the Coton de Tulear), Chow Chows are prone to excessive tear production, leading to staining.

While Chow Chows may look all-knowing and wise, they’re still pups. This means that your dog will thrive even more if you give them enough attention. This can include daily doses of exercise and playtime, whether that is at home or the dog park. You can provide much-needed mental stimulation by buying puzzle toys and interactive games that keep their mind engaged.
Sure, your pup may not be able to have a full-on conversation with you, but these dogs have very expressive eyes. A Chow Chow’s eyes say a lot, and picking up on subtle clues can strengthen your bond.

Being a responsible pet parent is more than just doing the bare minimum. It’s a relationship that requires engagement and understanding. If you can do this, you may unlock a lifetime of unwavering loyalty and boundless joy with your pup.
That means the key to having a strong relationship with your pup is to really pay attention to their behavioral cues. Chow Chows have no problem letting you know their likes and dislikes. For instance, if you take your dog to the park and notice signs of aggression (like growling and raised hackles), it’s time to take a break.
Understanding any dog really boils down to embracing a holistic approach to care. If you can do that, your dog, whether it be a Chow Chow or another spitz breed, will be a happy, healthy, and fabulous companion for you.

The Chow Chow is a spitz-type of dog breed originally from Northern China.[2] The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough.[1]: 4–5  The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.[1]: 4–5 [3]
The Chow Chow has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.[4] A research study has concluded that the Chow Chow dog breed originated from other indigenous dogs in central China about 8,300 years ago. The ancient breed evolved and manifests both morphological and physiological features, including its dark tongue, coat of fur, and stronger build.[5]
One Chinese legend mentions large war dogs from Central Asia that resembled black-tongued lions. One Chinese ruler was said to own 5,000 Chows. The Chinese also used Chows to pull dog sleds through swampy terrain, and this was remarked upon by Marco Polo.[1]: 11
Today, the American Kennel Club registers approximately 10,000 Chow Chows a year. The Canadian Kennel Club registers approximately 350.[1]: 4–5
The English name Chow Chow is unlinked to any Chinese name such as the modern 鬆獅狗 (song shi gou, lit. "loose lion dog") for the breed, and hence of uncertain origin - possible and folk etymologies refer to Pidgin English.[6]
The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough.[1]: 4–5  The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.[1]: 4–5 [3]
Not all these color varieties are recognized as valid in all countries. Individuals with patchy or multicolored coats are considered to be outside the breed standard.
Chow Chow eyes are typically deep set and almond shaped. The breed is unique by their purple/blue-black tongue which no other breed has except Shar Pei, and has very straight hind legs, resulting in a rather stilted gait.[1]: 4–5  The bluish color extends to the Chow Chow's lips; this is the only dog breed with this distinctive bluish color in its lips and oral cavity (other dogs have black or a piebald pattern skin in their mouths).[1]: 4–5  Another distinctive feature is the curly tail.[1]: 4–5  It has thick hair and lies curled on its back. The nose should be black, but blue-coated Chow Chow can have a solid blue or slate-colored nose. According to the American Kennel Club breed standards, any other tone is not acceptable for contests.[7] FCI countries, however, do allow a self-colored nose in the cream.[8]
The blue-black/purple tongue gene appears to be dominant, as most mixed breed dogs that come from a Chow Chow retain that tongue color. However, the blue-black/purple tongue can also be found on the Shar Pei. This is not to say that every mixed breed dog with spots of purple on the tongue is descended from Chow Chow, as purple spots on the tongue can be found on other purebred dogs.[9]
Owning a Chow Chow can raise the cost of homeowners' insurance because some companies consider them high-risk dogs.[10] In a study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Chow Chow were responsible for 8 out of 238 fatalities related to dog bites from 1979 to 1998.[11]
Chow Chows can come in a variety of coat colors. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has classified Chow Chow colors as either standard or non-standard (rare colors). The standard colors for Chow Chows are black, blue, red, cream, and cinnamon. However, colors such as fawn, white, and merle are not considered standard for this breed.[12][13]
Different canine clubs worldwide may acknowledge different coat colors or even use alternative names for the colors mentioned above.[13]
A UK study found the life expectancy of the Chow Chow to be 12.1 years, just higher than the 12 year average for crossbreeds and lower than the 12.7 years average for purebreeds.[14]
A North American study looking at more than a million records of dogs found 6.44% of Chow Chow dogs to have hip dysplasia compared with 3.52% overall. The study also found 4.3% of Chow Chow dogs to have cranial cruciate ligament deficiency compared to 2.52% overall.[15]
Another North American study looking at more than 250,000 elbow scans found the Chow Chow to have the highest prevalence of elbow dysplasia, with 48.6% of dogs over the age of 2 having elbow dysplasia.[16]
A North American study looking at glaucoma in dog breeds found the Chow Chow to have the third highest prevalence with 4.7% of Chow Chow dogs having glaucoma compared to 0.89% overall.[17]
A study looking at records from a small animal clinic at the University of Montreal found the Chow Chow to be predisposed to alopecia X.[18]
A review of studies in Australia found the Chow Chow to be prediposed to atopic dermatitis with a 7.1 odds ratio.[19]
A US case study found a predisposition to pemphigus foliaceus with an odds ratio of 12.3.[20]
A breed specific mutation causing tyrosinase deficiency which results in leukotrichia exists in the Chow Chow.[21]
A UK study looking at exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in breeds found the Chow Chow to be predisposed to the condition.[22]
An Austrian case series found an odds ratio of 23.53 for contracting stomach cancer.[23]
A US study looking at cases of oral melanoma found the breed to be over-represented with an odds ratio of 7.89.[24]
In a Belgian study Chow Chow bitches made up 6.4% of cases of pyometra despite the breed making up 1.6% of the population. Pyometra was found to be more extreme in the breed with anaemia and endotoxaemia reported.[23]
The Chow Chow can suffer from diabetes mellitus,[25] and gastric cancer.[26] Chow Chows are a high risk breed for autoimmune disease.[27]
Sigmund Freud had a Chow Chow named Jo-Fi Ling who attended all of his therapy sessions because he felt that dogs had a special sense that allows them to judge a person's character accurately, and admitted he depended on Jo-Fi for an assessment of a patient's mental state.[28]
U.S. Navy admiral George Dewey acquired a Chow Chow in Hong Kong in 1898 and named it Bob. Bob rarely left the admiral's side and had the run of the cruiser USS Olympia. Bob died in 1899 from eating chocolates given to Dewey by well-wishers upon Olympia's arrival in New York City.[citation needed]
Walt Disney and his wife, Lillian Disney, had a Chow Chow named Sunnee. It was the couple's first dog. Allegedly, Walt gifted Lilly the Chow Chow inside a hat box, which inspired the scene in Lady and the Tramp where Lady is gifted in the same way.[29][better source needed]
--------------------------------------------------
The Chow Chow is a highly intelligent dog and values his independence. He can be hugged and played with. He can even be corrected -often by a tone of voice, but he should never be allowed to dominate the household.
He is usually amenable to being touched by strangers if he is introduced by one of his owners and approached properly.
Quiet, refined, he should not be teased or treated as a lap dog. His dignity and aloofness must never be confused with a fierce or intractable temperament. He minds his own business and does not generally initiate trouble.
Bad-tempered Chows are not representative of the breed, but are usually the result of indiscriminate breeding and a woeful lack of "socialization".
The Chow's appearance and personality suggest the nobility of a lion, the drollness of a panda, the appeal of a teddybear, the grace and independence of a cat, and the loyalty and devotion of the dog. The Chow has a little of all these qualities in his appearance and in his behavior. It is, however, his particular intelligence and devotion, his independence and dignity which make him unique.
It is often said by Chow owners who have had years of experience with Chows, as well as with other breeds, that the Chow is perhaps the cleanest dog of all. Most puppies are easily housebroken by the time they are eight weeks. The Chow has very little body odor if he is brushed often, and he does not seem to be readily accessible to every passing bug, vermin, or virus. He is a good eater, and he does not require a great deal of exercise so that he may live happily in an apartment.

The Chow Chow can be traced back almost 2,000 years when they were bred as hunting and guard dogs in China. Known for their cute, teddy bear-like appearance and a unique blue-black tongue, the Chow Chow is both independent but also very loyal.
The Chow Chow is an extremely loyal, very independent and highly intelligent breed. They have a low-maintenance personality that means they can often demand little in the way of attention or affection. In fact, they can be quite aloof at times.

Chow Chows are known for their thick woolly coats, that shed seasonally, and the breed is not considered to be hypoallergenic. It’s important to remember that no breed is 100% hypoallergenic, but there are breeds that are better for allergy sufferers than others.
Chow Chows can be trained to get on well with other pets, including cats. However this is an independent and aloof breed and they may not tolerate constant playing well. What’s more, this dominant breed will view themselves as pack leader, no matter what species their other pack members are, so it’s best to avoid introducing a Chow into your home if you already have very territorial pets.
Whilst they are independent and aloof in many ways, Chow Chows are also fiercely loyal and enjoy spending as much time as they can in their owner’s company. For this reason, Chows often suffer from separation anxiety and shouldn’t be left on their own for too long to avoid any unwanted or destructive behaviours.
Chow Chows don’t shed a lot on a daily basis but will have a heavy seasonal shed as during the transitions from summer to autumn and winter to spring. During these times, their coats may need a little more brushing than usual to help loosen and remove some of the excess fur.
Chow Chows are known to be very strong-willed and as such tend to need a more experienced handler when it comes to training. However, once the pack hierarchy is established, Chow Chows are intelligent and quick to catch on when it comes to learning new tricks and commands.

Choosing the right insurance for your Chow Chow can help keep them happy and healthy whatever happens. Conditions that we see they are prone to are not always covered as some other providers’ policies limit what they’ll pay for certain conditions, like cruciate ligament injuries. Others won’t cover your pet for dental illness or injury, or for congenital and hereditary conditions. With Petplan’s Covered for Life® dog insurance we have no additional limits for specific conditions or diagnostic tools.
--------------------------------------------------
These dignified, cat-like dogs bond deeply with their chosen person while maintaining that characteristic aloof demeanor with strangers.
Despite their independent nature, they’re incredibly loyal family guardians.
Before bringing home this distinctive square-profile breed, you should understand their:
From their striking cinnamon, black, blue, cream, or red coloring to their unique stilted gait, Chow Chows offer a one-of-a-kind companion for the right owner.

The Chow Chow’s cat-like temperament sets them apart from typical canines.
They maintain a reserved demeanor with a natural scowling expression that perfectly matches their aloof personality.
Unlike eager-to-please breeds, these ancient Chinese dogs assess situations carefully before engaging.
They’re quiet indoors. My blue-tongued companion spends hours lounging in her favorite spot, observing household activities with regal detachment.
Despite their independent nature, Chow Chows form deep attachments. They typically become one-person dogs, though they accept family members they trust.
Their loyalty resembles that of primitive spitz-type breeds – protective without being clingy.
With children, supervision is essential. Their low tolerance for rough handling means they’re better suited to homes with respectful older kids who understand boundaries.
Their interactions with strangers reveal their hunting breed history:
Early socialization helps manage these protective instincts. Even well-socialized Chow Chows maintain their dignified reserve, a trait that draws many to this distinctive breed.
The square-profile build and thick mane of the Chow Chow come with specific health challenges.
Hip and elbow dysplasia affect many due to their straight hind legs and muscular build. Regular vet checkups should screen for:
Their sunken eye appearance makes regular inspection crucial. Some bloodlines carry higher risks, so health clearances from reputable breeders matter significantly.
With an 8-10 year average lifespan, Chow Chows transition from puppyhood to senior status relatively quickly.
Their stubbornness can mask pain, making regular veterinary monitoring essential.
Senior Chow Chows benefit from joint supplements and modified exercise as their stilted gait becomes more pronounced with age.
Their double-coated canine heritage makes them remarkably cold-tolerant but prone to overheating. Heat sensitivity requires careful management:
This East Asian breed thrives in cooler climates where their thick undercoat provides comfort rather than burden.
Chow Chows need high-quality protein to maintain their muscular build and thick double coat.
My cinnamon Chow thrives on food formulated for non-sporting group breeds. Feed according to life stage – puppies require more calories for growth while seniors need less to prevent weight gain.
Key nutritional considerations:
Their blue-black lips and tongue require no special dietary considerations, but their food sensitivity does.
Scheduled meals work better than free feeding. Adult Chow Chows typically eat twice daily, while puppies need 3-4 smaller meals.
Measure portions carefully – their dignified, low-activity indoor behavior makes them prone to weight gain.
Elevated food bowls help prevent neck strain during meals, especially important for this square profile breed with their unique head structure.
Maintaining proper weight prevents stress on their straight hind legs and joints. An overweight Chow Chow faces increased risk of hip dysplasia and mobility issues.
Their thick mane can hide weight gain, so regular weight checks are essential.
Signs of healthy weight include:

Chow Chows come in rough and smooth coat varieties. The more common rough coat creates that distinctive lion dog appearance but requires significant maintenance.
Smooth coats need less grooming but still shed seasonally.
During coat-blowing season (typically spring and fall), daily brushing becomes essential.
Their seasonal shedding can be dramatic – prepare for tumbleweed-like fur collections throughout your home.
My grooming schedule includes:
Start grooming sessions early in their life. This stubborn demeanor breed tolerates grooming better when accustomed to it from puppyhood.
Their thick coat hides skin issues, making regular checks important. Check skin folds, especially around the face and tail base.
Their scowling expression creates facial folds prone to infection without proper care.
Red Chow Chows sometimes show more skin sensitivity than other colors.
All Chow Chows benefit from occasional coconut oil massages directly on the skin to maintain moisture and prevent hot spots common in this primitive spitz-type breed.
Early exposure shapes a Chow Chow’s future behavior. Start socialization immediately but control all interactions carefully. These blue-tongued dogs form quick opinions about new experiences.
Essential exposures during weeks 8-16:
Maintain positive associations through treats and praise. My cream Chow received treats from strangers, creating lasting positive impressions despite their natural wariness.
Continue exposures throughout adolescence and adulthood. The Songshi Quan’s reserved personality requires ongoing socialization to prevent excessive suspicion.
Weekly outings help maintain social skills for this aloof dog breed.
Keep interactions brief but positive. Their dignified demeanor means they tire of social situations quickly. Watch for subtle signs of stress – turning away, lip licking, or stiffening posture.
Veterinary visits need special attention. Practice handling similar to exam procedures at home. Their territorial guard dog instincts make unfamiliar handling stressful.
For dog-to-dog introductions:

The Chow Chow’s hunting breed history creates specific behavioral patterns. Resource guarding appears frequently, especially in dogs from the AKC non-sporting group with strong protective instincts.
Their cat-like temperament means they set boundaries clearly. Respect their space while establishing household rules consistently. They’re less forgiving of inconsistency than other breeds.
Typical issues include:
Establish clear expectations early. These strong-willed companions respect calm, confident leadership.
Prevent guarding by teaching “drop it” and “leave it” commands using positive methods.
Environmental management helps prevent problems:
Their minimal barking nature means when they do bark, it’s meaningful. Investigate causes rather than simply silencing them.
Redirect unwanted behaviors to appropriate alternatives. Their independent canine nature responds better to showing what they should do rather than punishing what they shouldn’t.
For serious issues like aggression or severe resource guarding, consult professionals experienced with this primitive spitz-type breed.
Their blue-black lips and scowling expression can hide subtle communication signals that experts recognize.

Chow Chows adapt well to various living spaces. Their low-activity indoor behavior makes them suitable for apartments despite their muscular build. They need:
My blue Chow gravitates to air conditioning vents during summer. Their thick double coat makes temperature management crucial for this heat-sensitive breed.
Secure your property thoroughly. The Chow Chow’s territorial guard dog nature means they may patrol boundaries and attempt escape if motivated.
Their independent canine personality makes reliable recall challenging.
Check for hazards specific to this breed:
Their strong jaws require durable toys and furnishings. The square profile breed can be surprisingly determined when motivated.
Plan carefully for travel with these East Asian origin dogs. Their dignified demeanor makes them poor candidates for extended car trips. Start with short journeys and gradually increase duration.
Essential travel gear includes:
Consider these options:
Avoid pet stores and online marketplaces. This ancient Chinese dog breed requires careful breeding to minimize health issues and temperament problems.
When evaluating puppies, observe their interaction with littermates. A properly socialized puppy shows curiosity without excessive fear or aggression.
Meet the parents if possible – their temperament often predicts the puppy’s future personality.
Look for health clearances including:
Prepare before arrival day. Their one-person dog tendency means they need time to bond with each family member. Create a quiet space with minimal disruption for the first few days.
For adult Chow Chows, understand their history may influence behavior. Dogs with minimal early socialization need patient, consistent training to overcome their natural wariness with strangers.
Their reserved with strangers nature can be managed but rarely eliminated completely.
Chow Chows can be loyal family guardians but aren’t ideal for homes with small children. Their dignified, aloof nature means they typically bond strongly with one person.
They’re territorial and protective of their chosen family members but need early socialization to manage their reserved temperament with strangers.
Extensive grooming is required, especially during coat-blowing season. The lion-like double coat needs daily brushing to prevent matting.
Rough coat varieties require more attention than smooth coat types. Regular care for skin folds helps prevent hot spots and infections. Their blue-black tongues need minimal special care.
Purebred Chow Chows commonly face:
Their squarish build and straight hind legs can lead to joint problems. Regular vet checkups are essential for this ancient Chinese breed with an 8-10 year lifespan.
No. Unlike many guard dogs, Chow Chows are quiet with minimal barking. These independent canines are more cat-like in their communication style.
They’ll alert you to genuine threats but aren’t noisy. Their scowling expression often communicates more than vocalizations.
Challenging. This strong-willed companion breed has an independent nature that can make training difficult.
Their stubborn demeanor requires consistent, positive reinforcement techniques. Short training sessions work best. They’re intelligent but not eager to please like some breeds, resembling their primitive spitz-type ancestors.
Moderate. Despite their muscular build, Chow Chows don’t require extensive exercise. A daily 30-minute walk suffices for most adults.
Their distinctive stilted gait and thick mane make them heat-sensitive, so avoid strenuous activity in warm weather. Mental stimulation is just as important as physical exercise.
Official colors include:
The AKC Non-sporting group standards recognize these five colors. Each requires specific coat care, with the blue Chow Chow being particularly striking. All varieties share the characteristic blue-black pigmentation of tongue, gums and lips.
No. Despite their thick coat, Chow Chows aren’t hypoallergenic. They’re heavy seasonal shedders during their “blowing coat” periods.
Their double-coated fur requires regular grooming to manage dander and loose hair. Air purifiers and frequent vacuuming help reduce allergens if you’re sensitive.
Purebred Chow Chow puppies from reputable breeders typically cost $1,000-$4,000. Show-quality dogs with superior bloodlines command premium prices.
Adoption from Chow Chow rescue organizations ranges from $300-$600. Remember that the Songshi Quan (Chinese name) requires significant ongoing expenses for grooming and healthcare.
Possible but challenging. Early socialization is crucial. Their East Asian origin as hunting companions means they have prey drive toward smaller animals.
They can be territorial with other dogs, especially same-sex ones. Proper introductions and supervision are essential. Many prefer being the only pet in the household.
The Chow Chow isn’t just a pet—it’s a commitment to a unique canine companion with a rich heritage.
Their distinctive scowling expression and teddy bear appearance hide a complex personality that rewards dedicated owners.
Bringing this ancient Chinese dog into your life means understanding:
These square-profile, muscular dogs with their distinctive blue-black lips require owners who appreciate their independent, one-person nature.
The reward? A loyal, dignified companion that connects deeply with their chosen humans while maintaining that fascinating aloof demeanor with others.
For the right owner, the Songshi Quan offers a special relationship unlike any other dog breed—combining the territorial guard dog instincts of their hunting breed history with surprisingly minimal barking and cat-like cleanliness.
