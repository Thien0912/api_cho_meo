The Domestic Longhair cat isn’t any one specific breed. Rather, it’s just the common name for a house cat with long hair. They come from mixed-breed ancestry; however, that doesn’t make them any less lovable. Domestic Longhairs are the United States’ second most popular cats, only behind their close cousins, Domestic Shorthair cats.
Height:
Up to 18 inches (body), up to 12 inches (tail)
Weight:
8 to 15 pounds
Lifespan:
Up to 20 years
Colors:
All color variants and patterns
Suitable for:
Loving cat families, those seeking companionship
Temperament:
Loyal, loving, intelligent, friendly, gets along with other cats
Domestic Longhair cats can make great mousers and have earned that accolade through centuries of proven worth. But they’re not all work and no play. You’ll shortly come to find that Domestic Longhairs can be loving and loyal companions.

Before you pick up a Domestic Longhair kitten, there are just a couple of things you should be aware of.
First, do not confuse the Domestic Longhair cat with the American Longhair. They are two entirely separate cats. The Domestic is a naturally occurring mixed breed that developed through many years of crossbreeding between different cat varieties. The American Longhair is considered to be a purebred cat stemming from the same line American Shorthairs are derived from.
Second, long-haired cats require much more work than short-haired varieties. Their coats will need some help staying well-groomed and clean. They are also much more likely to be heavy shedders. If you have any form of cat allergy, you should avoid long-haired cats.

Each Domestic Longhair cat has their very own unique personality. However, they’re generally mild-mannered felines. They don’t always need to be the center of attention, but they won’t remain hidden either. Some can be very affectionate and love nothing more than a good snuggle, while others may prefer to show their appreciation from the far end of the sofa.
One thing that they do share in common, though, is their ability and desire to hunt. They have a very high prey drive and the ability to put it to work.
Domestic Longhairs make for excellent family pets, especially with children who understand how to treat a cat. They can be very playful and will treat kids as playmates. However, you’ll still need to keep a close eye on them. Domestic Longhairs aren’t the biggest pets around and may be injured during roughhousing.
This all depends on the cat. They can have varying personalities that will determine their compatibility. Often, they do just fine around other cats and even dogs. The biggest issue is pairing them with smaller pets such as hamsters, lizards, or birds. Domestic Longhairs have an exceptionally high prey drive. Pairing them with “huntable” or “natural prey” pets is just an accident waiting to happen.

When it comes to caring for a Domestic Longhair, they’re relatively easy compared to other cats. But there are a few basics that you should know to ensure the best possible well-being for your feline friend.
Like all cats, the Domestic Longhair is an obligate carnivore. This means that they require meat and protein to survive. Carbohydrates, fruit, and veggies aren’t necessarily needed in their diets. So, you should opt for high-quality nutritious cat food to meet their nutrition requirements.
We recommend you take a look at our Vet’s Guide: Cat Food: Why It Pays to Get It Right so you have a clear understanding of the main differences between the huge variety of cat food options. You can also check our Vet-Approved Reviews on the Best Cat Food options guide and pick between some of the great options.
Just be sure not to overfeed your cat. They don’t need to eat as much as we do. Generally, having a clear understanding of how many calories a cat needs to maintain a healthy body condition score can help you know how many cups of your food of choice to feed per day.
Cats might seem like they don’t require as much exercise as other animals. They prefer to spend most of their days lounging about and catching some zzz’s. But that doesn’t mean they need to remain inactive. Your Domestic Longhair cat should remain active for at least 30 minutes a day.
This can best be accomplished through a couple of fun play sessions with them. Since they are smart and effective hunters, we recommend interactive toys that get them moving. Wand and feather toys do well along with laser pointers. These cats love to chase, hunt down, and kill the elusive red dot.
Many people believe that you can’t train a cat. That’s simply not true. You can train a cat to do tons of wonderful tricks, such as playing fetch, coming when called, walking on a leash, and even a couple of dog-like tricks, like rolling over or spinning!
Like other cats, Domestic Longhairs come pre-programmed with a sense of litter training. They are naturally very clean animals and instinctively bury their waste. All you need to reinforce is the location of their boxes and the proper places to relieve themselves.
This is the most complicated part of owning a long-haired cat. Although their coats can be luxurious and beautiful, they are going to require maintenance to keep them that way. Depending on your cat’s fur, we recommend daily to twice-weekly brushing to ensure their hair remains soft and unmatted. Also, it will help reduce unwanted shedding.
Domestic Longhairs are hardy and resilient cats that tend to enjoy good health. This is due to their mixed-breed heritage. They aren’t predisposed to particular health conditions. However, that doesn’t mean that they won’t experience any health issues—they’re just far less likely to than others.
The most common ailments your Domestic Longhair will face will be worms, fleas, allergies, and urinary tract infections. These are all conditions that are treatable and mostly preventable. The parasites can even be prevented through vet-prescribed medications and treatments.
There aren’t any real serious threats to your Domestic Longhair other than illnesses that reach across all breeds, such as cancer, diabetes, or infectious diseases like feline leukemia virus. Dental issues in cats are also common and preventable if you establish regular teeth cleaning from an early age.

The physical differences between males and females are very slight, except for reproductive anatomy. There is no real notable difference between size or weight. However, the same can’t be said about their behavior.
Males are often the most aggressive of the two especially when sexually mature and non-neutered. They’ll begin to mark their territory and spray urine around the house once they come of breeding age. Male cats are strongly recommended to be neutered as soon as possible to eliminate many of these behaviors. After neutering, males will become much more mild-mannered and loving.

Four possible mutations can produce long-haired coats in domestic cats, and all of these have been identified in the same gene. Three of the mutations are considered to be breed-specific, while the fourth is present in all long-haired cat breeds and crossbreeds. This is called M4 gene mutation.
While it may seem strange to have mixed breeds in a competition, this is a relatively common occurrence in the cat show world. Several major shows have “Household Pet” divisions where Domestic Longhairs and Shorthairs alike can compete. According to the Federation Internationale Feline, a Domestic Longhair may exhibit any eye color, all coat colors and patterns, any coat length or texture, and any length of tail.
Generally speaking, the Domestic Longhair is an excellent mouser. That skill proved exceptionally useful in the mid-1600s. At this time, the Black Death was sweeping across Europe spreading through disease-carrying fleas that lived on rats. Through their skills, the cats were able to cull the rodent population and help fight back against the plague. These mousing skills also earned them a place aboard seafaring vessels where they would hunt down stowaway rats and help fight off other rodent-borne diseases.
Perhaps the most famous Domestic Longhair was a London street cat named Humphrey. Found just outside of the British Prime Minister’s private estate at 10 Downing Street in 1988, this Domestic Longhair had an uncanny knack for mousing. By 1997, Humphrey had gained the official title of “Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office.” He was paid by the British government to the tune of £100 per year.

If you’re considering choosing a new cat for your home, a Domestic Longhair is excellent. They come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and personalities. So, there’s bound to be one that’s perfect for your home. If you require a great mouser, look no further than the Domestic Longhair, as many are top-notch mouse hunters.

Domestic long-haired cats encompass a diverse group of felines with a wide array of characteristics. Unlike specific breeds like domestic longhairs, they are a mix of different traits, resulting in variations in coat colors, patterns, and body types. These cats are renowned for their unique personalities, making them delightful companions for the right owner.
These charming cats can exhibit an assortment of coat colors such as black, white, gray, or even calico. Their coats may also feature various patterns including tabby stripes or tortoiseshell patches. In terms of body type, domestic long-haired cats can range from slender to more robust builds.
Despite being a blend of different breeds and traits, domestic long-haired cats share common attributes that make them beloved pets. They are known for their affectionate nature and adaptability to various living environments. They often display intelligence and playful behavior that endears them to their owners.
Their individual personalities add depth to the breed’s appeal; some may be outgoing and social while others might be more reserved but equally loving towards their human companions.
The history of domestic long-haired cats is not extensively documented due to their mixed lineage; however, it is believed that these felines descended from various long-haired cat breeds brought by early settlers. The intermingling of these breeds over time has contributed to the diversity seen in modern domestic long-haired cats.
Evidence suggests that the historical origins of these felines are intertwined with human migration and trade routes. As people traveled across continents carrying goods and seeking new opportunities, they likely brought along their furry companions—contributing to the dispersion and mingling of different cat breeds.
Historical records provide glimpses into the presence of long-haired cats in various cultures throughout history—a testament to their enduring popularity among humans across different societies.
Caring for a domestic long-haired cat involves understanding its distinctive needs arising from its varied genetic background:
Domestic long-haired cats are known for their medium to long fur that comes in various textures and thicknesses. This breed showcases a wide array of colors and patterns, such as tabby, solid, and bi-color. Their eyes are strikingly expressive, with hues ranging from green, gold, blue to copper. These felines possess sturdy, muscular bodies with a graceful and elegant appearance. Notably, they often have long tufts of fur on their ears and fluffy tails.
The variety in fur texture can range from silky smooth to dense undercoat with longer guard hairs on top. For instance, some domestic long-haired cats may have softer coats that require less grooming while others might have thicker fur demanding more frequent brushing sessions.
These cats’ physical features contribute to their unique charm and appeal as pets. Their distinctive looks make them stand out among other breeds.
Given their mixed heritage, domestic long-haired cats exhibit a diverse range of temperaments. They are commonly described as affectionate creatures who enjoy spending time around family members but also value their independence.
One remarkable trait about these felines is their adaptability; they tend to adjust well to different living situations including changes in routines or new environments.
Their intelligence allows them to engage in interactive playtime activities which help keep them mentally stimulated while forming strong bonds with their owners along the way. Understanding an individual cat’s personality is crucial for providing proper care tailored specifically for its needs.
Domestic long-haired cats are diverse in their social preferences. Some enjoy the company of people and other pets, while others prefer solitude. They may express affection through gentle headbutts, purring, or kneading. By providing opportunities for social interaction, such as interactive play sessions or designated cuddle time, you can help them thrive mentally and emotionally.
Respecting their boundaries is crucial; allow them to initiate interactions instead of forcing attention on them. This approach fosters a sense of trust and comfort in their environment. It’s essential to create a safe space where they feel secure when seeking out social interactions.
Understanding each cat’s unique personality is vital; some might be more outgoing and seek constant attention, while others may only desire occasional companionship. Observing their body language can provide valuable insight into whether they’re receptive to socializing at any given moment.
Domestic long-haired cats often exhibit various behaviors, including hunting instincts, territorial marking, playfulness, curiosity, and the search for cozy spots for relaxation. Understanding these natural behaviors is pivotal in creating an enriching environment that meets their needs.
Their hunting instincts may manifest through playful behavior with toys or stalking movements during playtime. Providing interactive toys that mimic prey can satisfy this instinctual behavior positively without causing harm to wildlife.
Territorial marking is another common behavior seen in domestic long-haired cats. They might rub against furniture or vertically scratch objects to mark their territory with scent glands located on their cheeks and paws. Offering appropriate scratching posts can redirect this behavior away from household items.
Some domestic long-haired cats are particularly vocal compared to others – expressing themselves through meows or chirps more frequently. Acknowledging these vocalizations by responding appropriately helps strengthen your bond with them while addressing any underlying needs they might have.
Employing positive reinforcement techniques when addressing unwanted behaviors is highly effective for domestic long-haired cats due to their sensitivity towards punishment-based methods.
Regular grooming is crucial for maintaining the long fur of domestic long-haired cats. Brushing their coat not only prevents matting and tangles but also helps distribute natural oils, reducing shedding around the home. When grooming, pay special attention to sensitive areas such as the belly and armpits to ensure thorough care. Occasional bathing using cat-friendly products can help maintain the health of their coat. Professional grooming services can be sought to keep their coats in top condition.
Grooming these cats involves regular brushing to prevent matting and tangles while distributing natural oils and reducing shedding. For example, a weekly brushing session can effectively maintain their coat’s health by preventing mats from forming.
Trimming nails regularly is essential for preventing overgrowth that could cause discomfort to domestic long-haired cats. Providing appropriate scratching posts can help naturally maintain nail health while also fulfilling their instinctual behavior needs. In addition to nail care, dental hygiene is equally important for these cats’ overall well-being; consider providing dental treats or engaging in regular brushing routines to support oral health. Given that they may be prone to dental issues, monitoring dental health is crucial for this breed.
Ensuring proper nail care includes trimming them regularly so they don’t become overgrown or cause discomfort for the cat. Moreover, providing suitable scratching posts allows them to fulfill their instinctual need while keeping their nails healthy.
Domestic long-haired cats, due to their mixed ancestry, may be prone to certain health issues. It’s important to watch out for potential genetic conditions such as heart disease or joint problems. Regular visits to the vet are crucial for monitoring any developing health problems. Maintaining a balanced diet is essential in supporting overall health and reducing the risk of certain conditions. Being aware of breed-specific conditions is vital for early detection and treatment.
Regular grooming plays a significant role in keeping an eye on your domestic long-haired cat’s overall well-being. During grooming sessions, it’s advisable to check for any signs of skin abnormalities or lumps that could indicate underlying health issues. By staying vigilant during these sessions, you can detect potential problems early and seek veterinary care promptly.
Another way to ensure your domestic long-haired cat stays healthy is by providing them with regular exercise and mental stimulation. Engaging them in playtime activities using toys or interactive games not only keeps them physically active but also stimulates their minds, contributing positively to their overall well-being.
The lifespan of domestic long-haired cats varies; however, they generally live between 10 to 15 years with proper care and attention. Providing a nutritious diet tailored to their specific needs goes a long way in ensuring they lead healthy lives.
Weight management also plays a crucial role in preventing injuries related to obesity which can significantly impact the quality of life for your furry companion. Monitoring their weight through dietary control and regular exercise helps prevent obesity-related health issues that may arise over time.
Spaying or neutering at the appropriate age contributes significantly not only towards population control but also toward the overall health of your pet. This procedure reduces the risk of certain reproductive system-related cancers while curbing behavioral concerns associated with mating behaviors.
Quality veterinary care is paramount. From routine vaccinations and preventive medications against parasites like fleas and ticks, veterinarians play an essential role in safeguarding your pet from various health problems.
Domestic long-haired cats require a balanced diet that includes high-quality protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water to support their overall health. It’s essential to provide both wet and dry food options to ensure they receive the necessary nutrients. Portion control is crucial for weight management; overfeeding should be avoided. Any dietary adjustments based on age or specific health needs should be discussed with a veterinarian.
Fresh water should always be available as it supports hydration, which is vital for the well-being of domestic long-haired cats. Ensuring access to clean water helps prevent dehydration and supports various bodily functions.
When considering the nutritional needs of domestic long-haired cats, it’s important to remember that their diet plays a significant role in maintaining their overall health and well-being.
Monitoring portion sizes is critical in preventing obesity among domestic long-haired cats. Overfeeding can lead to excessive weight gain and related health issues. Regular exercise through interactive playtime activities can help manage their weight effectively.
Consulting with a veterinarian about appropriate dietary choices that support weight management goals is highly recommended. This ensures that the cat’s nutritional needs are met while managing its weight effectively.
Avoiding overindulgence with treats is also crucial when aiming for effective weight management in domestic long-haired cats. Opting for healthy alternatives when rewarding good behavior helps maintain an ideal body condition score and contributes to their overall well-being.
Introducing kittens to the litter box early on is crucial for domestic long-haired cats. Use unscented litter that’s easily accessible to encourage them to use it. Keeping the litter box clean by scooping waste daily and changing the litter periodically is essential for maintaining their hygiene. If you have multiple cats, providing one litter box per cat plus an extra one is recommended to prevent territorial issues and promote proper usage.
Address any aversion to the litter box promptly by identifying potential triggers such as stress or medical issues. For instance, if your cat suddenly starts avoiding the litter box, it may be a sign of an underlying health problem. Positive reinforcement through treats or praise can encourage consistent litter box usage.
When training domestic long-haired cats, positive reinforcement techniques like clicker training can effectively modify behaviors. Consistency plays a vital role in establishing boundaries and teaching new behaviors during training sessions with these cats.
Understanding that each cat has its own learning pace is crucial; patience is essential during training efforts. It’s important not to rush or force them into learning something new before they are ready.
If you encounter challenging behavioral issues beyond your expertise, seek professional guidance from a veterinarian or animal behaviorist who specializes in working with cats.
Reward-based training fosters trust between you and your cat while encouraging desirable behaviors such as using scratching posts instead of furniture for claw maintenance.
Creating a calm environment is crucial for fostering positive interactions between domestic long-haired cats and humans. It’s essential to respect your cat’s cues for interaction, offering space when needed while providing affection when welcomed. Educating children on how to gently interact with these felines is vital, and supervision during interactions, especially with younger children, is advisable.
Educating visitors about your cat’s preferences regarding interaction can help minimize stress for your pet. Understanding feline body language aids in interpreting their comfort level during human interactions. Paying attention to subtle signs such as ear positioning or tail movements can provide valuable insights into your cat’s feelings and comfort levels.
When introducing new pets to the household, it’s important to do so gradually. Allowing domestic long-haired cats time to adjust without feeling overwhelmed is key to a successful introduction process. Supervising initial interactions between your cat and other pets and providing separate spaces initially may help ease the introduction process.
Respecting your cat’s need for personal space even after successful introductions is essential in maintaining harmonious relationships among pets within the household. Positive experiences through controlled interactions foster healthy relationships among pets over time.
Seeking professional advice if encountering challenges during pet introductions can be extremely beneficial in addressing any issues that may arise during this adjustment period.
Engage your domestic long-haired cat in interactive play using toys that mimic prey-like movements. Toys like feather wands, laser pointers, or small stuffed animals can simulate the thrill of hunting for these natural predators. Rotate toys regularly to keep playtime engaging; this prevents boredom from setting in and maintains their interest.
Encourage physical activity through climbing structures or puzzle feeders that stimulate their natural instincts. Providing a variety of options for them to explore and conquer helps satisfy their need for adventure and keeps them physically active. Daily play sessions provide mental stimulation while strengthening the bond between you and your cat, creating a positive environment for both of you.
Tailor playtime activities based on your cat’s energy levels and preferences. Some cats may prefer high-energy games with lots of movement, while others might enjoy more low-key activities such as batting at a toy mouse or chasing after rolling balls. Understanding your feline friend’s individual needs is crucial in ensuring they get the exercise they require.
Environmental enrichment plays a vital role in keeping domestic long-haired cats mentally stimulated. Vertical spaces or window perches offer great opportunities for exploration, allowing them to observe their surroundings from different vantage points. This not only engages their minds but also provides entertainment.
Puzzle toys or treat-dispensing devices encourage problem-solving skills while keeping them mentally engaged. These types of toys help prevent boredom-related behaviors by challenging their intellects and providing rewards when they successfully complete tasks.
Interactive games like hide-and-seek or treasure hunts tap into their natural hunting instincts, providing mental stimulation while nurturing their innate behaviors. Rotating toys regularly prevents monotony; introducing new stimuli keeps them mentally sharp and curious about exploring new challenges.
Mental stimulation contributes to overall well-being by preventing boredom-related behaviors such as excessive grooming, aggression towards other pets, or destructive tendencies within the home environment.
When considering adopting a domestic long-haired kitten, it’s essential to factor in aspects such as temperament, energy levels, and grooming needs. Spend time interacting with potential kittens to assess their compatibility with your lifestyle. Inquire about the kitten’s background, including its health history from breeders or shelters. Ensure that the kittens have received all necessary vaccinations before bringing them home. It is crucial to conduct thorough research when seeking out reputable breeders or shelters.
Before choosing an adult cat, consider factors like temperament, energy levels, and grooming needs. Spend time interacting with potential cats to gauge compatibility with your lifestyle. Ask for information about the cat’s background and ensure they have received necessary vaccinations before adoption.
Early veterinary visits are vital for kittens to receive vaccinations, deworming treatments, flea prevention measures, etc. Establish routines for feeding schedules and grooming sessions early on in their lives. Gradually socialize kittens by exposing them to various environments under controlled circumstances while monitoring their growth milestones closely during the first year of life.
It’s important to provide safe spaces within your home where kittens can explore freely without any hazards present. These spaces should be equipped with toys and scratching posts suitable for their age group.
When bringing a domestic long-haired kitten into your home, it’s crucial to educate all family members about proper handling techniques. Assign age-appropriate responsibilities related to caring for the kitten within the household, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and care.
Create designated safe zones where kittens can retreat if feeling overwhelmed. This could be a cozy corner with their bed or a quiet room where they can relax away from the hustle and bustle of family life. Supervise interactions between young children and kittens, ensuring gentle handling at all times.
Encourage bonding activities among family members that foster strong connections with the kitten. Engaging in playtime, grooming sessions, or feeding together helps build trust and affection between the kitten and every member of the household.
Domestic long-haired cats have made a significant impact in pop culture, with many famous feline personalities leaving their mark. For example, the character of Mrs. Norris in J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series is based on a domestic long-haired cat. Internet sensation Grumpy Cat was also a domestic longhair known for her unique appearance and memorable memes.
These cats are not only celebrated for their appearances in literature and movies but also for real-life heroic acts within communities. For instance, Scarlett, a brave domestic long-haired cat from Brooklyn, New York, saved her kittens from a fire at the risk of severe burns herself. These stories highlight the diverse and remarkable contributions of this breed to popular culture.
Staying updated on media platforms can provide valuable insights into caring for domestic long-haired cats.

Feb 7, 2024
The Domestic Longhair cat, with its luxurious coat and often captivating charm, stands as a quintessential icon of feline beauty and companionship. As one of the most prevalent types of cats worldwide, the Domestic Longhair embodies a rich tapestry of traits that have endeared it to cat lovers for generations.
With origins tracing back to various mixed-breed cats, the Domestic Longhair showcases a captivating diversity of colors, patterns, and personalities. Beyond its stunning appearance, the Longhair boasts a gentle and affectionate nature, often fostering deep bonds with human companions. Whether curled up on a sunlit windowsill or engaging in playful antics, these delightful fit in well in households around the world, earning their place as cherished members of the family.
Curious as a cat about Domestic Longhairs? This guide is here to help!
Although the Domestic Longhair is often referred to as a type of cat breed, the truth is that it's not specific breed, but a term used to describe a group of cats with long fur. These cats don't belong to any particular cat breed (unlike, say, the Persian cat, which is an established long-haired cat breed). Kittens and cats of unknown lineage are commonly referred to as Domestic cats or Mixed Breed, further refined into categories based on length of fur: Domestic Short Hairs, Domestic Medium Hairs, and Domestic Long Hairs.
As a result, Domestic Longhair cats come in a wide variety of colors and coat patterns, not to mention different temperaments thanks to their diverse genetics. That said, they are often said to be highly friendly and affectionate toward humans. They are also common in many parts of the world, making them popular pets for individuals and families alike.

The Domestic Longhair cat, or "DLH" as some say, is a type of domestic cat distinguished by its long, flowing coat and varied genetic background. Unlike specific purebred breeds, Domestic Longhairs do not adhere to strict standards of appearance or lineage. Instead, they encompass a wide spectrum of physical traits, colors, patterns, and personalities, reflecting their mixed ancestry. As mentioned earlier, these impressive cats can have fur ranging from semi-long to extremely fluffy, which requires regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling. In addition to having incredibly diverse coat colors and patterns, Domestic Longhairs can also exhibit a variety of eye colors, adding to their unique appearance.
Fascinatingly, Domestic Longhair coat coloring and look trend toward the most common coloring and body style of other pedigreed cats in their geographical area. For example, Domestic cats in Asia quite often have Siamese coloring. In contrast, Domestics in the United States and the United Kingdom have a larger, sturdier body like the popular Shorthairs.
Due to their mixed heritage, Domestic Longhairs tend to be relatively healthy and resilient cats, although they may still be susceptible to common feline health issues. With proper care, nutrition, and regular veterinary check-ups, they can live long and fulfilling lives with a loving human family.
Wondering if you'd mesh well with a Domestic Longhair for a fur-friend? In terms of temperament, Domestic Longhair cats are known for their adaptability and versatility. They often display characteristics commonly associated with other friendly cat breeds, such as independence, curiosity, and intelligence. However, their individual personalities can vary widely, ranging from outgoing and sociable to reserved and introspective. These cats are true individuals, with their personalities depending on their genetics and learning experiences. You’ll find all “types” of these mixed breeds, which means there’s a kitty for everyone!
They’re often the first cat for many owners, due to their prevalence in shelters and rescues. When choosing a Domestic kitten or adult cat, make sure to look for a companion that fits in with your lifestyle.
Domestic Long Hair cats have varied lifestyle preferences. Some are content to lounge around with their human guardians with occasional short play sessions, some are independent and self-entertaining, and others are highly active, intelligent, and require constant physical and mental stimulation.
If you have a particular lifestyle you’d like to share with your furry friend, consider adopting an adult cat. Since they’ve already grown into their personalities, you can get a better sense of the lifestyle they’ll need. Kittens (as a general guideline) tend to be active and playful but may mellow out or maintain their energy level as they get older. You never know what you’re going to end up with when you bring home a kitten! That’s part of the fun.
The Domestic Long Hair cat can be found all over the world. Throughout history, they’ve acted as workers and companions to their families. Arriving in America aboard the ships of the early settlers, including the Mayflower, these cats played an essential role in the new world. They may have started out keeping rodents at bay for pioneers and shopkeepers but soon became a popular family pet.
According to the American Veterinary Medical Association’s report in 2022, over 29% of American households include a cat. The Domestic Long Hair cat will no doubt continue to thrive as an important part of cat culture.

In order to provide your Domestic Longhair with the best life possible, it's important to understand their needs. While training is typically more associated with dogs, cats still need mental enrichment and exercise.
The Domestic Longhair cat needs enough exercise to stay healthy and trim, as well as preventing unwanted behavior problems. Provide them with sufficient playtime, areas to climb, and encourage them to follow you around the house (or leash train them for outside walks) to get their steps in every day.
All cats require mental enrichment to keep their minds sharp and active. Boredom can cause stress, which results in behavior issues. To keep your kitten or adult cat from getting bored, make sure you provide them with plenty of toys, rotated regularly, to keep them novel and exciting; plenty of perching places to climb and explore; cozy nooks in which to take naps; windows from which to watch wildlife; play (using an interactive wand toy) providing an outlet for their instinctive predatory behaviors; and puzzle-solving opportunities (such as food puzzles). Depending on how inquisitive, motivated, and intelligent your cat is, you might also consider clicker-training tricks and commands.
While many Domestic Longhair cats don’t exhibit behavior issues, they can crop up if cat guardians aren’t meeting the needs of their cat. Most common are house-soiling (especially if appropriate litter box setups are not provided and maintained); inter-cat aggression (if a slow-introduction process is not followed); and destructive behavior such as scratching furniture, knocking over objects, and counter-surfing (particularly if ways to alleviate boredom are not provided).
The potential for encountering these problems can be minimized or avoided by making sure your cats’ needs are being met. This means an appropriately clean place for elimination, territorial security, mental and physical exercise, and social interaction.
Cats are also known to exhibit behavioral issues or changes if they’re experiencing pain, discomfort, or medical problems. So, it’s important to manage your kitty’s health with regular visits to the veterinarian.
Depending on your cat’s personality, they may get along well (or not) with other kittens, adult cats, household pets, and people. It’s always best to introduce your cat to a potential new friend slowly, giving them a choice whether to interact, and providing positive reinforcement for positive interactions.
Take particular care when introducing cats to each other, as most cats require time to get to know a new feline companion. Rushing introductions can result in fighting or injuries, undesirable behaviors (such as house-soiling), and stress for both humans and animals.
Domestic Longhairs have a wide variety of preferences when it comes to fun activities. If your cat shows signs of fear, stress, or anxiety, discontinue the activity; start small, and encourage the exploration of new objects and activities using positive reinforcement (treats, petting, praise, play, etc. — anything your cat enjoys). Have fun together while you try new things!
Never leave your cat alone near an open window that doesn't have a secure screen. If it's on the first floor, your cat can get out of the house and get injured, lost or any of the other possible problems that outdoor cats face on a daily basis. If the window is on the second floor or above your cat is at risk of suffering from severe injuries of "high-rise syndrome," and you don't even need to live in a true high-rise building. The injuries of "high-rise syndrome" tend to be worst in falls from between the 2nd and 7th floors!
The Domestic Longhair cat has a thick, double coat of fur that is generally two inches long or more.
All Domestic cats need regular maintenance to keep their coats healthy. Longhairs especially need weekly brushing (more during seasonal shedding periods). This helps prevent matting and furballs that can creep up quickly in a long coat. While most are quite capable of keeping themselves clean, sometimes a bath is in order. Like all cats, the Domestic Longhair requires regular nail trimming and teeth brushing to stay happy and healthy.

Domestic Longhair cats have made their mark in various aspects of pop culture, often celebrated for their beauty, charm, and sometimes mysterious allure.

The Domestic Longhair is a cat with mysterious origins. For one thing, they’re actually not a specific breed like the American Longhair, which has a pedigree with a traceable background.
Rather, Domestic Longhairs refer to cats that are similar in size to Domestic Shorthairs but have one or both parents that have the longhaired gene. Due to their mixed ancestry, these felines can vary in color, markings, and size.
Height:
9–16 inches
Weight:
8–15 pounds
Lifespan:
9–15 years
Colors:
White, black, gray, tortoiseshell, tabby, orange
Suitable for:
Apartment dwellers, small families, children, people with no other pets
Temperament:
Playful, good with children, curious, shy toward strangers
Domestic Longhairs are adorable and have luxurious coats and wonderful personalities that match their beautiful appearance. We’re always excited about the idea of a kitty finding a new home. So if you’ve acquired a Domestic Longhair, read on for a comprehensive overview of this special cat to help you provide the best care that you can for them.

The Domestic Longhairs is a popular cat. Fortunately, they are common, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find one. Always make sure you do your research about the breed and where to buy or adopt one. Make sure that your kitten is healthy and that you have enough time and energy to care for them.
Their temperament and traits can vary from each other. Generally, these cats tend to be playful and curious. They are a great fit for families or people living in apartments. Take a look at what type of care Domestic Longhairs need in terms of diet, grooming, and exercise.

Since Domestic Longhairs have mixed ancestry, they don’t have a predictable temperament like purebred cats do. However, many cat owners have noted that their Domestic Longhairs are playful and curious, just like their predecessors that used to be mousers in Europe.
These cats’ personalities usually land between aloof and needy. They’re independent, so they can be left home alone without feeling much separation anxiety. However, they also form strong bonds with their families and can be sweet companions.
Domestic Longhairs tend to have patience with young children and can also have a playful side to them. When properly socialized, they can become great playmates for children.
The best way to socialize this cat is to work on it when they’re a young kitten. Kittens will have an easier time learning and getting used to being handled.
When you first bring home a Domestic Longhair, make sure to supervise all interactions the cat has with your kids. Children should also learn how to respectfully handle cats, such as not poking them or trying to touch their faces.
Domestic Longhairs typically don’t do well with other pets. They tend to be solitary and don’t like being around dogs. These cats like to observe from perches, so they won’t want to interact with a loud or energetic pup.
They also tend to be territorial, so they typically don’t do well in a house with too many cats. Sometimes, though, you can bring home a bonded pair, which are sets of kittens that grew up together and formed an attachment to each other.
Since many Domestic Longhairs were bred as mousers, they also can’t be fully trusted with small pets. Their prey drive can kick in at unpredictable moments, so they should never be left alone with other small pets, especially rodents.
Overall, this cat will do best in a home where they’re the only pet. You can try to socialize them to live with other cats, and you’ll have the most success if socialization starts when they’re a kitten.

Domestic Longhairs are generally fairly easy cats to care for and don’t typically have any severe health conditions. So, they’re great for first-time owners. Here’s a breakdown of their basic care needs.
Cats are obligate carnivores, so they thrive on high-protein diets. Your pet  should have a diet consisting of at least 25% protein. Indoor cats and those that have been spayed or neutered are especially susceptible to becoming overweight and obese.
So, if you have an indoor Domestic Longhair, it’s important to make sure that they’re on a low-carb diet. You can work with your veterinarian to figure out the right brand of cat food and the correct amount of food that your cat should eat every day.
Domestic Longhairs don’t tend to have food allergies, so it’s safe for them to eat most kinds of cat food. Cats will display some or all of the following signs if they have a food allergy:
Domestic Longhairs tend to be active and playful cats with a strong prey drive. They’ll need plenty of play and exercise to prevent them from experiencing boredom that can eventually lead to destructive behaviors.
You can promote healthy exercise by supplying toys that your cat can chase around, such as an automatic cat toy or cat wand. You can also install cat trees and perches around the house to encourage your pet to jump, leap, and perch from platform to platform.
If you have an enclosed backyard, you can let your cat out to explore. Just make sure your fences are over 6 feet tall or have fence rollers or other safety measures in place to prevent your pet from escaping. Domestic Longhairs can be extremely agile and smart escape artists, so it’s imperative to watch for any escape attempts.
In general, cats don’t typically learn training as dogs do. They can be independent and not learn or take to listening to verbal commands. You may be able to use treats as positive reinforcement whenever your cat exhibits good behavior, such as using the litter box. However, your Domestic Longhair most likely won’t learn any tricks that you can use on command.
The coats of Domestic Longhair will vary depending on the cat’s history. However, most owners can expect to spend at least several days a week brushing their pet’s hair. These cats will groom themselves, but if they have particularly long coats, their hair can tangle and become matted. So, they’ll need help with maintenance. This breed will benefit from slicker brushes and combs that can get past their long fur and thoroughly brush their coat.
Since Domestic Longhairs don’t have a specific lineage from purebred cats, they don’t have any unique health conditions. However, they can develop common health issues as they age, so it’s important to stay on top of routine checkups.
There aren’t any definitive distinguishable traits between male and female Domestic Shorthairs. Temperament will vary depending on the cat’s unique ancestry and home environment.
However, spaying and neutering can affect a cat’s behavior. For example, neutered cats are less likely to do urine marking, and spayed cats won’t be as active as their unspayed counterparts. Spayed and neutered cats may also not be as territorial, so they may have an easier time learning to live with other cats.

It’s rarer to find a longhaired cat than a shorthaired cat because long hair is a recessive trait. For a cat to receive recognition as longhaired, their coat must be at least 2 inches long.
Humphrey was a Domestic Longhair that was found as a stray near the official residence of the British Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street. He was adopted and employed as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office and lived in 10 Downing Street from 1989 to 1997.
Humphrey’s employment started a long tradition of cats living as Chief Mousers in the Prime Minister’s home. Today, the Chief Mouser in residence is Larry the Tabby.
During the 1600s when the plague was rampant, Domestic Longhairs were used to catch rats. Many rats carried infected fleas that would spread the plague, and people bred more Domestic Longhairs to hunt them.
Settlers and travelers eventually brought these cats aboard ships sailing to America, and they became just as popular in new lands.

Domestic Longhairs have been co-existing and living harmoniously with humans for centuries. They’re independent yet affectionate, making them great companions built to survive. These cats will do well in homes with no other pets, but they should have plenty of playtime moments, toys, and fixtures that help them exercise their prey drive.
Bringing home a Domestic Longhair can be unpredictable. Still, as you learn and get used to their unique temperament and personality, you’ll be sure to find a loving companion that shows you love and affection in their own special way.

It is no wonder the domestic longhair cats are so popular. If they are properly groomed and brushed, their coat is a beautiful sight to see. For many people the longhaired cat is the most beautiful of cats.
Usually domestic medium hair cat is grouped under long haired cats – it has a fluffy coat which is slightly shorter than that of the longhaired cats.
The first Angora cats appeared in Europe in the 16th Century, but longhaired cats were probably in existence even before that. After all – the Romans who ruled most of Europe, had a state that expanded to areas far away where longhaired cats are known to have developed. With their liking of luxuries it is not far-fetched to assume they might have carried these beauties with them to Europe.
From Europe the long haired cats came to America in the ships of the pilgrims – to help fight the rodent problem. There is also a story that tells how Marie Antoinette sent her beloved
Turkish Angoras to safety to the New World in the very same ship that was meant for her own escape. So who knows – maybe the longhairs now in the States carry the genes of Marie Antoinettes cats…
The domestic longhair, just like the domestic shorthair, is a cat of mixed ancestry. The long hair gene is recessive, and this means that to be long haired, the cat must get the long hair gene from both its parents.
In all probability long hair was a gene mutation in Asia Minor or Russia / Siberia (or both – both areas where a warmer, longer coat would be good protection against a colder climate. Other typical changes in animals of colder climates that also appear in these long-haired cats are the heavier body and dense undercoat (but not always: the lovely Turkish Angora has no undercoat) and coarser hair (again: not the case with Turkish Angora). Also the fact that the paws have no longer hair speaks in favor of the long hair gene being an adaptation to colder climate. Animals living in hotter desert conditions may have hair in their paws as protection against the hot ground.

The longhair domestic cat can be of any color or pattern. But to keep this coat beautiful it needs to be groomed daily by the cat’s owner. This kind of fur can become very easily matted, so daily brushing and combing with a de-matting comb is required. It is also preferable to wash the cat every few weeks. This is easier if the cat is taught to be washed from an early age. (If you try to teach an adult cat to be washed, be prepared for some wet and scratchy moments… If this proves to be completely impossible, at least stick to the brushing and combing routine)
And please – if the coat is badly matted, do not use scissors to cut it. It is very easy to cut the skin of the cat. Take the cat to a professional groomer of vet if the situation is bad. They have the means to remove the matted hair safely.
Did you know that cat hair is collected in many places to make pillows, scarves and clothes? One reason is that it is believed that cat hair alleviates the symptoms of rheumatism.
The domestic longhair cats are beautiful, but because of the grooming and house cleaning needs this is not a lazy owner’s cat.
I have seen domestic longhair cats in real life that lived in a household where no one wanted to brush them. You can guess how much hair was brushed out of them by a visitor who could not look at the situation any more... Poor cats seemed to lose half their weight, when the hairballs where brushed out… It must have hurt but they just purred, knowing someone was doing them a big favor.
Also if you are planning to let your cat roam freely outdoors, do think twice. Domestic longhair cats are best kept indoors, because if let out, their coat gets matted and dirty fast. And if this happens, they may get stuck in bushes and other places and hurt themselves trying to tear themselves free. If in this process they cut themselves, the matted fur probably is full of bacteria which may cause bad infections.
Because of its genetic diversity the longhair domestic cat is usually quite healthy. You can expect to have this feline friend around 12-20 years (if kept indoors – outdoor cats live about one third of this).
Because of its ancestry the personalities of domestic longhairs can vary greatly, but for the most part they are kind and affectionate family cats.

This book travels with the King Tut - Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh exhibition on his world tour of ten cities from March 2018 onwards
Tutankhamun: In My Own Hieroglyphs tells the story, for older children, of the life and afterlife of the famous young pharaoh in his own words. Tutankhamun tells us about the trouble he got into as a child in Akhenaten's palace in the new city of Akhetaten, and how he became a boy pharaoh. As we learn, his life changed a lot when he died as a teenager, and long years of boredom started in his tomb with only his pet monkey Fingers and his treasure for company. He did meet some of the Egyptian gods, of course, and had fun scaring off tomb robbers, but it was mostly rather dull. Then one day, some new and strange people, including a Mr. Howard Carter, arrived and began to take all the treasures out of his royal tomb. Fortunately, through the eyes of his beautiful golden mask, Tutankhamun, could have fun again traveling around the world
An ancient friend of mine, Mr Mummific dictated a book about how he became a mummy - and I was his scribe and artist. The book is available at Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk
On my other website www.ancientagypt101.com he continues his stories about life in ancient Egypt.
Another hilarious adventure for children with Mr Mummific, the mummy with attitude. He now tells the story of his mishaps, misunderstandings and misadventures as he leaves his tomb through the False Door to embark on the complicated and dangerous journey to the Afterlife aboard the magnificent Ship of Millions.
Find the book at Amazon.com  and Amazon.co.uk
The first book in an epic fantasy series based on human mythology. The search for the mythical Watchers, the angels who fathered the Nephilim, the half-angels. A story that moves on three levels - our times, ancient Greece and ancient Egypt.
