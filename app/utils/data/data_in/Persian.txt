The Persian cat, with their luxurious long fur and distinctive appearance, is a breed known for elegance and a regal demeanor. Originating in Persia (modern-day Iran), these cats have a distinctive round face, flat nose, and large, expressive eyes. Persian cats come in a variety of coat colors and patterns, showcasing their beauty and versatility. Despite their aristocratic appearance, Persians are known for their calm and gentle nature, making them well-suited for indoor living. They are highly affectionate and are happy to enjoy the day lounging around the house, snuggling up alongside their human companions. Regular grooming is essential to maintain their long, flowing coat and prevent matting. With their serene disposition and stunning aesthetics, Persian cats are a popular choice among cat enthusiasts worldwide.
When considering a Persian cat, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a cat in need. However, if you decide to purchase a Persian kitten, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their cats. Reputable Persian breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their cats, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the kitties. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy kitty while discouraging unethical breeding practices.
Some cat breeds are typically independent and aloof, even if they’ve been raised by the same person since kittenhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn’t the only factor that goes into affection levels; cats who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.

Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems. This doesn’t mean that every cat of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they’re at an increased risk. If you’re looking only for purebred cats or kittens, it’s a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you’re interested in.

Some cats are perpetual kittens—full of energy and mischief—while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful kitten sounds endearing, consider how many games of chase the mouse-toy you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other animals who can stand in as playmates. A classic wand cat toy like this one is perfect for playful felines!

Some breeds sound off more often than others with meows, yowls, and chattering. When choosing a breed, think about how the cat vocalizes and how often. If constant “conversation” drives you crazy, consider a kitty less likely to chat.

Being tolerant of children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a nonchalant attitude toward running, screaming youngsters are all traits that make a kid-friendly cat. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual cat will behave; cats from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences and personality.

Stranger-friendly cats will greet guests with a curious glance or a playful approach; others are shy or indifferent, perhaps even hiding under furniture or skedaddling to another room. However, no matter what the breed, a cat who was exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a kitten will respond better to strangers as an adult.

The Persian is an old breed. To those who love this elegant cat, it will come as no surprise that the long-haired beauty originated in the cradle of civilization: Mesopotamia, which was later known as Persia and is now modern-day Iran.
The breed’s long hair was probably the result of a natural mutation, and its striking appearance attracted the attention of 17th-century Italian nobleman and world traveler Pietro Della Valle, who is credited with bringing the first longhaired cats to Europe in 1626. At that time, the cats had shiny, silky gray fur, but thanks to selective breeding Persians are now found in a kaleidoscope of colors, including bi-color (a color plus white).
Until the late 19th century, when breeding and showing cats became popular, long-haired cats from Persia, Turkey, Afghanistan and other exotic locales were known simply as “Asiatic” cats and were often bred together. At the Crystal Palace cat show in 1871, Persian-type cats were among the breeds exhibited. They were popular pets of the time and had a special cachet because of Queen Victoria’s fondness for the breed. Even in the Victoria era, association with a “celebrity” ensured an animal’s desirability.
Through selective breeding, cat fanciers began to mold the Persian to its present-day appearance. They bred cats to have a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, small, rounded ears, big eyes, and a sturdy body. Their fur was longer than that of the Angora cat, and they had shorter legs.
Soon, the Persians surpassed the Angoras in popularity. In the United States, where they were first imported in the late 19th century, they also became favorites, edging out the longhaired Maine Coon cat, which had once held pride of place as an American sweetheart. In the little more than a century since, the Persian has become the most beloved cat breed in the world, prized for its beautiful appearance and sweet personality.
This is a medium-size cat. Persians usually have a weight range of 7 to 12 pounds.
The dignified and docile Persian is known for being quiet and sweet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap—surely her rightful place—being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy, then serve her tea at their parties.
Persians are affectionate but discriminating. They reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust. Loud environments aren’t a Persian’s style; they are sedate cats who prefer a serene home where little changes from day to day.
With large, expressive eyes and a voice that has been described as soft, pleasant and musical, Persians let their simple needs be known: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which they return tenfold.
This is one cat who is unlikely to climb up your curtains, jump on your kitchen counters, or perch on top of your refrigerator. She is perfectly happy to rule her domain from the floor or more accessible pieces of furniture. When you are at work or are busy around the house, the Persian is content to adorn a chair, sofa or bed until you are free to admire her and give her the attention she willingly receives but never demands.
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Although they are beautiful and sweet, Persians are prone to a number of potential health problems, most commonly related to their facial structure:
The most important thing to understand about caring for a Persian is the need for daily grooming. That long, beautiful coat doesn’t stay clean and tangle-free on its own. It must be gently but thoroughly combed and brushed every day, and regular bathing—at least once a month—is a good idea.
Another factor to consider is the litter box issue. Litter may become lodged in a Persian’s paws or coat. If the cat and the litter box aren’t kept scrupulously clean, a Persian is more likely than most to just stop using the box.
Excessive tearing can be a problem in this breed, so wipe the corners of the eyes clean daily to prevent under-eye stains from forming. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing.
It’s a good idea to keep a Persian as an indoor-only cat. She’s not a scrapper and would fare poorly against other cats, dogs, coyotes and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors. Nor is the Persian’s coat made for shedding dirt, leaves and stickers. Letting a Persian outdoors just means that much more time spent grooming the cat. Persians who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
The Persian has a distinctive appearance: a large, round head; large, round eyes; a short nose; full cheeks; and small ears with rounded tips. The head is supported by a short, thick neck and a deceptively sturdy, muscular body—a type known as “cobby.” A Persian’s legs are short, thick and strong with large, round, firm paws. The tail is short but proportional to the length of the cat’s body.
A long, thick, shiny coat with a fine texture completes the Persian’s look. It’s long all over the body and includes an immense ruff around the neck, a deep frill between the front legs, long ear and toe tufts, and a full “brush,” or tail. Persians can come in different “looks.” Some, known as Peke-face Persians, have an extremely flat face. Think twice about the breathing problems such a cat might have before deciding to get one. “Doll-face” Persians are said to have a more old-fashioned appearance, with a face that is not as flat as the show Persian or the Peke-face Persian.
Persians of all stripes stand out for their infinite variety of coat colors and patterns. Imagine, if you will, seven solid color divisions—white, blue, black, red, cream, chocolate and lilac—plus silver and golden division colors of chinchilla and shaded silver or golden and blue chinchilla and blue shaded silver or golden; and then there are the shaded, smoke, tabby, calico, particolor and bicolor divisions. That’s not counting the various pointed patterns of the Himalayan.
Eye color is related to coat color. For instance, white Persians have deep blue or brilliant copper eyes; other solid-colored Persians have brilliant copper eyes; silver and golden Persians have green or blue-green eyes; and so on.
Persians aren’t the best choice for a houseful of boisterous children and dogs, but they have no objection to being the object of a gentle child’s attentions or to rubbing along with a friendly dog who doesn’t chase them or otherwise cause them anxiety.

Cat Breeds
A thick, luxurious coat is only one of the wonderful qualities of the Persian cat. Persian cats bring joy to their families because of their loving personalities and gentle yet playful antics.
If you're looking for a cat that isn't into impressive displays of athleticism, the Persian might be the perfect breed for you. These cats love to lounge, particularly after they reach adulthood. Perhaps that's why some people call them furniture with fur. Don't be fooled by this reputation, though. These cats do exhibit a playful streak, particularly when their people are interested in joining the fun.
Not prone to excessive mischief, Persians are quiet and well-behaved pets. They aren't into opening drawers and cupboards like their Oriental cousins, and unlike some other breeds such as Siamese and Savannahs, Persians usually don't like walking on leashes and playing fetch. However, they are intelligent cats, capable of learning your routine, greeting you, and of course, curling up for snuggles as part of a daily routine.
Even though Persians are expert-level cuddlers, they are not terribly demanding. If you're looking for a cat that is happy to nap while you're gone, and will cheerfully accompany you through your evening routine, you'll definitely want to give thePersian a second look.
Last but not least, despite having something of a frou-frou reputation, Persians make excellent family pets. They have the ability to get along well with children, other cats, and even dogs.
Because Persian cats have a tendency to suffer from obesity, it's vital to offer them a high-protein, low carbohydrate diet that relies on real meat or fish as the main ingredient. Consider choosing a food that contains added Omega fatty acids to support skin and coat health.
The Persian cat requires daily grooming sessions to prevent tangles that could eventually form painful mats in its ultra-fine undercoat. Brushing and combing a Persian cat is no simple task. It's vital to comb down to the skin and not just brush along the top of the coat or you might miss tangles. This process is time-consuming, so some Persian cat owners opt to have their cat's bellies shaved or clip the entire coat into a lion trim for easier maintenance.
Persian cats also have facial folds that require cleaning once or twice per day, depending on whether the cat is prone to a lot of eye discharge. In addition, brush your Persian cat’s teeth daily, and trim the nails every few weeks.
Persian cats need exercise, but take care not to overdo it, especially in warm weather. Have fun playing with feather wands and lasers, but watch the pace of play and take a break if your Persian cat starts panting or suffering from shortness of breath.
Persians appreciate cat towers and window shelves that offer them a good view of everything that's happening in the household and neighborhood, and they like to sink their claws into scratchers, too. Just like other cats, Persians love to play with toys including catnip mice, interesting balls, and little stuffed animals.
The Persian is a brachycephalic cat breed, which means it has a push-in face. With the Persian's flattened face come some known health issues, including shortness of breath and overheating during exercise or in warm temperatures. Other health issues associated with flat-faced breeds are an elongated soft palate, narrow trachea, stenotic nares, and everted laryngeal saccules. Persian cats are also prone to allergies, which is a common issue for all brachycephalic cat breeds.
Other known Persian health issues include frequent eye injuries, dental disease and malocclusion (crowded and misaligned teeth), cancer, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD is an inherited disorder that is highly prevalent in the Persian breed as well as related breeds like the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair. Luckily, a genetic test is available so breeders can avoid passing this devastating disease on to future generations of kittens.
The Persian is an ancient breed, with a history that spans thousands of years. These cats—or cats with a similar appearance—can be seen on hieroglyphics that date back to approximately 1684 BC. However, the exact origins of the breed are unknown since we have no written history this far back.
Sometime during the 1600s, an Italian composer and adventurer named Pietro della Valle described Persian cats from the Khorazan region of Persia, noting that most had long, silky, gray coats. His manuscript, known as Voyages de Pietro della Valle, mentions that the cats made their way to Persia from India with Portuguese travelers.
With frequent travel came additional imports: both Persian and Angora cats made their way to France and England. In England, they were called French cats and they quickly gained popularity for their unique appearance and friendly personalities.
By the 1900s, Persian cats—then known as Persian Longhairs or simply as Longhairs—outpaced Angoras in terms of popularity, perhaps because Queen Victoria had two blue Persians and people of the day were heavily influenced by the Queen's personal tastes.
Today, Persians are renowned as North America’s most popular cat breed. The Persian is recognized by cat breed registries worldwide.
The Persian is one of the oldest cat breeds, tracing its modern roots as far back as the 1600s.
The Persian was once Britain's most popular cat, however it has been outpaced by the British Shorthair.
A Persian cat with a longer nose is called a doll face Persian, and more closely resembles the traditional or old-fashioned Persian cat breed.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The Persian, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed Persian or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase a Persian, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
Persian cats cost between  $1300 - $3000.
Persian cats tend to be medium in size. A fully grown Persian cat might weigh between 8-15 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 8"- 10" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for Persian is 14-15 years.
Persian are long-haired cats, so you do have to expect a certain amount of shedding from this breed, but they don't shed as much as other cat breeds.

That’s very common! As long as you’re brushing your kitty’s teeth and taking them in for regular dental cleanings, a little cat food smell after meals isn’t a problem.
Is it possible to get a baby Persian cat? I would like to get one for my little sister.

Is a 20” long litter  box going to be large enough for an adult male Persian?  He’s a kitten now, but I’m thinking of making a substantial investment in a litter box.
Yes, that’s quite a big litter box! I think it would be just right.
Thank you, Mallory!

The Persian is among the oldest cat breeds; its likeness has been found in hieroglyphics as far back as 1684 B.C. They were imported from Asia and eventually found in Italy in the 1500s. They were not introduced to North America until the latter part of the 1800s.
The popularity of the Persians quickly grew because of their luxurious long fur and sweet and loving natures. They come in many colors and patterns and have dense double coats.

Persian kittens are little puffs of adorableness! While it should be quite easy to find a breeder of Persian cats because of their popularity, they are costly. They will be even more expensive if you plan on purchasing kittens for breeding or show purposes.
But the essential thing to do is ensure that you only deal with a reputable breeder and ask the right questions. You’ll also want to see the kittens in person so you can check how well they’ve been taken care of and ask about the medical history of the parents.
Your kitten should be about 12 to 14 weeks of age before they leave their mother and littermates. Kittens need this time to wean from their mothers (at around 8 to 10 weeks of age) and learn what they need to know on how to be a cat from their siblings and mothers.
You could also think about adopting a Persian cat or kitten from your local animal shelter or rescue group. Since Persians are common, you could luck out. These cats will be decidedly cheaper than buying from a breeder, and more importantly, you’ll be rescuing a cat from what was likely a difficult life.

Persians are chill and gentle and are known to be perfect lap cats. They do best in quiet households because while they can be playful, they also enjoy just quietly hanging out with their favorite humans.
They are considered smart cats, but this is largely an individual quality. They are loving and gentle yet not particularly demanding. Persian cats have been popular since the 1500s for a reason!
Persians make wonderful family cats but would do best in homes with older children. Many small children can be noisy and rambunctious, which most Persian cats struggle to deal with.
If your children are relatively quiet, this is ideal; Persians do have playful, kittenish moments and can make great playmates.
Since the Persian cat has a laidback personality, they generally get along well with other pets, though this depends on the other pets. Dogs that are cat savvy and gentle with felines will work well with Persians. But rambunctious, hyper dogs aren’t great fits.

Persian cats aren’t that energetic, so they are prone to obesity, which means you should go easy on the treats. You also need to consider the Persian’s flat face, so getting a suitable bowl—something wide, flat, and elevated—will help.
You should provide your cat with a healthy, high-quality diet, which can be a combination of canned and dry food. Canned food is a great way to keep your cat at a healthy weight and give them extra water content. Finally, installing a cat water fountain is an excellent way to ensure that your pet gets enough water.
Getting a Persian to exercise isn’t always easy, given how laidback they are. You can try using things like feather wands and fishing line toys to get them going. You should also provide them with things that they can climb, like cat shelves and cat trees (also for scratching).
Just bear in mind that with their flat faces, Persian cats don’t do well in hot weather or when they get overheated from too much playtime.
Training Persian cats will require quite a bit of patience from you. Like many cats, they aren’t always that interested in training.
You won’t necessarily get them to perform any tricks, but if you start them young and use treats and praise, you should be able to get them used to grooming and maybe even staying off your counters.
Grooming the Persian is not for the faint of heart. If you’re not prepared to brush your cat every day, you might want to look at other breeds because the Persian has a double coat of long, silky fur that must be brushed daily. They also need help with cleaning their hindquarters and tear stains. Many Persian owners opt for professional grooming, but either way, you should get your cat accustomed to grooming at a young age.
You should provide your cat with a cat scratcher and keep your cat’s nails trimmed—once every few weeks should suffice. Finally, you can clean your cat’s teeth using a toothbrush and toothpaste, though dental treats should help if your Persian is less than thrilled with having their teeth brushed.
Unfortunately, Persians are prone to a wide range of health conditions. It’s essential to be familiar with these issues so you know what to be on the lookout for.

Male Persians tend to be a little larger and heavier than the females, with males averaging 9 to 13 pounds and females 7 to 10 pounds.
There are also the obvious physical differences that lead to spaying females and neutering males. Having your cat fixed will help prevent male cats from spraying in the house and running away in pursuit of females. It also helps with territorial aggression.
Unspayed female cats go into heat, which can be uncomfortable for cat owners to watch and uncomfortable for the cat.

Himalayan cats originated from crossing Persians with Siamese cats. So, technically, Himalayans are Persians with pointed coloring.
In the 1800s, Queen Victoria, a renowned dog person, fell in love with Persians. She adopted two Blue Persian Cats and treated them like family, which overwhelmingly contributed to the popularity of Persian cats.
Florence Nightingale was also a lover and owner of a Persian cat. Throughout her lifetime, she owned 60 cats! Her favorite was Mr. Bismarck, a male Persian cat that she adopted after attempting to find a home for him.
The first known Persian cat arrived in the United States sometime around 1875. The Cat Fanciers’ Association was formed in the States in 1906, and the Persian was one of the first breeds registered.

Persian cats are not right for every household. They need a quiet and calm environment and aren’t that active, preferring to spend their time sleeping and cuddling.
They are also indoor-only cats that will get along well with everyone in the home, including other cats and dogs, as long as they are low energy. You must be prepared for a great deal of grooming! Still, this act is a fantastic way to strengthen your bond with your cat.
If you’re looking for a loving, gentle cat that isn’t overbearing and you enjoy coat grooming, the Persian might be perfect for you!

One of the oldest and most recognizable cat breeds, the Persian cat is the parent breed for the Persian Breed Group, which includes the Persian, Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair breeds. They share the same body type, but the Exotic Shorthair’s short coarse hair differs from the long hair of the Persian and Himalayan. Known for their sweet, flat face, large, round eyes and fat cheeks, they get along with everyone. Find out more about this breed and if a Persian is right for you and your family.
Gentle
As with all cats in the Persian Group, Persians are medium sized, but appear larger than they really are due to their massive fur. Males are larger than females.
The Persian is a very healthy breed and can be expected to live between 8-11 years.
White, red, cream, black, blue, chocolate, lilac, silver, golden, tortoiseshell, blue-cream, tri-color, and sable. Persians also come in a variety of patterns, including tortoiseshell, bicolor, tricolor, tabby, smoke, shaded, and Himalayan (a light colored body with darker points, and blue eyes).

Gentle and quiet, Persian cats prefer being in a calm environment. They are very easygoing and prefer lounging on a sofa with their families. Persians communicate with their expressive eyes and soft, harmonious voices. They are an adaptable breed and will enjoy living with any family as long as they are loved and treated gently.
The ideal Persian breed is a strong cat with excellent boning and musculature, a well-balanced cat, giving the impression of robust power. The face should be round with a sweet, pleasant expression and large, round expressive eyes. The cat should be well-balanced physically and temperamentally, gentle and amenable to handling.
Cats in the Persian Breed Group are placid and exhibit bursts of kitten-like activity. They can be sleeping in the sun one minute and suddenly explode into action, running through the room and rolling around the next. Persians like to play with interactive toys, chase balls, and catnip mice, but you might have to keep after them to exercise on a daily basis.
Persians will stretch out next to you, sleep in your bed, and sit on your lap when they are in the mood. They do not mind changes in routine and are generally friendly with everyone.

The Persian cat is one of the oldest cat breeds and can been seen depicted in hieroglyphics as early as 1684 B.C.
Persians made their American debut in the early 19th century.
The glamorous Persian cat is one of our oldest breeds and evokes images of distant historical Persia and Turkey. Its long, luxuriant, flowing coat comes in a myriad of colors reminiscent and its pansy-like face with big round copper eyes is open and sweet. It has a short sturdy body and short legs like little tree-trunks to support its massive build. The Persian has been a popular pet since the dawn of the cat fancy in the late 1800s and its popularity remains high today. These are the cats that decorated the parlors of Queen Victoria’s day and that are in the dreams of all little girls wanting a fluffy white kitten as a pet. Don’t be fooled by their good looks! Persians are extremely intelligent and this helps them adjust easily to both the home and the show ring. They communicate with you with their expressive eyes and expect you to understand their wishes – they will also look at you incredulously when you misunderstand them, after all you are supposed to be intelligent!
The Persian has a sweet, gentle nature and blends easily into most households as they become comfortable in their new home. They are creatures of habit and prefer a calm atmosphere and gentle handling. They are happy to be combed and petted by children but are unlikely to join in boisterous games with them. They have quiet, musical voices but communicate mainly with their large expressive eyes. They like the security of the ground and are unlikely to be found leaping to the top of bookcases to explore the high ground. They eagerly play with a toy or a teaser but are equally happy to drape themselves decoratively in a favorite spot. The Persian cat will not demand your undivided attention but it will relish your attention when are ready to lavish some time on it. These are gentle cats that are comfortable in their own homes whether you are there or not, but be happy to see you when you return.
The long, luxuriant coat is the hallmark of the Persian. A heavy ruff surrounds the head, the coat flows over the body reaching to the floor in top examples of the breed and the tail is a thick flowing plume. The Persian coat takes time to maintain and each color and pattern has a distinct texture that requires special care. There are two main textures: A silky one associated with dominant colors like red and black that is shinier and more resilient than that associated with the dilute colors; And a soft cottony one that dilute colors, such as blue and cream, tend to have. This soft coat stains and mats more easily and needs extra attention. Whites can have either type of coat.
The coat needs daily combing with a metal comb to prevent tangles that can develop into mats and to remove loose hair that could result in hairballs. A regular bath is necessary and the routine should be established early with the young kitten. Many Persians love their bath once accustomed to it. After a towel dry to remove a lot of the moisture, the coat needs to be combed smooth as you gently blow it dry. Use conditioners to prevent the coat from drying out. Eyes should be wiped daily as the large eyes can attract dust and other irritants that may cause the eye to run.
The glamorous, dignified Persian comes in a wide array of colors so choose your favorite and enjoy a delightful companion – but be prepared to spend the time grooming your new addition. While tangles and mats are unsightly, they are also uncomfortable for the cat and can tug at the skin. They can also be painful to remove so care should be taken if one is found. Adding an engaging Persian to your world will add an extra splash of glamour to your home with this very special gentle companion.
Owners of Persians, Himalayans and Exotic Shorthair breeds should check with their breeder and veterinarian to ensure their cat has been checked for the following: Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), respiratory problems, eye problems, such as Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.
The Persian coat requires daily attention. Cats must be brushed and combed in order to keep the coat from tangling. In addition, the flat face must be cleaned regularly and carefully as tearstains can be deposited on the face.
Nails should be trimmed more frequently (once a week) when they are kittens and less frequently (every 2-3 weeks) as an adult. As with any cat, regularly brushing of teeth is recommended. Talk to your vet for instructions and suggestions.
Similar to any cat, the Persians and those in the Persian Breed Group need proper protein and nutrients. A high-quality diet is recommended. After altering (spaying/neutering), they have a greater tendency to become overweight, as with any cat. Owners should be aware of both the quality and quantity of foods being fed.
Fresh water should be available at all times. Water bowls should be washed and refilled with fresh water daily. As with all cats, it is important to give your cat fresh, clean water daily so they don’t hesitate to drink. If you worry about your cat drinking enough water each day, here’s a tip from some cat behaviorists: place the water bowl at least three feet away from any food. Cats’ noses are sensitive and an overwhelming smell of food may cause them to drink less. Many Persians do better with water fountains. It helps keep the hair on their chin and chest drier.

Persian Cats with their long flowing coats and open pansy-like faces are the number one breed
                            in popularity. Persian Cats have sweet, gentle personalities that blend into most households
                            once they feel secure in their new environment. Creatures of habit, Persian Cats are most at
                            home in an atmosphere of security and serenity, but with love and reassurance, can easily
                            adapt to the most boisterous of households. Their quiet, melodious voices are pleasant and
                            non-abrasive. They communicate delightfully with their large expressive eyes and make
                            charming pets for all ages. Persians have short heavily-boned legs to support their broad,
                            short bodies. They like to have their feet firmly planted and are not given to high jumping
                            and climbing. Playful but never demanding, they love to pose and will drape themselves in a
                            favorite window or chair, enhancing the decor in much the same way as a treasured painting.
                            Persian Cats are tremendously responsive and become a constant source of joy and delight to
                            their owners. Pleasurable as an unexpected sunbeam, their companionship is close and
                            enduring.
Persian Cats with their long flowing coats require proper maintenance. A daily run-through
                            with a metal comb to eliminate the potential of tangles and hairballs is helpful. An
                            occasional bath, attempted only after a complete comb-through and clipping of their nail
                            tips, will keep the coat clean, healthy and beautiful. It is wise to establish a routine of
                            bathing when they are young kittens.
Persians Cats are divided into seven color divisions for the purposes of competition. These
                            divisions are established on the basis of color pattern. Red peke-face Persians Cats, with
                            more extreme facial conformation, appear in both the Solid and the Tabby Division. Solid
                            chocolate and solid lavender Persians Cats are known as the Kashmir in CFF. It is still
                            called by this breed name in some older cat breed books.
Solid Colored Division of Persian Cats  ~ Blues (copper eyes only) 
                            ~ Blacks (copper eyes only)  ~ Chocolates (copper eyes only)  ~ Reds (copper eyes
                            only)  ~ Whites (copper, blue, or one blue & copper-called odd eyes)
In the Solid Division, only the pristine whites come in three different
                            eye colors. Some have brilliant copper or deep blue eyes, others the surprising combination
                            of one blue and one copper eye of equal intensity. The other solid colors have brilliant
                            copper eyes.
The coat color for all solids should be sound to the roots and free from
                            markings or shadings. Blues, once the apex of the breed, have been interbred with other
                            colors to produce a more uniform type. Their pale silver-blue coats are most beautiful when
                            viewed in natural lighting. Blacks have glossy patent finishes that glisten with intensity.
                            Pale milk-colored creams are the dilute of the deep vibrant glowing reds. Chocolates and
                            lilacs, introduced through the combination of Persian and Himalayan, are rarely seen. The
                            chocolate demonstrates a warm chocolate-brown color while the lilac is a warm lavender with
                            a pinkish tone.
The Shaded and Smoke Division includes the shell and shaded cameos which have red tipping
                            with a white undercoat. The cream shell and shaded cameos demonstrate a white undercoat
                            tipped with cream. The shell and shaded tortoiseshells have a mantle of black tipping with
                            well-defined patches of red tipped hairs while the shell and shaded blue-creams have blue
                            tipping with well-defined patches of cream tipped hair. The smoke Persian is one of the most
                            striking patterns of the Persian colors. There are six separate colors, black, blue, cream,
                            cameo (red), smoke tortoiseshell and blue-cream smoke. In repose, the smoke appears to be a
                            solid color cat. In motion, the coat will break open, giving glimpses of a startling white
                            undercoat. All should have the characteristic white ruff and ear tufts. The perfect balance
                            of undercoat to overcoat is transitory and the perfection of color balance can usually only
                            be seen six to eight weeks annually. Their brilliant copper eyes seem almost like burning
                            embers within the smoke setting.
The Tabbies are the extroverts of the Persian breed. They come in three patterns: classic,
                            mackerel and patched tabby. The patched tabby may exhibit either the classic or mackerel
                            pattern with the addition of patches of red. The classic tabby is identified by the bullâs
                            eye markings on the side of the body while the mackerel pattern is characterized by narrow
                            penciling encircling the body. The brilliantly contrasted markings can be as striking as an
                            exotic jungle cat.Often referred to as the âfunââ cat, tabbies are outgoing and
                            demonstrative. Their facial markings give them a zesty added appeal. Recognized colors are
                            silver, blue silver, red, brown, blue, cream, cameo and cream cameo. There are no patched
                            tabby patterns in red, cream and cameo. All have brilliant copper eyes except silver
                            varieties which also may have green or hazel.
TThe Parti-Color Division consists of the tortoiseshell, blue-cream, chocolate tortoiseshell
                            and lilac-cream. The tortoiseshell is a black cat dispersed with great patches of red. A
                            dividing blaze of color on the face adds interest to this brightly colored variety. The
                            blue-cream, a delightful study in pastel, is a solid blue cat patched with cream. The muted
                            coloring of the blue-cream and lilac-cream are as softly lovely as the tortoiseshell and
                            chocolate tortie are flashy. All four colors have brilliant copper eyes.
The Calico & Bi-Color Division consists of calicos, bi-colors, smoke and whites and tabby
                            and whites. Calicos have white coats splashed with vivid patches of red and black, while the
                            dilute calico is patched with blue and cream. The chocolate and lilac calicos have white
                            coats splashed with vivid patches of chocolate and red or lilac and cream respectively. A
                            van pattern is a white cat with color confined to the head and extremities. A maximum of two
                            spots of color are allowed on the body. Bi-colors (black, blue, red, cream, chocolate or
                            lilac with white) commonly exhibit white on the feet, legs, undersides, chest and muzzle.
                            All established colors and patterns of tabbies with white and smokes with white are shown in
                            this division. All have brilliant copper eyes except for the silver tabby with white which
                            also may have green or hazel.
The Himalayan is one of the most popular of all Persians. The Himalayan is shown in the
                            following point colors: chocolate, seal, lilac, blue, red, cream tortie, blue-cream,
                            chocolate-tortie, lilac-cream, seal lynx, blue lynx, red lynx, cream lynx, tortie lynx,
                            blue-cream lynx, chocolate lynx, lilac lynx, chocolate-tortie lynx and lilac-cream lynx.
                            Color is restricted to the facial mask and extremities with the body of various shades of
                            white to fawn. Himalayans were developed by breeding Persians to Siamese to combine the
                            Siamese point coloring with Persian type. After many years of cross breeding they were
                            approved as accepted color variations of Persians. All must have deep vivid blue eyes as
                            eyes other than blue are a disqualification.
