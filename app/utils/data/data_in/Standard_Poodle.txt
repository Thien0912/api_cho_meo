Standard Poodles enjoy widespread popularity in the United States, France, and Germany. While they originated in Germany, France adopted them as their national dog, and they’ve maintained strong popularity across Europe and North America for generations.
Standard Poodles require 60-90 minutes of daily exercise, split between walks, play sessions, and mental activities. Their athletic nature demands both physical workouts and mental challenges, making them ideal companions for active families who enjoy outdoor activities.

Poodles may be stereotypically “sassy.” However, they are actually exceptionally athletic. These large, intelligent dogs are known for their curly coats. Originally built for retrieving, these dogs are still very active and intelligent today. They learn things very quickly, but they can be prone to boredom.

45–70 pounds
Lifespan:
12–15 years
Colors:
Black, white, brown, apricot, silver, cream, red, grey
Suitable for:
Active families with children
Temperament:
Intelligent, energetic, affectionate, loyal
While Poodles can make great companion animals for the right family, they can also be a lot of work. Their coats require regular brushing and trimming. They need tons of exercise due to their energetic nature, and their intelligence makes them get bored easily.
However, lovers of the Poodle point out that they don’t shed and take to training very easily. They’re also friendly and affectionate to their families, including children. These dogs require the right family to take care of them. But when they are properly cared for, they can be great additions to the right family.

Standard Poodle puppies are a lot like any other puppy. They’re very energetic, but they tend to sleep a lot, too. Zoomies and boundless enthusiasm are both to be expected. These dogs are also born smart, so their intelligence shines through early. We highly recommend starting training right away to channel their intelligence and encourage good habits.
Early socialization is also crucial, even if these dogs are on the friendly side. If you want them to be well-adjusted as adults, it’s important that they are exposed to many people, places, and animals from a young age.
Standard Poodles are sometimes available from rescues and shelters. While these dogs may come from unknown backgrounds, it does provide you the opportunity to rescue a dog in need.
The more common route to adopting a Poodle puppy is to go through a quality breeder. Choose a breeder that prioritizes health and temperament over profit. Waitlists are common, and the cost of a standard Poodle can be high. However, you’re paying for the quality of the puppy.

Standard Poodles are known for their extremely high intelligence. In fact, they are one of the most intelligent breeds in the world. They excel in training and learning commands quickly. In fact, they’re commonly used as service dogs for this reason. Their intelligence also allows them to adapt to many environments effortlessly. They tend to be less anxious than many other breeds for this reason.
While they are often pretty intelligent, they can also be stubborn and independent, especially when they reach their juvenile stage. They require consistent training and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and keep them on their toes. If they become bored, they’re likely to tune you out.
When raised properly, these dogs bond strongly with their families and crave human interaction. They’re eager to spend time with their families and cuddle them profusely. If socialized, they extend this friendliness to others. They enjoy playing with their families especially.
Standard Poodles can also be pretty alert and watchful. If they notice anything off, they’ll be sure to report it to their owners. While they aren’t aggressive, they can tell the difference between someone who should be in your yard and someone who shouldn’t.
Standard Poodles can be great family dogs. They crave human interaction and love to play with children. They’re also exceptionally gentle and calm when exercised properly, making them suitable for families with children. However, their larger size can make them a bit of a hazard when they are excited, so keep that in mind if you have smaller children.
These dogs learn quickly and are very eager to please. Teaching them manners around the house is very straightforward. Plus, tricks are always fun to share with children. Poodles also form strong bonds with their family, becoming very loyal at an early age.
That said, Poodles can also be a lot for some people to handle. They require plenty of walking and playtime. They can also become bored easily, so they need more entertainment than other dogs. Their thick, curly coats require professional grooming once a month and daily brushing, which can be a lot for many families to handle.
Because of their larger size, they don’t always work well with smaller children. Dogs that are hitting puberty can be a bit hyperactive and may not understand just how big they are. They may accidentally injure children by running around the house.
Standard Poodles do get along with other pets when properly socialized. They won’t always get along with other pets, especially if not introduced to many other pets when they are young.
Poodles are naturally friendly, so they tend to get along with other animals. They don’t have a super high prey drive, allowing them to get along with cats. They’re also eager to please, so you can train them to accept other animals with ease. Their high intelligence allows them to learn and understand the rules pretty easily.
Proper socialization always helps these dogs get along well with others, so we highly recommend socializing them as early as possible.
However, every Poodle is unique. Some Poodles find it easy to get along with other animals, while others may have a higher prey drive. When introducing your dog to others, always do so cautiously and in a controlled manner.

Standard Poodles do not require any specific food or diet requirements. They work well on high-quality dog food designed for larger dogs. It is important to choose food designed explicitly for large dogs, though, especially when they are puppies.
Larger dogs simply have different nutritional needs from smaller dogs. If fed improperly, large dogs may be at a higher risk of hip dysplasia, which is sadly very common amongst all larger dogs, including Poodles. We highly recommend feeding quality food made for big dogs.
Puppies must be fed puppy food, too. They need different nutrition from your average adult, as they are still growing. Once your dog has reached almost their full size, you can switch to adult dog food. There isn’t necessarily a time when you have to switch to a senior dog food, though. These dog foods are often made with specific senior health problems in mind. However, there isn’t a specific age when your dog will develop these health problems.
Poodles are very active. Therefore, they may need food formulated for very active dogs. This food contains high amounts of calories and protein, which more active dogs need in higher amounts. You’ll need to keep an eye on your dog’s body condition to determine if they need more or fewer calories. You can also talk with your vet, who can weigh your dog to determine if they are under or overweight.
Occasionally, Poodles may develop health issues that require specific nutrition. In this case, you’ll be able to discuss your dog’s special nutritional needs with the vet.
Poodles are exceptionally active. They’re renowned for their high energy levels and athletic ability. Therefore, to stay happy and healthy, they require a committed exercise routine. You’ll need to provide at least 90 minutes of exercise a day. Typically, we recommend splitting this into two or three sessions.
Repetitive activities can help keep your poodle engaged and prevent boredom. These dogs get bored very quickly, so be sure to use their exercise routine to keep their mind entertained, too.
Puppies typically need less exercise than adults. However, they may need more exercise sessions. Adults often do well with 45 minutes twice a day, but puppies may need 15 minutes five times a day. Puppies tend to bounce back from exercise fast, but they also tire quickly.
Seniors tend to slow down, but keeping their activity level high can help keep them healthy. Don’t stop exercising your dog altogether just because they have slowed down a little bit.
Standard Poodles excel in training. They’re both eager to please and highly intelligent. Plus, they’re very friendly and sensitive to praise, allowing you to reward them with ease. Use positive reinforcement to train them early and quickly. Avoid punishment, as it may make Poodles ignore you altogether.
As soon as you bring your dog home, you should start training them. 8 weeks is not too early, and many breeders will start training their puppies before they even send them to their forever home. These dogs learn basic commands like sit, stay, and come relatively easily.
Always keep training sessions short. Start at only 5 minutes and work up to 10 minutes as your dog is able. These dogs get bored and need to work their brains. If you don’t, they’ll make their own entertainment, which is often not what you want them to do. Training should also be fun. Poodles will take a liking to training naturally, but they will be turned off if you use punishment or push too much.
While Poodles are easy to train, it’s still important to be patient. They may not pick every command up quickly. All dogs have weak spots that must be worked on.
As you probably know, Poodles need tons of grooming. They’re known for their beautiful, curly coat, but this impressive feature needs dedicated grooming. Daily brushing is absolutely necessary. Brushing your poodle every day helps prevent matting and keeps them clean. A quick brushing session can go a long way to removing dirt and debris, limiting the number of baths your dog needs.
You’ll need a slicker brush and a comb to work through your dog’s coat. Be gentle and section the coat to avoid missing any areas. Unless you happen to be a groomer yourself, you’ll need to get your dog professionally groomed every month or so. They need constant trimming, as their coat will simply keep growing. The groomer can also care for their nails and give them a bath, limiting the amount of grooming you must do at home.
You’ll also need to brush your dog’s teeth regularly. Brushing their teeth helps maintain good dental health and prevents dental disease, which is sadly very common for all dog breeds.
While puppies don’t need as much grooming as adults, you should still start grooming them early. This process prevents them from being scared of the brush later on. Use positive reinforcement and make those early sessions more about training than actual grooming.
Standard Poodles were bred as working dogs. Therefore, they’re pretty healthy and can live up to 15 years—much longer than many other large breeds. However, these dogs can still get certain health issues, some of which are very serious.
Hip dysplasia is the most common condition affecting Poodles. This condition occurs when the hip joint doesn’t form correctly, leading to wear and tear. Arthritis-like symptoms occur at a very early age, requiring constant management for the rest of the dog’s life. Around 12% of poodles end up with hip dysplasia.
Poodles can also get bloat, which is a serious, life-threatening condition. It occurs when the stomach twists and traps air, causing it to expand. Eventually, the stomach cuts off blood flow to the surrounding tissues. This condition can cause irreversible harm in only a matter of hours, so emergency surgery is required.
Addison’s disease is a genetic, autoimmune disorder that affects hormone production. It is chronic and does not go away. However, it can be managed through medication when diagnosed early.
Due to their floppy, hairy ears, Poodles can also develop ear infections. Their ears can trap moisture and harbor bacteria. Regular early cleaning and vet checks are absolutely necessary. If your dog’s ears seem dirty, you can clean them with a wet cotton ball.
Male standard Poodles are larger than female Poodles. However, that is where their differences stop. While some claim that there are temperament differences between male and female Poodles, none of these are proven.
Most differences beyond size occur due to hormones. Males may be more likely to mark their territory, and females go through personality changes when in heat. Females may also shed more when in heat, while males have a more even shedding pattern. Both genders may be more prone to specific health conditions, too.
However, when spayed and neutered, these differences decrease or even disappear altogether. Females won’t go into heat, so they won’t experience personality changes. The males won’t be driven by testosterone, so they’ll be less likely to inappropriately mark.

Most people see Poodles as “pretty” dogs who sit around and look nice. However, they were actually bred to retrieve waterfowl from ponds. They have a thick, water-resistant coat and webbed feet to make swimming in cold water easier.
Poodles are also one of the best truffle-hunting dogs. Their keen sense of smell and trainability allow them to sniff out truffles with ease. These truffle dogs are exceptionally valuable due to the price tag of truffles.
Especially in France, Poodles are very common subjects for the arts. Their unique haircuts and regal appearance make them fun subjects, and many famous artworks today come from the area where poodles were well-known.

Poodles are well-known dogs, but most people don’t realize how active and intelligent they are. In fact, they are one of the most active, intelligent dog breeds around, making them great at a wide range of jobs. They’re used for retrieving waterfowl, as service dogs, truffle hunting, and as family pets. Their high intelligence makes them exceptionally adaptable.
For active families, Poodles can be one of the best companion dogs. However, for others, they can be a bit much. Poodles can be hard to deal with when not properly exercised or trained.
Therefore, we only recommend them for dog owners with plenty of time on their hands.

Do not underestimate the Standard Poodle, despite gaining a foppish and silly reputation due to the exaggerated hair-cuts of the show dogs, the Standard Poodle is a clever, quick-witted and athletic dog. They are high-spirited and fun loving, make great watch dogs and will adore taking part in any activity their owners choose to indulge in!
The Standard Poodle is the oldest of the three Poodle sizes and the original, but their exact origins are unknown. Some say they originated in France but it is far more likely that they come from Germany. Their ancestors were the old water dogs of Europe who were famous for their intelligence and skill, and we do know that despite their glamourous appearance, the Poodles original function was as a hard-working water retrieving gundog, and they are still more than capable of doing a day’s work, with some retaining more hunting instinct than others.
Their intelligence and trainability also saw them co-opted into European circus troupes where they thrived – and it was in this capacity that the two smaller sizes of Poodles were developed.
Their flamboyant haircuts were originally practical with the aim of clipping off all unwanted coat that would get waterlogged, but still keeping hair where needed to protect joints and keep internal organs warm.
The ideal Standard Poodle owner is someone who really enjoys walking, training and grooming. Whilst Poodles can be clipped out, you’ll still need to brush daily to keep the coat soft and mat free. Standard Poodles fare best in homes that take part in dog sports (the Standard Poodle is capable of them all, from Schutzhund to Heelwork to Music and everything in between) or who enjoy training as a hobby rather than just a means to a well-behaved dog. A well exercised, well trained Standard Poo is easy to live with and a great companion for the whole family.
Standard Poodles take a great deal of exercise and want room to run. Expect an hour to two hours per day of walking and running, plus extra time to train or take part in dog sports and competition. The Standard Poodle may well enjoy swimming, so choose walking routes carefully if you don’t want to deal with a very soggy Poodle!
Although the breed standard specifies a minimum height, in reality the Standard Poodle is now a fairly tall dog and takes up a reasonable amount of space. You will need dedicated space to bath and groom if you intend on keeping them in a full coat and grooming yourself.
A secure garden with good, tall fencing is a must, ideally a flagged or paved yard as a wet lawn will be rapidly turned into a muddy racetrack! Town or country living will be fine as long as there are plenty of places to provide an interesting variety of walks and secure space to run off lead.
Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. Standard Poodles are also prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.
Standard Poodles do not shed and are often (though not always) tolerated by allergic people. Their coats do take a great deal of care, though, generally requiring professional grooming, as well as regular combing and brushing at home. The poodle should be taken to a groomer about every six weeks to be clipped, or you can learn how to do it yourself and this can be as simple as a 'sheep' style clip. Home grooming the standard poodle in full coat will require some specialist equipment!
The Standard Poodle is very intelligent and quick to learn. They love to learn and perform, in fact they are a bit of a show-off, one reason they do so well in the show-ring. They also can excel at all the dog sports – and have a lot of fun doing them too (although owners need a sense of humour as they can also be clownish!).
A bored Poodle means trouble, so aim to keep their minds occupied with a variety of training exercises, games and puzzle solving. The Standard Poodle is not hard to train, but you will need to be quick, engaging and fun to work with!
The Standard Poodle can make an excellent family pet, however the space, time and exercise requirements may mean this is not a suitable pet for a busy family with young children. With older children or teens who can help with training, walking and grooming however, they are a fun and active companion.
While many dogs are traditionally thought of as being good with children, all dogs and children need to be taught to get on with and respect each other, and be safe together. Even so, dogs and young children should never be left alone together and adults should supervise all interactions between them.

A breed standard is the guideline which describes the ideal characteristics, temperament and appearance including the correct colour of a breed and ensures that the breed is fit for function. Absolute soundness is essential. Breeders and judges should at all times be careful to avoid obvious conditions or exaggerations which would be detrimental in any way to the health, welfare or soundness of this breed.
From time to time certain conditions or exaggerations may be considered to have the potential to affect dogs in some breeds adversely, and judges and breeders are requested to refer to the Breed Watch information related to this breed for details of any such current issues. If a feature or quality is desirable it should only be present in the right measure. However, if a dog possesses a feature, characteristic or colour described as unacceptable, it must not be rewarded in the show ring.


Well balanced, elegant looking with very proud carriage.

Distinguished by a special type of clip for show activity and by a type of coat which does not moult.

Gay-spirited and good-tempered.

Long and fine with slight peak. Skull not broad, moderate stop. Foreface strong, well chiselled, not falling away under eyes; cheek bones and muscle flat. Lips tight-fitting. Chin well defined but not protruding. Head in proportion to size of dog.

Almond-shaped, dark, not set too close together, full of fire and intelligence. Eye colour, see 'colour' below.

Leathers long and wide, set low, hanging close to face.

Jaws strong with perfect, regular and complete scissor bite, i.e. upper teeth closely overlapping lower teeth and set square to the jaws. A full set of 42 teeth is desirable.

Well proportioned, of good length and strong to admit of the head being carried high and with dignity. Skin fitting tightly at the throat.

Well laid back shoulders, strong and muscular. Legs set straight from shoulders, well muscled.

Chest deep and moderately wide. Ribs well sprung and rounded. Back short, strong, slightly hollowed; loins broad and muscular.

Thighs well developed and muscular; well-bent stifles, hocks well let down; hindlegs turning neither in nor out.


Previously customarily docked.
Docked: set on rather high, carried at slight angle away from the body, never curled or carried over back, thick at root.
Undocked: Thick at root, set on rather high, carried away from the body and as straight as possible.

Sound, free and light movement essential with plenty of drive.

Very profuse and dense of good harsh texture. All short hair close, thick and curly. All traditional trims permissible in the show ring and the dogs judged on equal merit, as long as there is sufficient length to demonstrate colour and quality of coat.

All solid colours. White and creams to have black nose, lips and eye rims, black toenails desirable. Browns to have dark amber eyes, dark liver nose, lips, eye rims and toenails. Apricots and reds to have dark eyes with black points or deep amber eyes with liver points. Blacks, silvers and blues to have black nose, lips, eye rims and toenails. Creams, apricots, reds, browns, silvers and blues may show varying shades of the same colour up to 18 months. Clear colours preferred. Non solid colours are highly undesirable and should be heavily penalised.

Poodles (Standard): over 38 cms (15 ins).

Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and welfare of the dog and on the dog’s ability to perform its traditional work.

Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully descended into the scrotum.

Size – The Kennel Club breed standard is a guide and description of the ideal for the breed; the size as described does not imply that a dog will match the measurements given (height or weight). A dog might be larger or smaller than the size measurements stated in the breed standard.
