The Norwegian Forest Cat (Norwegian: Norsk skogkatt or Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe.[1] This landrace breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace breed of short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora.
During World War II, the Norwegian Forest Cat was nearly extinct; then the Norwegian Forest Cat Club's breeding program increased the cat's number. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and France.
It is a large breed with a strong body, similar to the Siberian and Maine Coon cat breeds, with long legs, a bushy tail, and a sturdy body. It is very good at climbing, partly because of its strong claws.
The Norwegian Forest Cat is adapted to survive Norway's cold weather.[2][3] Its ancestors may include cold-adapted black and white British Shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain some time after 1000 AD by the Vikings, and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders around the 14th century. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and may have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest breed.[4][5][6] The Siberian and the Turkish Angora, longhaired cats from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed.[4]
Norse legends refer to the skogkatt as a "mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage."[7] Since the Norwegian Forest Cat is a very adept climber,[8][9] author Claire Bessant believes that the skogkatt folktale could be about the ancestor of the modern Norwegian Forest breed.[7] The name Norse skogkatt is used by some breeders and fancier organizations for the modern breed.
The ancestors of the Norwegian Forest Cat most likely served as ships' cats (mousers) on Viking ships.[10] The original landrace lived in the Norwegian forests for many centuries, but were later prized for their hunting skills and were used on Norwegian farms,[11] until they were discovered in the early 20th century by cat enthusiasts.[12]
In 1938 the first organization devoted to the breed, the Norwegian Forest Cat Club, was formed in Oslo, Norway.[13] The club's movement to preserve the breed was interrupted by World War II. Owing to cross-breeding with free-ranging domestic cats during the war, the Norwegian Forest Cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program.[14][15]
In the 1950s, King Olav V declared them the official cat of Norway.[16] Since the cat did not leave Norway until the 1970s, it was not registered as a breed in the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), the pan-European federation of cat registries, until Carl-Fredrik Nordane, a Norwegian cat fancier, took notice of the breed, and made efforts to register it.[13] The breed was registered in Europe by the 1970s, and in the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1994.[17] In 1978, it was recognized in Sweden as an official breed,[18] In 1989, they were accepted as a breed in the United Kingdom by the Norwegian Cat Club of Britain.[19]
The Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway and Sweden. Since 2003, it has been the fifth most popular cat breed in France, where there are about 400 to 500 births per year.[20][21][22]
The Norwegian Forest Cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat. Adult females weigh 3.6–8 kg (7.9–17.6 lb); males, 4.5–9 kg (9.9–19.8 lb). The breed has a long, sturdy body; long legs; and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, thick, glossy, water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest, and head.[7] The undercoat appears as a ruff. The profile of the breed is generally straight.[10] Their water-resistant coat with a dense undercoat developed to help the cat survive in the harsh Scandinavian climate.[23]
The head is long with an overall shape similar to an equilateral triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head is considered to be a defect.[24] The eyes are almond-shaped and oblique, and may be of any color.[7][25] The ears are large, wide at the base, and high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of hair like the ears of the lynx.[24]
All coat colors and divisions in the traditional, sepia, and mink categories are accepted.[24] Since the cats have very strong claws, they are very good climbers, and can even climb rocks.[17]
They are friendly, intelligent, and generally good with people.[4] The Norwegian Forest Cat has a lot of energy.[4] Fanciers note that these cats produce a variety of high-pitched "chirping" vocalizations.[citation needed]
Norwegian Forest Cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life.[6]
A study comparing Norwegian Forest Cat kittens to Siamese, Oriental, and Abyssinian kittens found the Norwegian Forest Cat to be more likely to explore and try to escape.[26]
In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed.[27][28] This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it.[4] Glycogen storage disease type IV due to branching enzyme deficiency was found in an inbred family of Norwegian Forest Cats.[29]
The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia,[30] which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.[31]
An analysis of pedigree records of cats in England found evidence of hereditary cardiomyopathy.[32] A 2005 study looking at 17 cases of eosinophilic granuloma complex in Norwegian Forest Cats found a link between the cats after reviewing pedigree analysis, suggesting a hereditary nature of the condition.[33]

Cat Breeds
Striking looks and a warm personality help the Norwegian Forest Cat stand out from the crowd. This exquisite long-haired cat breed is an ancient one, with ample intelligence, fantastic social skills, and an appreciation for all of life's comforts.
Even though the Norwegian Forest Cat comes from a cold climate, these cats love to keep warm. They appreciate an indoor lifestyle with plenty of soft, comfortable surfaces to accommodate frequent naps. They also have an appreciation for their human families, but affection takes place on their terms rather than yours.
The Norwegian Forest Cat might decide to cuddle up in your lap or sleep on your pillow, but doesn't typically enjoy being picked up or held when it's not the cat's idea.
Despite the breed’s reputation for having quite an independent streak, Norwegian Forest Cats are loyal to their favorite people and are perfectly capable of making friends with other pets, including well behaved dogs and other friendly cats.
If you see similarities between the Norwegian Forest Cat and the Maine Coon, you’re not imagining things!
The two breeds do have quite a bit in common, including large stature, ultra-thick fur, and exceptional hunting prowess. Some experts believe that Norwegian Forest Cats might be one of the breeds that contributed to the  development of the Maine Coon (which, like the Norwegian Forest Cat, is a natural breed).
As a relatively large breed, the Norwegian Forest Cat might require more calories per day then the average cat, especially if they are very active. These cats need a high-quality diet and will thrive on high-protein food with real meat or fish as the primary ingredient.
If you are able to offer fresh food, your Norwegian Forest Cat will certainly appreciate it. At any rate, consider choosing food that contains extra omega fatty acids to support your pet's skin and keep their coat looking and feeling its best.
The Norwegian Forest Cat has a very thick double coat, but it requires far less frequent grooming than you might think. Weekly brushing or combing is usually sufficient to prevent mats and keep the luxurious coat looking its very best.
Additional grooming routines to consider include regular nail trimming and daily toothbrushing. Both should be introduced from a young age.
The Norwegian Forest Cat might be very fond of lounging, but this doesn't mean that it's a complete couch potato. These big, fluffy cats are athletes at heart, with a fondness for running, jumping, and climbing.
They have the unique ability to descend from their cat tree headfirst, and their size allows them to clear several feet in a single leap. Appropriate enrichment items are essential including tall cat trees, big scratching posts, and an abundance of toys.
Norwegian Forest Cats typically enjoy excellent health and are known for their longevity. It is not unusual for one of these cats to live well beyond 15 years. Even so, the Norwegian Forest Cat breed is prone to a few known health issues.
Although these don't occur often, it's important to be aware of their existence. Potential problems include glycogen storage disease type IV, which can be detected in parents via a DNA test. Glycogen storage disease type IV often causes kittens to be stillborn or survive for less than six months.
Norwegian Forest Cats might also suffer from polycystic kidney disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
The Norwegian Forest Cat is a natural breed, meaning that it developed over time without intentional intervention or human manipulation. The Norwegian Forest Cat—called skogkatt in Norwegian—was brought to Norway hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years ago. No one knows for certain whether they accompanied Turkish traders or if they were brought back by Viking raiders. What we do know is that Norwegian Forest Cats have an intriguing place in Norse mythology. For example, the giant cats that pulled the goddess Freya’s chariot were said to be skogkatts.
In 1938, a Norwegian Forest Cat was presented at a cat show. Shortly afterward, enthusiasts came together to form the Norwegian Forest Cat Club.
Like many other breeds, the Norwegian Forest Cat nearly became extinct during World War II. After the war however, members of the club came together to revive the breed and propel it back toward popularity.
Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) granted the breed official recognition in 1977. It took another 10 years for the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) to recognize the breed. CFA granted Norwegian Forest Cats full championship status in 1993. Today, major registries worldwide have accepted the breed with open arms.
Norwegian Forest Cats are slow to mature, taking up to five years to reach their full potential.
Many cats dislike water, but the Norwegian Forest Cat isn't afraid to get wet. In fact, this cat will happily attempt to fish in a pond or clean out all the fish in the family's aquarium.
Norwegian Forest Cats are nicknamed "Wegies." During the 1950s, the breed was declared the official cat of Norway by King Olav V.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The Norwegian Forest, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed Norwegian Forest or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase a Norwegian Forest, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
Norwegian Forest cats cost between $900-$1,500.
Norwegian Forest cats tend to be large in size. A fully grown Norwegian Forest cat might weigh between 12-16 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 9"- 12" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for Norwegian Forest is 14-16 years.
Norwegian Forest are long-haired cats, so you do have to expect a certain amount of shedding from this breed, but they don't shed as much as other cat breeds.
I got my fur baby at my work, the poor baby was dumped. It turned out she had tape worms and a couple other scares, but she’s all good now. She’s the friendliest and most playful cat I’ve
 ever had.
Bro, I live in Canada- Where can I get one????? Or is it just in Europe???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
There are many of these cats in Eastern Washington State on farms, also known as farm cats. Typical farmer does not pay any additional amount of attention to farm cats since they simply provide one service and that is to help reduce rodent population. Their cats are typically not named and just go by the black cat or the gray cat. If not inside at night or even during the day their population is controlled by local Coyote population. We have two farm cats and are always kept inside at night, during the day they like to be outside with their humans if it is not raining. They are also very keen at staying safe under things when outside to stay safe from predatory birds, which like to hunt cats like rabbits.
My girl comes from the SPCA, where she was left by the person who found her. As she was a very young declawed cat – too young to be declawed locally before it was made illegal – found in cottage country I can only assume she wandered away or was left behind by foreign cottagers. Thinking someone must miss her terribly I advertised her a few times online, hoping to find her people when they returned the next summer, but now, two years later, I’d be heartbroken to lose her. She is the sweetest, most affectionate, most gentle animal I’ve ever lived with. Less important but worth noting; she is stunning and attracts many compliments. Just a beautiful cat in both appearance and personality.
She is playful and vocal, unfazed by water, and was quickly leash trained. She must, absolutely must, be sitting right beside her favourite person when possible but is not a lap kitty. She is friendly with everyone, including children, and does not run from strangers. In short, the ideal pet for anyone who wants a cat that integrates into the household. That said, there are a few things to consider.
If my girl is typical, this is a cat breed that produces a ton of hair, especially in spring/summer when they shed their undercoat. I have to sweep and vacuum daily or else I’ll have rolling furballs, even though she gets a daily brushing. She isn’t independent, so there’s no skipping multiple daily playtimes without her becoming demanding and vocal – this is very much a breed that needs companionship to be happy, either with people or other animals. They also have big appetites; as someone else mentioned, the bowl needs filling more often than you’d expect. NFCs love to jump and climb; if kept indoors, an extra-tall cat tree is a must – my girl makes good use of hers. There’s also a strong hunting instinct; I wouldn’t advise keeping fish, birds, or other small pets in the same home unless extra measures are taken to keep them safe. Likewise, make sure these cats can’t leap off balconies or out windows to chase wildlife.
So if you are looking for a real companion, not a kitty who is 100% self-maintaining, and have an active household where a big, beautiful cat will fit in well get yourself an NFC if the opportunity arises. They’re fun and adorable. Also, please don’t declaw your cat.
I got mine as a kitten that was dumped with 4 other kittens. He was running in front of some kids and at first I thought it was a puppy!  I had them bring him to me and get the other kittens   He had seriously grown into the best cat and still is like a dog. Loves to go for walks on a leash!
We have an NFC, that came to us via abandonment when he was~12 months old. He was dumped in a state forest near us & was “rescued” by some friends who breed Huskys, & they had him “treed” in their yard on the edge of the forest.
In reading the previous posts, I’m left thinking, “what is it with people abandoning these beautiful babies?”
Anyhoo, we advertised in the hope that he may have strayed, to no avail.
He is now 8 years old, & I, like some on here, had wondered if he was part Maine Coon, until I happened on a descriptor of the NFC breed, which included a picture the was almost 100% identical to Merlin ( we find him quite magical!).
He is the most gentle of cats, & did not reach maturity until he was 5 years of age.
Merlin also likes coming along on doggy walks, as I’m sure sometimes he thinks he’s a dog.
He grew up alongside our miniature Dachshund, Lucy, & they are the best of pals.
We have 3 other cats, a Ragdoll, a Burmese & a Moggie, who was rescued from the wall cavity of a house, where her mother had accidentally (I assume) dropped her when she was a few weeks old.
So, the upshot of my tale, is that an NFC is a cat very much worth having, as they are a wonderful & gentle breed.
Peace, out.
Our Wegie loves to be swept on his back with a broom. I let him walk into the raised broom and scratch his back as he coyly walks by. He will make about 20 passes until finished. We found our golden nugget at the animal rescue. He is also a great mouser and brings me “presents” of his treasures. Thankfully this happened only once that I am aware.
My roommate rescued and adopted one of these guys a few months ago when he saw him starving in the road during the dead of winter. He first thought it was a Maine Coon kitten but I recognized it as a Norwegian Forest Cat as one of my friends had one that lived to 21 or 22. I do like this breed, but I do have some qualms about it too. It is a very pretty cat with it’s long hair, ear tufts, big paws, derpy face, and toe hairs. It’s also a very friendly cat. The playful nature and natural hunting instinct can be trying at times though. Basil, the name my roomie and I chose for his cat, will often playfully attack people and my cat. Him play attacking wouldn’t be so bad if his claws weren’t as sharp as daggers. My cat, an older Russian blue/DSH mix, doesn’t really like to be bothered by other cats so she’s often distressed when he play attacks her too. My friend who had one also said his would do the same thing too and that lasted for about eight or so years. So, it’s definitely a beautiful and friendly cat but you have to be patient or this cat may be too much for you.
I had to run DNA on my tom cat    I received a report stating he has Norwegian Siberian Mane Coon   etc he is 26 lbs but very affectionate SPECIAL. I love him
In the youtube wegie group, I don’t know jf they still do this (I left the group because of it), but in the past, they said that even if Jinx was 100% purebred Wegie, without papers, he is nothing.  Totally insane, if you ask me.  To me, if it looks exactly like a duck, plays exactly like a duck, acts exactly like a duck the rest of the time, and has ALL of the characteristics of a duck, it’s not a chicken, it’s a duck.  🙂
I got Jinx at Pet Welfare on Eglin AFB for $100, which covered neutering, shots, chip, and a full exam by a vet.  Back then, everyone thought he was a DSH.  That didn’t last very long.  🙂  From the day I got him he’s been the most loving cat.  He loves using one or both of my legs as pillows, and sleeps between them at night.  Their reputation as gentle giants is well deserved.  Jinx will finally be an adult in 7 months when he’ll be 5 y/o.
If you can afford them (or get lucky like I did), don’t hesitate.  But be prepared for a LOT of sweeping, as Wegies shed more in one day than most cats do in a week.
I lived on a small forested lake in Michigan, and occasionally fed the forest wild cats. I was developing a playful relationship with one of the Spring forest kittens when I noticed a fisherman’s Treble hook stuck in her mouth and gums. I figured she was hungry and smelled the bait left on the ifshing poles. After the Vet removed the lure and ‘fixed’ him, he came to live with my other cat. Little did I know this new addition to my cat family was a Norwegian forest cat. Amazing! He is loving, playful, attentive, and understands Basic Cat English  🙂  A beautiful and sweet addition to our Family.
Best cat I’ve ever had. very affectionate and sweet but for some reason will not sit in your lap. Just as well, she weighs a ton!
.We first found our Orange Tabby cat that we were told it was a Maine Coon and for the first 10 years we have grown to love this huge loveable Cat. One of the characteristics was he was dog like in his actions and playfulness.  He will “growl” at someone coming to the door, then run and hide as we open the door.  He likes to play “fetch” and is very dog like in so many ways and has all the characteristics of a Maine Coon, until we saw the Norwegian Forest Cat. I know that is his breed as it is him exactly so he is not a Maine Coon but a Wegie. one problem we are having is he keep defecating on the carpet. He will go in his box but sometimes will step out and drop it on the carpet, His box is clean when this happens as we have been wanting to try and correct this but to no avail. Does anyone have any suggestions? We keep his box clean and emptied to not encourage anything or anywhere else. He is a house only cat …. HELP
Hey James, that’s a good question. It sounds like your cat might have some constipation causing his poops to stay “in” rather than coming out all the way while he’s still in the litter box. You might find some helpful information in our article on the best cat food for constipation.
Try standing with your back toward the litter box facing away from the cat in the box. Stand tall and be quiet. When your cat is done doing it’s business, slowly walk away. Do this frequently and this will give your cat confidence that you really do love and protect it. And always keep box clean daily in fact multiple cleans a day if possible. Cats read that as a very loving thing.
My Wegie is a sweet, loving, intelligent 9 year old male. He is huge and makes his presence known with his loud meowing; it almost sounds like he is saying hello. I often find him sitting in an upright position grooming himself or laying on his back. He snores lol
He is shy around strangers, he doesn’t like loud noises or sudden movements.
I love my Wegie, he is the best cat I’ve owned
I found my wedgie abandoned in my parking lot 4 yrs. ago!  Had no idea what breed she was til I took her to the Vet.  Needless to say, I was thrilled to hear that!  She is the most AWESOME cat I’ve ever rescued!  And checking into her breed was so helpful in raising her as she was about 1 -1/2 yrs. old when I found her.  Couldn’t believe someone just dumped her…I actually saw the girl that did it as she lived across the street and told me she had to get rid of it because it was eating her canaries …well DUH!!  I tried to say nicely to her that cats and birds really don’t go together inside!!  Hey, her loss, my GOLD as I say!  I would recommend this breed to anyone that can afford one; well worth the money even tho’ I got my girl FREE!
Thanks for sharing, Pam!
Ours was found abandoned in an empty alley brick building. He’d been hurt. We took him in and nursed him back to health.  He was about a year old. Our vet found no chip and so we kept him. He is an absolutely wonderful cat. He does not meow, but squeaks. It is an endearing sound. We imagine he may have been injured and that caused it. He is now three and BIG! He’s just as they are described on this page about them.
OMG I would love one of these.  Are there breaders in the US?
Yes, there are! Here’s a nice directory for you.
I have a kitty that is this. He’s so playful and loveable. For the longest I thought he was part Maine coon. He’s such a wonderful addition to the our family. He’s great with kids. I will say, he is a large breed so don’t put food or things low because he will get it by standing on his hind legs lol. Also be prepared for a hefty food bill. They, well at least mine, eats a lot. By 3 months he was larger than my 10 year old silver british tabby. I would fill the cat dish 2 times a day where before I got him I could go 3 days without refilling it. He loves meat and has very natural hunting instincts. I hope you got one because they are wonderful!
P.s this article is spot on from looks to how they act
Very talkative and friendly
I have a wegie her name is Hanna, what flea stuff do I use
Use the same flea products and medications you’d use for a cat of any other breed! Here’s a link to our guide to the safest and most effective products you can buy.

The Norwegian Forest cat (also known as the Skogkatt or Wegie) is a large, long-haired cat breed that is native to Norway. They are known for their thick, double coat that helps them to withstand the cold winters in Norway. Norwegian Forest cats are also known for their gentle and affectionate nature, and they make great family pets.
Norwegian Forest cats come in a variety of coat colors, including white, black, blue, red, cream, silver, and golden. They can also have solid, bicolor, tortoiseshell, calico, and tabby fur patterns. The most common coat color is brown tabby. Norwegian Forest cats are relatively rare in the United States, but they are becoming more popular.
When considering a Norwegian Forest, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a cat in need. However, if you decide to purchase, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their cats. Reputable Norwegian Forest breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their cats, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the kitties. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy kitty while discouraging unethical breeding practices.
Some cat breeds are typically independent and aloof, even if they’ve been raised by the same person since kittenhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn’t the only factor that goes into affection levels; cats who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.

Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems. This doesn’t mean that every cat of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they’re at an increased risk. If you’re looking only for purebred cats or kittens, it’s a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you’re interested in.

Some cats are perpetual kittens—full of energy and mischief—while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful kitten sounds endearing, consider how many games of chase the mouse-toy you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other animals who can stand in as playmates. A classic wand cat toy like this one is perfect for playful felines!

Some breeds sound off more often than others with meows, yowls, and chattering. When choosing a breed, think about how the cat vocalizes and how often. If constant “conversation” drives you crazy, consider a kitty less likely to chat.

Being tolerant of children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a nonchalant attitude toward running, screaming youngsters are all traits that make a kid-friendly cat. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual cat will behave; cats from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences and personality.

Stranger-friendly cats will greet guests with a curious glance or a playful approach; others are shy or indifferent, perhaps even hiding under furniture or skedaddling to another room. However, no matter what the breed, a cat who was exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a kitten will respond better to strangers as an adult.

The Norwegian Forest Cat is native to Norway, with a history going back hundreds and maybe thousands of years. He figures in fairy tales and legends, one being that the Norse goddess Freya’s chariot is pulled by six giant cats. Where or how the cats originated remains a mystery. They may be the descendants of longhaired cats from Turkey, brought back from Byzantium by Scandinavian warriors who served the Byzantine Empire, or they may be related to the Siberian cat from Russia.
They could have been Viking booty, or they could simply have been the result of natural selection: shorthaired cats whose adaptations to the harsh, near-Arctic climate produced descendants with woolly undercoats and long topcoats that shed water with ease.
For centuries, the skogkatt—a Norwegian word that translates as “forest cat”—survived by his wits or offered his services as a mouser to farmers and housewives in exchange for shelter in barns, stables, or homes. In 1938, the cats were exhibited at a show in Oslo, but World War II interrupted any plans for developing them as a breed.
Fortunately, they survived the war, just barely, but there were still some hard decades ahead and little was done with them until the 1970s. In 1977, they were finally registered as a breed with Europe’s Federation Internationale Feline. Two years later, a pair of NFCs was exported to the United States for the first time. The breed has since become popular in Europe and the U.S.
These are big cats. Males can weigh 13 to 22 pounds or more, with females somewhat smaller. The Wegie matures slowly and isn’t full grown until 5 years of age.
The Norwegian Forest Cat is satisfied to be in the same room with people and will entertain himself if no one is home. Although he appreciates human company, he can be a bit reserved with visitors. Even with family, he’s not much of a lap cat, but a nice scritch between the ears or beneath the chin is always welcome, and he’ll usually reciprocate with a nice head butt or cheek rub. He communicates with classic Scandinavian restraint.
His quiet voice is employed only when he needs something—dinner on time, perhaps—and rises only if he is ignored. Not surprisingly, this large and athletic cat is a climber. You will often find him at the highest point he can reach in the home, and unlike some cats, he doesn’t have any qualms about descending trees or other heights headfirst.
Thanks to his heritage as a wilderness and farm cat, not to mention his waterproof coat, the Wegie thinks nothing of fishing in a body of water for a nice meal. Aquarium and koi pond denizens, beware! While he loves the outdoors, he is content to live quietly in a home. This is a smart, independent cat who learns quickly and has an alert nature. He likes to play and thrives with a busy family that loves him.
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Norwegian Forest Cats are generally healthy, with a long life span of 14 to 16 years. The following diseases have been seen in the breed:
Brush or comb the Norwegian Forest Cat’s long coat once or twice a week, using a bristle brush, wire slicker brush or stainless steel comb. If you run across tangles, work them out gently so you don’t hurt the cat. A bath is rarely necessary, which is a good thing. With the Wegie’s practically waterproof coat, it can be very difficult to get him wet enough for a bath.
Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes daily with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly.
If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear. Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Like all cats, Wegies are very particular about bathroom hygiene.
A clean litter box will also help to keep their fur clean. He is certainly built to survive a cold climate, but it’s a good idea to keep a Norwegian Forest Cat as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car.
Wegies who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such an unusual cat without paying for it. If possible, build your Wegie a large outdoor enclosure where he can enjoy the elements safely.
The Norwegian Forest Cat is notable for his long, thick, beautiful coat and large size. The head has an inverted triangle shape, pointed at the chin and then widening on each side up toward the medium to large ears, which are heavily tufted.
Large, almond-shaped eyes are green, gold, or copper, although white cats may have blue eyes or odd eyes (one blue eye and one eye of another color). The moderately long body looks powerful, with its broad chest and heavily muscled thighs. Large round paws have tufts of fur between the toes. The bushy tail is as long as the body.
The weatherproof double coat varies in length. The “bib” begins with a short collar at the neck, “mutton chops” on the side, and a full frontal ruff. Full britches—long hair on the thighs—cover the hind legs. On the body, the coat is long and flowing, but it changes with the seasons. A Wegie in summer looks relatively naked compared to his full winter glory. The coat comes in almost every color and pattern, with or without white, with the exceptions of chocolate, lavender lilac, or a pointed pattern like that of the Siamese.
The friendly, laidback Norwegian Forest Cat  is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. He loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect, and he doesn’t mind playing dress-up or going for a ride in a baby buggy.
He is happy to live with other cats and cat-friendly dogs, too, thanks to his amiable disposition. Introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.

Norwegian Forest Cats are exceptionally loyal companions known for their loving and gentle nature. These intelligent, longhaired beauties love to climb to new heights and observe their environment with their large, expressive eyes.
Also known as the "mystic wildcat of fairy tales", the semi-longhaired Norwegian Forest Cat breed is believed to be around 1000 to 2000 years old. This breed is frequently mentioned in Norwegian urban myths and folklore and is very popular across much of Northern Europe. These strong and sturdy cats originated in Norway, and are well-suited to brutal winters with insulated, waterproof double coats that feature longer, coarse guard hairs over a dense undercoat. They are further distinguished by their large, almond-shaped eyes, triangle-shaped head and ears, and straight side proﬁle (from their brow ridge to the tip of their nose).
Some believe that the ancestors of this breed include black and white shorthair cats brought from Great Britain and longhaired cats introduced by the Crusaders. Others theorize that their ancestry lies with the Russian Siberian cat and the Turkish Angora. The breed was recognized and registered in Europe in the 1970s and was accepted for full championship status by the Cat Fanciers’ Association in 1993.
Norwegian Forest Cats are highly intelligent and have a sweet, calm temperament. They are social, friendly, and get along well with children and other pets. While they highly appreciate the company of their favorite humans, they do so on their own terms. These kitties love to explore, and their strong claws make them excellent climbers. A scratching post or a tall cat tree will go a long way toward entertaining these beautiful and majestic kitties.
Published studies have shown the Norwegian Forest Cat, among several other breeds, to be at a higher risk for diabetes mellitus. In a 2007 study, a complex rearrangement in the gene that codes for the glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) was identiﬁed in some Norwegian Forest Cats. The rearrangement causes glycogen storage disease type IV, characterized by a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration. The breed is also known to suﬀer from hip dysplasia.
They are Norway’s national cat. Their "Viking Cat" title was designated by King Olav V of Norway (born as Prince Alexander of Denmark).
Norwegian Forest cats were the favorites of Freya. Norse mythology (mythology of the North Germanic people), claims that the breed was the favorite kind of Freya, the goddess of love, beauty, fertility and health. Farmers believe that if they left milk out for Freya’s cats that they would be blessed with a bountiful harvest when she passed through their fields.
Thor, the god of thunder, could not lift a Norwegian Forest Cat. A famous legend holds that the hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder,and strength lost a contest to his enemy Jormungand, the middle child of Loki, who came disguised as a Norwegian Forest cat.
They are mountain-dwelling fairy cats. Other Norwegian myths describe this glorious feline as a "mountain-dwelling cat with the ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage". The myth has turned out to be true, since Norwegian Forest Cats are known for their exceptionally strong claws and ability to climb rocks!
They can scare the trolls away. Once upon a time, a farmer was having a Christmas supper with a group of trolls. A wanderer and his pet bear came by to spend the night during the feast. One troll, thinking the bear was the wanderer’s cat, offered the beast some food. The beast let out a fearsome growl instead! Because trolls are terrified of thunder, they all ran away, forever afraid of cats. Other tales describe the Norwegian Forest cats turning into trolls and trolls turning into cats.
