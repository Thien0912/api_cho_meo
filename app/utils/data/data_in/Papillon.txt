Some dog breeds naturally get along better with cats than others. If you’re hoping to become a multi-species home, you need to familiarize yourself with the breeds that are more likely to develop lifelong companionships with your feline family members. Papillons are among the most brilliant, affectionate, and energetic small dogs, but do they get along well with cats? Papillons certainly can get along with cats!
Read on to learn more.

Yes, Papillons can get along swimmingly with cats, provided they’re socialized from a young age. Paps are a small breed, similar in size to a cat. Their small size makes them less imposing and intimidating for your kitty.
Papillons are very people and animal-oriented dogs, needing to spend much time with their family members to avoid developing separation anxiety. If you can’t be at home with your Pap all the time, pairing them up with a buddy in the form of a dog-friendly cat or another pup is a great way to keep them occupied and happy in your absence.

Introducing your cat to a new pet, be it a dog or another kitty, should be a slow and deliberate process. Cats can be quite territorial, and if yours is used to running the home, he may not be open to sharing his space with another animal immediately.
A slow introductory period is key to increasing the chances of your kitty and Papillon hitting it off.
Your cat needs to always have access to a 100% dog-free sanctuary in your home. This can be any room in your home, but it should have a door so you can keep your Pap out.
This sanctuary needs your cat’s essentials: litter box, scratching post, water bowl, food bowl, and his favorite toys. Setting up a hiding spot to help him feel safer is not a bad idea.
It’s exceedingly rare for a cat and a dog to hit it off immediately. You should not expect them to tolerate one another in the first few weeks. It can take even longer than that in some cases. The key to successful integration is being patient and taking your time.
When you first bring your Papillon home, keep him and your kitty in separate rooms for the first few days. Don’t even let either animal see the other. Though they may be kept in different rooms, they can smell and hear each other. This step aims to allow the animals to get used to one another’s presence without being introduced face-to-face. This is especially important as you want to ensure your new pet has had its first vet check-up and been cleared of any illnesses before introducing the two.
Before allowing the two animals to interact physically, you’ll want them to get used to each other’s scent. Put an old t-shirt or blanket in each pet’s sleeping quarters. Let it sit there to “marinate” in their smell for two days. On the third day, swap the shirts or blankets so each animal can get accustomed to the other’s smell. Don’t be alarmed if your cat hisses at the item. This is all part of the desensitization process.
It is a good idea to familiarize your Papillon with basic commands before you introduce him to your kitty. Once he knows obedience cues like “sit” and “down”, he may be less energetic and excitable when meeting your cat for the first time.
Feed your animals on opposite sides of a closed door. This technique allows them to become accustomed to the other’s scent. The idea here is to teach them to associate the smells of the new pet with pleasant things, like their tasty meal.
Once the animals are used to one another’s scent, have each visit the other’s area when the other is away. Have someone in the family take the dog for a walk while you let the cat go into his room to sniff around. Then, take your kitty into another room while you allow your Pap to explore the cat’s space.
After a week or so of scent-swapping and area visits, your pets should be ready to see each other for the first time. These visits should be timed when both animals are calm and not in overly excitable or sleepy moods. They both need an escape route during these first eye contact visits, so don’t stick either in a cage or kennel, as they’ll feel stuck without a place to run to if the meetings become too overwhelming.
Once the two can eat “beside” each other on the opposite sides of the door, you can begin with meet and greets. Choose a common area of your home (e.g., not your cat’s special sanctuary) to host these meeting sessions.
Keep the first few sessions short and your Pap on a leash. Allow your kitty to set the pace of the first few meetings. He can come and go as he pleases, and do not force him to stay or restrain him in any way.
If either animal displays aggressive behavior, redirect them calmly. Never yell or physically punish your animal, as this can damage the bond you’ve built with them. Instead, provide both pets with a high-value reward after every positive interaction.
Continue with the short-and-sweet daily meetings and high-value rewards. The goal is to have both animals associate their meetings with something positive. End every session before either animal begins to stress out or show signs of aggression.
Once your pets appear to be getting along well, you can let them loose in the same room together. Keep your Pap on a leash so you can intervene if he gets excited and starts chasing your kitty. If tension rises, return to the daily meetings for a few days or weeks until you feel they’re ready to be free together again.
Consider only allowing your pets to have free reign of the home when you are there to supervise. You may not have to separate them every time, but it is not a bad idea to keep both safe while you’re away until you’re 100% sure you can trust them alone together.


Papillons are among the best breeds to adopt if you have a cat-friendly household. Paps enjoy constant company, and having a feline companion is great for keeping separation anxiety at bay when you must leave the house. Of course, a proper introduction period should be expected. Never let your dog and cat be alone together until they’ve been introduced slowly and socialized together.

Often called the “Butterfly Dog” because of its fringed ears that resemble a butterfly’s outspread wings, the Papillon (“Pap-ee-YAWN”) is one of the oldest purebred Toys. It appears in paintings in Italy as far back as the 15th century. In France the court ladies and royal children were frequently painted with a Toy Spaniel pet, as the breed was then known. As the merchant class in the Low Countries (modern Belgium and Holland) became wealthy, the little dwarf spaniel appeared in many family scenes. Gradually painters all over Europe were portraying them. These Toy Spaniels had drooping ears, but otherwise the prettiest of them were unmistakably the same breed we have today. The dropped ear still survives in the variety known as the Phalene (“FAY-leen”), named for a moth that droops its wings, to distinguish it from the erect-eared modern variety: the Papillon or Butterfly dog.
With its unusual ears, waving tail plume, and flowing coat, the Papillon is a standout. It possesses what has been termed “sensible glamour” because the owner does not have to become a slave to preserve its beauty. The Papillon has no doggy odor and its silky coat is not prone to matting. However, Papillons love to be clean and bathing is easy; they wash like an orlon sweater! They have no dense undercoat to shed out twice a year as with most long-haired breeds and the resilient coat texture sheds dirt and dry grass with the touch of a brush. The pet Papillon requires no trimming of the coat, although the bottoms and sides of the feet can be trimmed for a more tidy appearance (this is usually done for the show ring).
The possibilities for color and markings are very nearly unlimited so you will find no two Papillons are exactly alike. For the show ring, the white color should predominate, with color covering both ears and extending over both eyes. Patches of color on the body may be of any size or shape, and of any color including black, tricolor, red, orange, tan, and sable. A symmetrical white blaze and noseband are preferred on the face but not essential for prize winning.
Their height at the top of the shoulder blade averages 8″ to 12″, with a corresponding weight of 4 to 10 pounds. This is the size range allowed in dog show competition, but smaller and larger individuals do occur infrequently. The delicate tinies can serve as exquisite companions for senior citizens, while the oversized ones with larger, stronger bones make delightful additions to active families with well-behaved children.
The Papillon is generally outgoing and friendly, although how extroverted it will be with strangers varies with how it was raised. Both males and females make equally suitable pets, and of course, should always be neutered or spayed if not destined for the dog show ring. Papillons are generally very social with other animals, and make wonderful companions to other dogs & and cats too. A word of warning though: they ignore all size differential and will entice much larger dogs to play, often with disastrous results. Their preference is to be with people, not only to be cuddled in a lap, but to accompany walks, car trips, TV watching, etc.
Papillons are active, lively dogs, although generally not nervous or yappy. They might alert you when someone is at the door but should quiet down immediately when that person has been admitted as a friend. Most Papillons retain their puppy playfulness to some degree throughout their lives. They travel well (carsickness is rare), and enjoy the attention they draw wherever they go. A Papillon can change homes at any age and if suitably placed, will adjust happily.
This is a relatively healthy breed. Although it cannot claim absolutely no genetic problems (no breed and no species of animal is entirely free of harmful genes) but in comparison with many breeds, the Papillon seems to have no serious problems widespread throughout the population. They are seldom finicky eaters but are not prone to obesity. Contrary to popular belief, they should not grow fat or change their personality after being spayed or neutered.
The Papillon is not considered to be a rare breed, although it is far from common. For 1988 it ranked 67th (among 129 breeds) with 1,209 new registrations with the American Kennel Club. With growing popularity, regrettably, increased numbers are being produced in “puppy mills” for distribution to pet shops. These puppies are raised in deplorable conditions, as cheaply as possible, and often from lines containing serious inheritable defects and questionable pedigree. Luckily, it is still mostly bred by knowledgeable fanciers devoted to protecting its interests and producing stock that is sound of mind and body.
The Papillon’s popularity also has grown at the dog shows because they are easy for novice exhibitors to groom and handle. They also are known to “show themselves” and will catch the judge’s eyes by dancing happily on the lead with ears held erect at attention and tail plume waving. Their “trainability” ranks extraordinarily high, enhanced by a strong desire to please; thus, they are rapidly becoming sought after as obedience competition dogs. In comparison to the more common large breeds found in the obedience trials, the Papillon’s small size, lively action, and intense attention to their handler always draw a crowd of spectators to ringside. It is one of five top breeds in obedience competition when all its scores and titles are factored in with its registration figures. It has been discovered that the Papillon has exceptional abilities in tracking (following a human scent) and agility (maneuvering a canine obstacle course). The breed also is ideal for service as Hearing Ear Dogs for the deaf and hearing impaired and therapy dogs (visiting hospitals and nursing homes).
It is often said that the Papillon is a big dog in a little dog’s body. They can do virtually all that a larger dog can do, but with less effort, upkeep, and space requirements. Truly, their unique beauty goes far beyond their glorious “butterfly” ears.


Small dog and small child, what could be cuter, right? Except the reality is that it rarely works out. Papillons are typically not a good choice for a household with very small children, or older children who want to be able to “roughhouse” with a dog, because of their small size. This breed also tends to have pretty high self-esteem; a Papillon will protect itself if it feels threatened or mistreated. While your kids are definitely angels and would never mistreat any animal, any home with a dog and children requires lots of extra commitment and constant supervision by the adults in the household to ensure that everyone treats each other responsibly. We find that when people add a Papillon to a household with children, the parents usually have a dog and have kids, but the kids don’t have a dog. Please consider this if you’re searching for a child’s pet or a family pet.

Papillons generally do well with other pets, especially other small dogs. Because they are small and fine-boned, Papillons can easily be injured or even killed by a large dog that views them as prey, is active and energetic, or just unintentionally steps on or stumbles over a Pap. If you have other larger dogs in your household now, please assess the situation realistically when considering adding a 5- to 12-lb member to your canine pack. Experience and commitment to close supervision and/or segregation is required when managing a multiple-dog household with any size disparity, to ensure everyone’s safety and longevity.
Papillons and cats generally share households quite well and can even become fast friends and playmates. However, cat’s claws may represent a danger to Papillon eyes, so initial contact should always be supervised.

Originally bred as companions for noblewomen: Papillons originated in Europe and were produced as early as the 1300s by crossing toy breeds with spaniels. You can even spot them in classic paintings by renowned artists like Rembrandt.
Initially known as dwarf spaniels, they were named Papillon in the 1800s — meaning butterfly in French — after their signature alert ears that resemble wings. However, they weren't always this way: Papillons before this time had dropped ears, but both varieties can be seen today.
In today's world, the breed is renowned for its loving nature and is a popular choice among first-time owners. Despite being lap dogs, they have a lot of energy and love to explore, making great pets for many types of households.
Find out everything you need to know about this breed with our in-depth guide.

In 2022, the average cost to insure a Papillon with ManyPets was £414.42. Our average dog insurance cost for all our breeds was £412.25, so Papillons are very close to our overall average.
Papillons are smart dogs that are eager to please their owners, which makes training relatively easy. Thanks to their intelligence, they love to learn new tricks and can even be trained to participate in obedience competitions.
Similar to other toy breeds, they do have a stubborn streak. However, with a little patience and consistency, they’ll soon learn to follow instructions.
Breed bad habits
Papillons are companion dogs, so they can develop separation anxiety when not given the attention they crave or when left alone for long periods. Because of this, they can resort to destructive behavior like excessive barking or chewing things around the home.
Although they're small dogs, they often believe themselves the alpha, so they may attempt to assert dominance with other dogs outdoors if they feel threatened. This can put them at risk of injury — especially if the dog is bigger than them.
As alert dogs, they're also quick to bark at strangers approaching the house or unfamiliar noises outdoors. Although this isn't usually aggressive, it can be a problem with neighbours, so socialising them with other dogs and people early on can help reduce this.
“Since Papillons love to please their owners, I find positive reinforcement training works best, rewarding good behaviour with treats and praise,” says professional dog trainer.
“Like many toy dogs, Papillons have small bladders so house training can be difficult. The trick is to let them out often and reward them when they go to the toilet outside to reinforce good behaviour. Although they still need to go outside to be exercised, they also do great with potty pad training, making them the perfect breed for apartment living.
Papillons like to be the leader of the park, which can result in barking at other dogs in the household — or even their owner — to assert dominance. This shouldn’t be an issue, though, if your pup is trained well and socialised from a young age.”
Although gender does have an impact on temperament, how they have been trained and socialised as a pup will be more of a determining factor.
You’ll also be able to tell the sexes apart by size, with males being slightly bigger and heavier.
Female Papillons tend to be more independent compared to their male counterparts. This means they’re often less eager to please their owner and can have more of a stubborn streak, which can make training trickier.
Height: 20-25 cm
Weight: 2-5 kg
Size: Small
Male Papillons are generally considered more affectionate than females: they tend to follow their owners and love to be carried like a baby.
Overall, they tend to be more of a people pleaser, making training easier. For this reason, they’re often chosen over females for obedience competitions.
Height: 23-28 cm
Weight: 3-5 kg
Size: Small
Healthy Papillons live for an average of 14 to 16 years.
The most common health problems that Papillons are prone to include:
Patellar luxation — This condition is usually genetic and involves the dislocating of the knee cap. Small or toy dogs — like Papillons — are particularly prone to a luxating patella, as they often have shallow knee grooves that don’t hold the kneecap firmly in place. Symptoms usually develop before one year of age, and if you notice your pup limping or running on three legs at times, it may be time for a trip to the vet. Treatment will depend on your dog’s condition: mild cases can be managed with exercises to build up the muscle, while severe cases may require surgery. Most dogs with the condition develop arthritis later in life, so it's important to schedule regular check-ups with your vet.
Collapsing trachea — Like many small breeds, Papillons are prone to a collapsed trachea due to their small windpipe. The condition can cause respiratory issues, resulting in wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Breathing will be more difficult for overweight pups, as they tend to have excessive fat around their neck. Collapsed trachea is also hereditary, so getting your dog from an experienced breeder will limit the risk of it being passed on. Weight loss, treatment, and walking in a harness will alleviate the problem. However, surgery may be required in severe cases to manage the symptoms.
Von Willebrand’s disease — Von Willebrand’s disease is an inherited disorder that affects Papillons. It’s caused by the lack of a protein (Von Willebrand’s factor) which assists the critical process of blot clotting. Symptoms include nosebleeds, excessive bleeding after injury, and bruising easily. Sadly, the condition is incurable, but life-long treatment can increase the protein in the blood to lessen symptoms. It shouldn’t affect your dog’s life expectancy, but you must keep an eye on bleeding; this could result in death if not given immediate attention.
Cataracts — Toy breeds like Papillons are prone to developing cataracts: a disease which causes the eye to become cloudy, impairing vision. It can be genetic or caused by old age or diabetes, and the only way to solve the issue is to remove cataracts with surgery.
Periodontal disease (dental disease) — Toy breeds like Papillons are prone to dental disease, as their small mouths can cause teeth overcrowding. This can lead to food getting lodged in the teeth and bacteria forming in the mouth that causes inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). If the problem is not dealt with, tartar can form, which will eventually require surgical removal.
“Papillons are generally a healthy breed that live a long life,” says Dr. Kirsten Ronngren, DVM MRCVS.
“There are a few health conditions to be aware of, including periodontal disease and patellar luxation. Taking your Papillon to the vet for a general health exam at least once a year, even if there aren’t any problems you’re aware of, is an easy way to catch teeth or knee problems.
Weight gain in Papillons is also something to take seriously, as obesity can worsen conditions like collapsing trachea or joint disease. To reduce this risk, limit treats and make sure not to leave food around. Your vet can also help with dietary advice to keep track of calories, including snacks in moderation!”
There are currently two variations of Papillons: the Papillon and the Phalene. The Papillon, meaning butterfly in French, has alert ears resembling the wings and the Phalene, meaning moth, has dropped ears that look similar to a moth's folding wings at rest.
The breed originally had dropped ears, though Papillons with upright ears are more common today.
The standard colours for Papillons include:
White
Sable
Black and white
White and chocolate
Fawn and white
Red and white
Papillons are particoloured dogs with patches of colour on their mainly white body.
Like any dog, Papillons need regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet to help them thrive.
Typical of lap dogs, Paps love companionship, so they are best suited to owners with plenty of time on their hands to care for them. Lack of attention can result in separation anxiety, often leading to bad behaviour.
Although Papillons are a small breed, they are more active than the average toy dog. They need a few walks daily, lasting around 20 to 30 minutes each. Shorter walks multiple times a day is best for this toy breed, as too much exercise can affect their joints, especially when they’re young.
As energetic and lively dogs, they’ll also enjoy playtime to stimulate them both mentally and physically. They also like to run outside, often reaching up to 18mph when sprinting, so a park near your home would be ideal.
You may need to put your pup in a jumper or jacket during the winter months to keep them warm. They have a single-layer coat, so they don’t tolerate the cold too well.
How much food your Papillon needs will depend on their size, weight, and activity level throughout the day. However, high-quality, protein-rich foods, healthy fats, and vegetables will provide them with the best nutrients.
Papillons can quickly become overweight, and it’s easy to overfeed, so try not to leave food out that they may graze on all day. Limiting treats can also prevent weight gain.
Building a balanced diet on your own can be tricky, so consult your vet to ensure your pooch’s nutritional needs are being met.
Adult Papillons need 12 to 16 hours of sleep daily to keep them happy and healthy. However, puppies will sleep around 18-20 hours as they develop and grow.
Papillons tend to stick to a similar sleeping schedule as their owners. If their sleeping pattern changes significantly, it may be a good idea to take them to the vet, as this could indicate something is wrong.
“The correct balance of exercise, nutrition, and sleep is critical to ensure your Papillon lives a healthy life,” says Dr. Kirsten.
“Making sure you’re not overwalking your pup is also essential. Although Papillons have a lot of energy, walking too much can quickly put stress on their joints.”
Papillons are generally confident, happy dogs with a lot of love to give. As well as being great lap dogs, they also love to play and run around.
Papillons are lively dogs, making them great companions for kids.
However, they are relatively delicate dogs, so they should be watched around children, as picking them up and dropping them could easily break their small bones.
Papillons are notoriously known as great companions who love affection. Once they've finished playing and running around, you'll often find them asleep in their owner's arms.
Despite their size, Papillons make excellent watchdogs, alerting owners to anything going on outside. They are usually territorial of their home and owners, often barking at strangers or other dogs approaching.
Although they may bark initially, Papillons can be friendly towards other dogs, especially if they’ve been socialised well from a young age.
Papillons are a friendly breed that can live with other pets — even cats! In fact, getting another friend for your pup may help with their separation anxiety when you’re not home.
Papillons were originally bred to be lapdogs and love human companionship, so they need lots of attention. Therefore, they may not be suited to people who don’t have the time for them.
The Papillon has a straight, long, single-layer coat that is silky in appearance.
Papillons are a low-shedding breed, and brushing them regularly should keep this at bay.
Unlike other long-haired breeds, your Papillon's coat doesn't matt easily, making grooming simple. Brushing a couple of times a week should be enough to keep it intact.
Papillons are clean dogs that don't usually smell, so bathing will only be required if they get muddy. If you need to bathe them, blow dry their hair afterwards for a silky finish.
You'll need to trim their nails every two weeks as they tend to grow fast and can pierce into the skin if not taken care of. Nails that make a tapping noise on the hard floor will let you know they’re too long and need to be trimmed.
Toy breeds are also susceptible to dental disease, so regularly brushing their teeth will prevent plaque buildup.
Papillons have a lot of hair around their ears, so you'll need to check them at least once a week for debris and wax to reduce the risk of infection.
These tasks can be done at home with the right tools, or you can take your furry friend to the vet to get everything done at once.
No — Papillons are not hypoallergenic. Dander in the hair can spread around the house, causing a reaction in people who are allergic. That being said, they don’t shed much, so they may be a good option for people who are mildly allergic.
Like most toy breeds, Papillons are vocal dogs that use barking to communicate with their owners and other dogs. Although small, their bark is considerably loud: something to be aware of if you have neighbours nearby.
A Papillon's bark is usually short and high-pitched, but they can also use growling to warn people or other dogs.
They are an alert breed that often barks as someone approaches their home, making them excellent watchdogs. This isn't usually in an aggressive manner; they're just letting you know that something is going on.
Papillons have strong senses and can let you know of any movement outside — even people walking along the street. Although this is in their nature, excessive barking can be a problem, so training from a young age and rewarding your dog when they don't bark will reduce this.
Papillons are relatively easy to care for: they require little exercise and are low maintenance when it comes to grooming. Training should also be easy, thanks to their intelligence and eagerness to please. Therefore, they’re a popular choice for first-time owners.
However, lap dogs love spending time with their owners and can develop separation anxiety if left alone for too long. Therefore, they won’t be suitable for owners with little time to give them.

On average, Papillons will reach their adult size between 9 and 12 months.
Papillons make excellent lap dogs and love to cuddle — especially when tired after a day of playing and exercise.

The Papillon, a spirited and playful small dog breed, descended from toy breeds and spaniels. Originally from France, these charming pups are named for their butterfly-like ears. Largely popular throughout the Renaissance, were often depicted in paintings from the 16th century. Although small in size, these dogs are highly active and excel in agility and obedience competitions.
Papillons’ sparkling personalities make them a favorite of everyone who meets them. Contrary to popular belief, these dogs are not lap dogs. They are active and playful, and they will not be content to lounge on the couch all day. However, they do love companionship and will always try to be where their humans are. If you are away from home for long hours of the day, this is not the breed for you. But if you can meet their needs, you will have a loving companion who will never want to leave your side.
When considering a Papillon dog, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a dog in need. However, if you decide to purchase a Papillon puppy, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their dogs. Reputable Papillon breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their dogs, conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the puppies. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy pup while discouraging unethical breeding practices.

Looking for the best dog for your apartment? Contrary to popular belief, the suitability of dogs who adapt well to apartment living goes beyond its size. Apartment dwellers have a myriad of dog breeds to choose from as potential companions, with various factors to consider. Some large breeds can adapt well to apartment living and have lower activity levels. Others may require more space and possess higher energy levels. On the other hand, certain small dog breeds with abundant energy can still find contentment with indoor playtime or brisk walks.


However, when selecting a dog that adapts well to apartments, it is essential to prioritize your neighbors. Opting for a pet that doesn’t excessively bark and behaves politely when encountering others in shared spaces is crucial. In apartment settings, it’s worth noting that numerous small dogs may exhibit a propensity for high energy and frequent barking. This can make them less suitable for apartment living. Rather than size alone, you’ll want to think about breeds who are quiet, low-energy, and sociable towards other residents.




Regardless of your pup’s inherent suitability to apartment living, you will want to invest in additional training to help them be their best selves. Training dogs not inherently suited to apartment living requires extra patience and consistency. Start by establishing clear boundaries and rules within your apartment to create a structured routine for your dog. Focus on basic obedience commands such as “sit”, “stay”, “come”, and “leave it”. Barking-related training commands including “hush” or “quiet” are also crucial. This training is essential for managing your dog’s behavior both indoors and outdoors.


Since space may be limited, prioritize leash training to ensure your dog walks calmly and obediently, especially in communal areas. Crate training can also help your dog feel safe and secure while you’re away from your apartment. This may help your pup avoid anxiety, which could lead to barking habits.

When considering adding a dog to your home, it’s important to acknowledge that some dog breeds may present less of a challenge in terms of training and temperament. These dogs tend to be more adaptable, responsive to training, and resilient, readily overcoming any training hiccups or inconsistencies. As one might expect, these breeds may be good for novice dog owners.


Conversely, certain dogs may pose greater difficulties, particularly for first-time owners. Factors such as heightened sensitivity, independence, energy levels, or assertiveness can contribute to a more demanding ownership experience. Novice dog owners should assess their level of experience and comfort when selecting a new pet, ensuring compatibility with their lifestyle and capabilities for a mutually rewarding relationship.






For first-time or novice dog owners, pet ownership can be both exciting and daunting. As a bit of advice, research breeds thoroughly before bringing a dog home. Each breed has their unique traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Consider factors such as size, exercise needs, grooming demands, and temperament to find a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences.


Prioritizing training and socialization at an early age is essential. You may want a breed who is more easy to train or perhaps possesses a lower energy level. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations early on lays the foundation for a well-behaved and well-adjusted dog. Basic obedience training such as teaching commands like sit, stay, and come, is crucial for effective communication and building a strong bond with your new best friend. Additionally, exposing your dog to various environments, people, and other animals helps prevent behavioral issues and promotes confidence and adaptability. Consistent care, patience, and love are key ingredients for a fulfilling and rewarding relationship with your dog.

Sensitivity levels in dogs vary widely among breeds and individuals. This trait can be determined by how a dog responds to their environment. While some dogs remain unfazed by stern reprimands or surrounding stimuli, others are more sensitive. Even the slightest disapproving glance or the sound of a passing car can affect a sensitive dog. Dogs with a low sensitivity level, also known as “easygoing,” “tolerant,” “resilient,” or “thick-skinned,” are better equipped to handle a bustling household, assertive owners, and unpredictable routines. If you have young children, frequently host social gatherings, engage in noisy activities like playing in a band, or live a busy, unpredictable life, a low sensitivity level dog may be the ideal choice for you.


Highly sensitive dogs are wired differently, with research indicating that their brains process sensory input more deeply. Evolutionarily speaking, scientists theorize high sensitivity levels could aid in survival by functioning as an early warning system, alerting the pack imminent danger. Sensitivity in dogs also includes how they interact with humans and other animals. Some dogs are naturally more sensitive, quickly picking up on subtle cues and changes in their surroundings. Others are more resilient and are able to brush off minor disturbances. Factors such as genetics, early socialization, and life experiences can all contribute to a dog’s sensitivity levels. Highly sensitive dogs may react strongly to loud noises, sudden movements, or changes in routine, while less sensitive dogs may remain calm and composed in similar situations. Being “highly-sensitive” doesn’t always only mean “highly anxious”. Highly-sensitive dogs may also be more empathetic, more affectionate, or serve as better guardians.









Helping highly sensitive dogs involves creating a calm environment, establishing predictable routines, and using positive reinforcement training techniques. Gradually expose them to new experiences while providing mental stimulation and regular exercise to reduce anxiety and boredom. Monitor their diet and health, offering emotional support and reassurance to help them feel secure and valued.

Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive–barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work. On the other hand, some breeds are instinctually more independent and easily tolerates being alone.


It’s essential to remember that individual dogs’ tolerance for being alone can vary greatly, depending on factors such as age, temperament, and training. Providing appropriate mental stimulation, toys, and a comfortable environment can help alleviate any potential distress when leaving these breeds alone.









When leaving your dog home alone, it’s essential to create a calm and comfortable environment for them. Even if your dog tolerates being alone, always make sure they have access to their favorite toys, bedding, and water. Consider leaving on soothing background noise, such as calming music or a white noise machine, to help drown out any outside sounds and provide a sense of security.


Before leaving, give your pup an energetic play session or walk to tire them out and alleviate any pent-up energy. Avoid making a big fuss when you leave or return to prevent reinforcing separation anxiety. Additionally, consider providing a special treat or puzzle toy to keep your dog occupied while you’re away, helping to distract them and make their alone time more enjoyable. You may also want to gradually increase the duration of your absences over time.

Several dog breeds are naturally equipped to tolerate cold weather and climates, thanks to their thick coats, sturdy builds, and unique adaptations. Some breeds from snowy climates and mountainous regions may immediately come to mind, like the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Renowned for their cold tolerance and ability to excel in snowy environments, these cold-weather breeds not only tolerate freezing temperatures but may be happiest in the chill. Thanks to dense double coats that provide excellent insulation against the cold, they have no trouble adapting when the temperatures drop.


Additionally, these dogs may have a higher body fat percentage have a built-in layer of insulation that helps retain body heat in cold weather. Physical attributes also play a role in cold tolerance, enabling dogs to navigate snowy or icy terrain with ease. Certain breeds may have specialized adaptations, such as furry feet for traction on slippery surfaces or water-resistant coats for protection against moisture and wind chill. Moreover, a dog’s natural instincts, such as seeking shelter or burrowing in the snow for warmth, can further enhance their ability to tolerate cold weather.

Unlike cold-weather breeds and brachycephalic dogs, certain dog breeds are well-adapted to warmer climate and tolerate hot weather with relative ease. Breeds such as the Chihuahua, Dalmatian, and Basenji have short coats and lean body structures that facilitate heat dissipation, allowing them to stay comfortable in warmer weather. Their minimal fur reduces the risk of overheating, and their efficient panting mechanisms help regulate their body temperature effectively. These breeds often enjoy basking in the sun and participating in outdoor activities even during hot days, although owners should still ensure they have access to shade and water to prevent dehydration.


Moreover, some breeds have evolved in regions with hot climates, equipping them with natural adaptations to thrive in warm weather conditions. These breeds have developed unique features such as hairless or short coats, as well as physiological traits that aid in heat tolerance. Their ability to cope with high temperatures makes them suitable companions for owners living in warm climates, although proper care and attention to hydration and sun protection are still essential to ensure their well-being during hot weather.









Even if your dog tolerates hot weather, it’s still important to prioritize safety. You can check out guidelines on assessing if the weather is too hot for your dog. Ensure your dog always has access to fresh water, provide shaded areas in your yard or outdoor space, and schedule outdoor activities during cooler times of the day to prevent overheating. Never leave your dog in a parked car, monitor for signs of heat exhaustion, and protect their paws from hot pavement. Consider using pet-safe sunscreen on exposed skin areas and seek veterinary assistance if symptoms persist.

When it comes to unconditional love and unwavering loyalty, few animals can rival the affectionate nature of dogs. These remarkable creatures have earned their reputation as man’s best friend, and it’s no wonder! Many breeds are particularly renowned for their love and devotion to their families. With their warm hearts and wagging tails, affectionate family dogs enrich the lives of their owners in countless ways.


While we like to think that all dogs are creatures of love, some breeds may be more outwardly affectionate than others. Some of this is due to temperament, breed group, and purpose. For example, dogs first bred for working or guarding independently of their human companions may show less affection than dogs specifically bred to be companion animals. Of course, this is no indication of the bond between a human and pup, but rather related to temperament and breed origin.


Affection may be demonstrated through a myriad of heartwarming behaviors. This may including tail-wagging greetings, cuddles on the couch, and an ever-present eagerness to be by their family’s side. This devotion extends to both adults and children, making dogs wonderful additions to family households. The warmth of a dog’s affection not only provides emotional support but also creates an environment of joy and connection within the family, fostering a sense of togetherness.




The affectionate nature of family dogs extends beyond play and cuddles. Dogs have a remarkable ability to sense their owner’s emotions, offering comfort and support during difficult times. Whether it’s a wagging tail after a long day at work or a sympathetic nuzzle during moments of sadness, they prove time and again that they are attuned to their family’s needs.


It is important to note that not all dogs of the same breed will be equally affectionate. Some dogs may be more independent or aloof, while others may be more clingy or demanding of attention. The best way to find out how affectionate a dog is is to meet them in person and interact with them.

If you’re looking for a pup to join your household, you may first want to consider the most kid-friendly dog breeds. A gentle nature, patience, and the sturdiness to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs children can dish out can be some of the most kid-friendly dog-defining traits. Of course, a pup with a blasé attitude toward running and screaming children would be a bonus.


At first glance, you may be surprised by the most kid-friendly dogs. Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers, an affectionate Pit Bull breed. Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren’t always so family-friendly.


It’s important to note all dogs are individuals. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual dog will behave. Dogs from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences. Additionally, training plays a big role in how dogs will get along with kids. No matter what the breed or breed type, all dogs have strong jaws,  pointy teeth, and may bite under stressful circumstances or mishandling. Young children and dogs of any breed should always be supervised by an adult and never left alone without supervision.






Determining if a dog is kid-friendly involves assessing various aspects of their temperament, behavior, and breed characteristics. A kid-friendly dog should display a gentle and calm demeanor, showing an ability to handle the unpredictable behaviors and noises associated with children. Additionally, behavioral signals like wagging tails and a relaxed body language often indicates a positive interaction with kids.


Breed tendencies also play a role in gauging kid-friendliness. Some breeds are inherently more predisposed to be good with children. It’s essential to consider the dog’s personality, socialization history, and any signs of anxiety or discomfort. A well-socialized dog that has positive experiences with children is more likely to be kid-friendly, regardless of their breed. Conducting meet-and-greet sessions under controlled circumstances and observing the dog’s reactions to children’s actions can provide valuable insights into their suitability for family life.

Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may intimidate other dogs, even if they’re love-bugs with people; others are naturally more dog friend and would rather play than fight. It’s important to note that breed isn’t the only factor when it comes to how dog-friendly your pup will be. Sure, some dogs breeds first bred for working independently may not immediately gravitate towards other dogs, but early socialization plays a lot more into how dogs will interact than their origin.  Dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least six to eight weeks of age or who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood are more likely to have good canine social skills.


Still, some dog-friendly breeds are more pack-oriented and naturally thrive with other dogs. Dogs with this trait typically exhibit an innate ability to get along well with other pups. Dogs with this trait may be more eager to greet new dogs, display more social behavior at places like dog parks, or more confidently allow intimate sniffs from their canine acquaintances. This quality extends beyond mere tolerance and often manifests as a genuine enjoyment of the company of fellow canines, making these dogs ideal companions for those looking to build a multi-dog household. Additionally, they’ll pair well with pet parents hoping to take their pooch on social adventures, such as going to dog park or hanging out on dog-friendly patios.






While some dog breeds are more naturally inclined to make friends with other dogs, you may choose a puppy or adult dog that needs a little help. It’s may be common knowledge that there is a small window during a puppy’s early development when they are the most adaptable in terms of how they’ll interact with other dogs. You may, however, bring home an adult dog or a rescue and not get the opportunity. Not to fear! There are still many ways to help your pooch become dog-friendly.


Socialization is always the best way to ensure your dog becomes their most friendly self. You can help by exposing your pooch to as many sights, sounds, and environments as possible. Set up doggy playdates, enroll in dog training classes, or visit the dog park. Of course, be sure to do your research on dog training methods to ensure your dog will listen to you in social settings. Confidence is key!

Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with wagging tails and nuzzles; others are shy, indifferent, or even reserved. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was socialized and exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a puppy will respond better to strangers as an adult. Remember that even friendly dogs should stay on a good, strong leash in public.


However, it’s worth noting that certain breeds might initially appear more reserved or aloof when encountering new people. Some individuals appreciate this quality, as not everyone seeks a highly sociable canine companion. There is a preference for the calm and composed personalities exhibited by specific breeds. It’s essential to recognize that not all breeds necessarily need to be inherently friendly with strangers; however, it is crucial that your pup is not aggressive or reactive in such situations.

When considering adding a pup into your home, you may want to consider the amount of shedding your furry companion will experience. Regardless of the dog breed, you will want to be prepared for at least some amount of pet hair on your clothing and around your house. Of course, this amount can vary greatly as shedding tendencies differ significantly among breeds. Some dogs shed continuously, especially dog breeds with heavy double-coats or long fur. Others undergo seasonal “blowouts” and some hardly shed at all.


Having a set of grooming tools at your disposal is essential for tending to your dog’s coat. Deshedding tools are excellent for eliminating excess hair that can become trapped in your dog’s fur. There are also brushes designed to gently remove dead hair without causing discomfort to your dog’s skin. Grooming gloves and bathing brushes can aid in loosening dead hair during shampooing, making it easier to brush away. Clippers and a detangling spray effectively tackle matted fur. Additionally, home tools for managing pet hair on fabric and furniture can make a big difference. Pet tape rollers, fur brooms, and specialized vacuums can eliminate pet hair from carpet, clothing, and even furniture.


If you’re someone who values a spotless environment, you might want to opt for a low-shedding breed. Otherwise, equip yourself with the right tools to fight the fur. Concerns about shedding shouldn’t prevent you from relishing your time at home with your dog. Establishing a consistent grooming regimen can significantly minimize the presence of loose hair in your living space and on your clothing. For additional guidance on managing dog shedding, explore our recommendations for addressing excessive shedding and designing your home with your pet (and their shedding tendencies) in mind.

Often referred to as “heavy droolers,” some slobbery dog breeds are known for their drooling potential. This trait is more prevalent in certain breeds with loose, jowly skin. A few breeds that may come to mind when thinking about dog drool are Saint Bernards, Bloodhounds, and Mastiffs. Drooling is a natural behavior influenced by factors like genetics, breed characteristics, and individual anatomy. Even among breeds with a higher drooling potential, some dogs may drool very little while others may drool a lot.


While some dogs may only drool more during specific activities like eating or in anticipation of food, others may be consistent heavy droolers due to their inherent physiological makeup. Living with a dog that drools requires a degree of acceptance and proactive management. Pet owners of drooling breeds often keep absorbent towels or bandanas on hand to wipe away excess saliva. This may be particularly necessary after meals or playtime. Regular dental care can also contribute to reduce excessive drooling by addressing potential oral health issues. Despite the occasional mess, many pet owners of drooling dogs appreciate their unique charm.


Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you’ve got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you’re not a fan of the extra slime, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department.






Owners with slobbery dog breeds should establish a baseline for their dog’s normal drooling levels. There may be instances where excessive drooling indicates an underlying issue rather than typical breed behavior. Excessive drooling in dogs can serve as an indicator of potential underlying issues. Various factors, such as stress, high temperatures, dental problems, allergic reactions, or nausea, may contribute to increased drooling. If your dog usually isn’t very slobbery or if additional concerning symptoms accompany sudden and pronounced drooling, it is advisable to consult with a veterinarian. Keeping track of what is typical for your dog allows you to quickly identify deviations from the norm and address potential health concerns or discomfort.

Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Easy-to-groom dogs are a smart choice for pet owners looking for a low-maintenance companion. Breeds with short coats or those that shed minimally often fall into the category of easy-to-groom dogs. Of course there are exceptions to this statement. For example, allergy-friendly, low-shedding Poodles or Poodle Mixes like the Labradoodle or Bernedoodle require frequent grooming. Low-maintenance dog breeds require less frequent brushing sessions. These pups may be more convenient for individuals with busy schedules or those looking for a hassle-free pet care routine.


Owners of low-maintenance dogs also enjoy the benefit of reduced grooming-related expenses. Because these breeds typically don’t require professional services, these low-maintenance breeds end up being more budget-friendly. Common examples of easy-to-groom breeds include Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. While regular grooming remains essential for all dogs, the easy-to-groom breeds offer a practical option for pet parents seeking a dog without the added demands of intricate care routines. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs a lot of grooming. Alternatively, you may want to consider the budget required to pay someone else to do it.






Beyond the usual brushing, clipping, and trimming needs, some breeds require additional grooming for their unique needs. Breeds such as Pugs and Shar-Peis have loose skin and wrinkles that require extra vigilance during bathing.


First, to prevent grime and even bacteria from becoming a problem, clean between the folds of their skin with damp cotton and then dry well. Keeping these areas dry is also important after a bath or a walk in the rain. Long, droopy-eared pups like the Basset Hound or Cocker Spaniel must be checked weekly for buildups of wax and dirt. A cotton wad with a little water or mineral oil can help keep the ears clean and dry. Drops specifically designed to clean and dry the canal should also be applied for these ear infection-prone dogs. Hair that grows around the canal entrance should be kept trimmed. You can check with a professional groomer or veterinarian for instructions on how to properly and safely do this. Special tools may be available for this unique task.

While most dogs experience good general health, some breeds may be prone to specific health issues. Conditions like hip dysplasia, cancer, or heart conditions can result from poor breeding practices or genetic dispositions. However, it’s important to note that not every dog of a particular breed will necessarily develop these diseases. Rather, they only face an elevated risk compared to other breeds.


When considering adding a dog or puppy to your home, it’s advisable to research the prevalent genetic illnesses associated with the breed you’re interested in adopting. Additionally, it can be beneficial to inquire whether your chosen shelter or rescue organization possesses information regarding the physical health of the potential pup’s parents and other relatives. This knowledge can aid in understanding potential health risks and ensuring the best possible start for your new furry family member.









The CHIC (Canine Health Information Center), a program created by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), provides a centralized database for canine health information, particularly focusing on orthopedic and genetic conditions. Despite robust general health, they recommend several health screenings for breeds due to potential predispositions to certain conditions. After screening, the CHIC assigns a number to a dog’s test results. It doesn’t indicate normal results, just that all necessary tests were done and results made available. A CHIC report accompanies the number, detailing the tests, the dog’s age during testing, and the results.


The CHIC program adjusts its requirements based on evolving breed health concerns. Existing CHIC numbers aren’t affected if requirements change. This number is also displayed on AKC documents, including Certified Pedigrees, Registration Applications, and Registration Certificates. This record signifies to potential puppy parents and breed enthusiasts that recommended tests have been completed. Although the CHIC database only includes purebred dogs, you can look up a hybrid breed’s parent breeds for potential health considerations.

Certain dog breeds have a predisposition towards hearty appetites. As a result, they may also be prone to weight gain, similar to humans. Just like in people, obesity in dogs can lead to various health issues. If you opt for a breed prone to packing on pounds, it’s essential to implement strategies to manage their weight effectively. This includes limiting treats, ensuring they receive sufficient exercise, and regulating their daily food intake by serving measured meals instead of leaving food accessible all day.


Consulting with your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is crucial. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your pet’s specific needs to help maintain a healthy weight. Weight gain not only poses direct health risks but can also exacerbate existing conditions such as arthritis, leading to further complications if left unchecked. Thus, proactive management of your dog’s weight is integral to their overall well-being and longevity.






To help your dog manage weight gain, start by consulting with your veterinarian to develop a safe and effective weight loss plan tailored to your pet’s individual needs. This may involve adjusting their diet to a lower calorie option or a specialized weight management formula. It may also include measuring their food portions to control calorie intake, and reducing the frequency of treats. Additionally, increasing their physical activity through regular exercise is essential for burning calories and promoting weight loss.


Identifying whether your dog is overweight involves assessing their body condition and observing for signs of excess weight. You can perform a simple visual and tactile evaluation by feeling their ribs and observing their waistline. In a healthy weight dog, you should be able to feel their ribs easily with a slight covering of fat. They should have a noticeable waist when viewed from above. If your dog is overweight, you may observe visible signs such as a lack of a defined waist, a rounded or bulging abdomen, difficulty moving or breathing, or reduced energy levels.

Easy-to-train dogs have an innate ability to quickly understand the relationships between prompts, actions, and rewards. For example, when told to “sit,” easy-to-train dogs quickly associate the command with the action of sitting, knowing that compliance results in a positive outcome, such as receiving a treat. This ability to learn quickly makes training easier and more enjoyable for both the dog and the owner. On the contrary, some dogs may need more time, patience, and consistent repetition to form these associations, emphasizing the importance of tailoring training methods to individual learning styles.


It’s crucial to keep in mind that dogs that present challenges aren’t necessarily less intelligent; rather, they may exhibit a more independent nature shaped by their breeding history. Breeds like Livestock Guardian Dogs, for instance, developed an inherent independence due to their historical role in guarding flocks without constant human supervision. This independent spirit, while a unique and valuable trait, can pose challenges when it comes to imparting basic commands. Having been bred to think and act autonomously, they may require a bit more patience and understanding from their owners.






Training is essential to keep your dog safe in various situations, whether it’s staying within the yard or maintaining control during emergencies. The mental exercise from training helps keep your dog sharp, burn off excess energy, and minimize undesirable behaviors. Consistency and patience are key; reward your dog when they get it right. As the adage says, you can always teach an old dog new tricks.


No matter what you’re trying to teach your dog, from housetraining to “heel,” there are a few basic guidelines that can help make the process easier. Be sure to check out our feature on several of the most popular dog training methods. We also have articles on the basics of leash training for your pups.

Dogs Who Are Challenging To Train

Dogs exhibit a remarkable spectrum of intelligence, encompassing a wide array of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. From the astute problem-solving abilities of breeds like Border Collies to the keen observational skills of German Shepherds, canine intelligence manifests in various forms. Some dogs excel in tasks requiring social intelligence, such as understanding human emotions and cues. Other may showcase exceptional learning capacity in their ability to master complex commands and tasks. Additionally, certain breeds demonstrate remarkable memory retention and the ability to adapt to new situations swiftly. However, it’s essential to recognize that intelligence in dogs is diverse and multifaceted. Intelligence is influenced not only by genetics, but also by individual experiences and environmental factors.


Dogs bred for tasks requiring decision-making, intelligence, and focus, such as herding livestock, require mental stimulation akin to how dogs bred for endurance need physical exercise. Lacking such mental engagement, they may resort to activities like digging or chewing to occupy themselves. It’s worth noting that while intelligence is valued, it doesn’t always correlate with trainability, especially in breeds bred for independent thinking. Hello, Livestock Guardians! Incorporating obedience training, interactive toys, and engaging activities like dog sports or careers such as agility and search and rescue can provide the mental challenge these dogs crave.









Keeping your dog mentally stimulated is crucial for their well-being. One way to do this is through interactive play and toys. Treat-dispensing toys or puzzles that require problem-solving can keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged. Regularly rotating toys can also prevent boredom. Additionally, incorporating training sessions into your daily routine provides mental stimulation while strengthening your bond with your dog. Teaching new tricks or practicing obedience commands challenges their mind and keeps them sharp.


Another way to stimulate your dog mentally is through enrichment activities. This includes activities that engage their senses, such as hide-and-seek games using treats or scent trails. Taking your dog on different walking routes or exploring new environments introduces novelty and mental stimulation. Additionally, providing opportunities for social interaction with other dogs through playdates or visits to dog parks can stimulate their minds through socialization. Regularly changing up their environment and offering new experiences helps prevent monotony and keeps your dog mentally sharp and happy.

Mouthiness, a tendency to nip, chew, and playfully bite, is a common behavior in puppies across many dog breeds. For some breeds, the tendency persists into adulthood, particularly with sporting and herding breeds. Because of this inherent instinct in many breeds, mouthy dogs are more inclined to use their mouths to hold or “herd” their human family members. Of course, this isn’t always appreciated! They require training to learn that chewing on toys is acceptable, but not on people. Breeds with a higher potential for mouthiness often greatly enjoy interactive games like fetch, as well as chewing on toys stuffed with kibble and treats.




Puppy mouthing and nipping may seem cute initially, but it can develop into an unwanted habit as the dog matures, especially in breeds with a potential for mouthiness. It’s important to understand that in the early stages of a puppy’s development, biting and mouthing is one of the ways they begin to explore and understand their environment. These aren’t true bites, but rather the puppy using their mouth to sense and interact with its surroundings. Even so, it’s a good idea to teach your dog commands like “drop it” or “let go” from a young age. This will help curb the mouthing behavior before it becomes an entrenched problem in adulthood.






The best way to train your dog out of mouthiness is to teach them how to play with a gentle mouth. Whenever your dog puts their mouth on your skin, make a high-pitched yelp or squeal. This teaches them that biting hurts. As they learn that their bite causes discomfort, they’ll start to use less pressure. It’s crucial to help your dog understand that they may accidentally apply too much force, resulting in a painful bite. You’ll need to consistently use this technique until your dog only applies the lightest pressure, using just their gums, when engaging in playful mouthing behaviors.


The key is to show your dog that hard bites are unacceptable, so they learn to play more gently with a soft mouth. The yelping response reinforces this lesson over time, allowing your dog to develop more control and gentleness when playing with their mouth.CopyRetry

Dogs with a high prey drive have an instinctive desire to stalk, capture, and prey upon potential food sources. Dogs who were bred to hunt, such as Terriers, have an inborn desire to chase — and sometimes kill — other animals. Anything whizzing by — such as cats, squirrels, and perhaps even cars — can trigger that instinct.




Off-leash adventures are too great a temptation for pups who will wander and hunt. Dogs who like to chase need to be leashed. And, even on a leash, you may experience your dog pulling on the leash to reach rodents or birds in their sight. Otherwise, these pups should be kept in a fenced area when outdoors. If your pup has a high prey drive, you’ll need a high, secure fence in your yard.


These breeds generally aren’t a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won’t chase, but you’ll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by.




Observing your dog’s prey drive, which is instinctual and biologically-rooted, is not the same as observing aggression. Much aggression is born of fear and anxiety, especially in the case of dog aggression toward humans.


The tendency to wander, even into oncoming traffic, can produce diasterious results for pups with predatory instincts. It can also lead to pups being bitten by snakes or attacked by other wild animals they may pursue while on the hunt.

Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how often the dog vocalizes. Learn more about breeds with a tendency to bark or howl.


If you’re considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you’re considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious “strangers” put your pup on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby who may not be thrilled about the booming barks? Then you may wish to choose a quieter dog.









Training a dog with a tendency to bark or howl excessively requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement techniques. Begin by identifying the triggers that prompt your dog to bark, whether it’s the doorbell, passing cars, or other animals. Once you understand the underlying causes, work on desensitizing your dog to these stimuli through gradual exposure and counterconditioning. For example, if your dog barks at the doorbell, practice ringing the bell repeatedly at a low volume while rewarding calm behavior with treats or praise. Gradually increase the intensity of the stimulus while continuing to reward quiet responses, reinforcing the idea that remaining quiet brings positive rewards.


In addition to desensitization exercises, teach your dog an alternative behavior to replace barking, such as “quiet” or “speak.” Use these commands in training sessions to encourage your dog to bark on cue and then stop when prompted. Consistency is crucial, so ensure everyone in the household is on board with the training plan and reinforces the desired behavior consistently. Finally, provide mental and physical stimulation through regular exercise and interactive toys to help alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood of excessive barking.

Dogs possess a natural inclination for exploration and adventure, often displaying wanderlust tendencies that stem from their ancestral instincts. With their keen sense of smell and curiosity, dogs are drawn to new scents, sights, and experiences. As a result, they may be inherently prone to wander off if given the opportunity. This wanderlust potential varies across breeds, with some exhibiting stronger instincts for exploration than others. Breeds such as the Siberian Husky, Beagle, and Australian Shepherd are known for their independent spirits and high energy levels. They may be more likely to wander off in search of excitement or stimulation. However, even breeds typically considered more docile may still succumb to wanderlust if not properly trained or supervised.






To mitigate the risk of dogs wandering away, responsible pet ownership involves implementing preventative measures and training techniques. Providing adequate physical and mental stimulation through regular exercise, interactive play, and enrichment activities can help satisfy a dog’s innate desire for exploration and reduce the likelihood of wandering behavior. Having a general awareness of the “escape artist” tendencies in certain breeds can help you in ensuring the safety of your pup. Additionally, training commands such as recall and leash manners are essential for establishing boundaries and ensuring that dogs remain under control when outdoors. Investing in secure fencing for outdoor spaces and using identification tags or microchips can also provide added security and peace of mind in case of accidental escapes.

Energetic dogs, bred for specific tasks such as retrieving for hunters or herding livestock, are always ready for action and have enough stamina to work a full day. Additionally, active dogs with high energy levels necessitate a significant amount of physical and mental activity. These dogs enjoy jumping, playing, and discovering new sights and smells. Owners of high-energy breeds must provide outlets for their dogs’ physical and mental needs to keep them healthy and happy.


Low-energy dogs, on the other hand, are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to spend their days sleeping. When choosing a dog breed, you should consider your activity level and the energy level of your potential companion. Determine whether you would find certain dogs’ lively and energetic personalities invigorating or potentially overwhelming. Understanding a breed’s energy requirements is critical for ensuring a harmonious match between the dog’s needs and the owner’s preferences, resulting in a satisfying and balanced companionship.






Exercise requirements for high-energy dogs can vary even within the same breed. It’s also important to note that age doesn’t exempt senior dogs from exercise; they simply require shorter walks compared to their younger years. For energetic dogs, a leashed stroll around the block won’t be enough. The goal is to ensure that your dog is sufficiently tired and content by the time the exercise session concludes.


To meet the exercise needs of active breeds, it’s recommended to provide at least 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise most days. This applies not only to larger breeds but also to smaller ones. Some toy breeds are prone to obesity and may need more activity than one might assume. Safety is paramount, so during extreme weather conditions, it’s advisable to stay indoors and engage your dog’s mind through activities like trick training, interactive play with toys, or running up and down stairs together. A well-rounded exercise routine involves activities that challenge both mental and physical muscles, such as exploring new hiking trails. Check out our guide on the Top 10 Ways to Exercise With Your Dog.

A dog with high intensity exudes boundless energy and enthusiasm in everything they do, whether it’s pulling on the leash, tackling obstacles with gusto, or devouring meals with voracious appetite. While their exuberance can be endearing, it also necessitates consistent training to instill good manners. However, not everyone will appreciate their high energy levels. Some high intensity dogs may not pair well to households with young children or individuals who are elderly or frail, as their exuberance could inadvertently pose a risk.


In contrast, a low-intensity dog approaches life with a more relaxed and subdued demeanor. These dogs typically exhibit a calmer disposition, preferring leisurely strolls and gentle interactions over exuberant displays of energy. Their tranquil nature often makes them ideal companions for those seeking a more laid-back canine companion. This may be particularly true in homes where a quieter atmosphere is preferred.









Training and exercise are crucial for dogs with high-intensity personalities to manage their energy effectively. Consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques helps instill good manners and impulse control. Engaging them in mentally stimulating activities, alongside regular physical exercise like agility or fetch, is essential to prevent boredom-driven behaviors and promote overall well-being. Variety in their exercise routine, such as exploring new trails or participating in dog sports, ensures both physical and mental stimulation for a balanced and fulfilling life.

Different dog breeds have varying exercise needs, and understanding these requirements is crucial for ensuring a happy and healthy canine companion. Some breeds are content with a leisurely evening stroll around the block, while others demand daily, vigorous exercise routines, particularly those originally bred for physically demanding tasks like herding or hunting. Without sufficient physical activity, these high-energy breeds may face issues such as weight gain and express their pent-up energy in undesirable behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, and digging.


We often think of exercise only as a health issue, but it has significant day-to-day effects on a dog’s behavior as well. Dogs — particularly puppies and young dogs — have a lot of energy, and if they don’t get the chance to burn it off, destructive behavior is often the result. If you’re annoyed at your dog’s digging, have headaches from barking, and need to replace pillows shredded into expensive fluff, your dog is probably not getting enough exercise.






Generally speaking, a leashed walk around the block isn’t going to cut it. Most dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Your canine pal needs enough that they’re slowed down by the time you stop.


Some general guidelines for getting your dog enough exercise:

Understanding your dog’s temperament is crucial when considering their exercise and play needs. Some dogs have a high potential for playfulness, constantly seeking out games and activities to engage in. These playful pups can be endearing, but it’s essential to consider how much time and energy you have to dedicate to play each day. Think about whether you’re prepared for multiple rounds of fetch or tag and if you have other family members, kids, or even other dogs who can serve as playmates for your furry friend.


On the other hand, some dogs are more serious by nature. While they may still enjoy playtime, it might not be as frequent or vigorous as with their more playful counterparts. Understanding your dog’s individual temperament helps you tailor their exercise routine to suit their needs and preferences. It’s about finding the right balance between providing enough mental and physical stimulation without overwhelming them or neglecting their need for relaxation and downtime.









Playing with our pups is good for us. Seriously, science says so! To make the most of spending time with breeds with a high potential for playfulness, consider incorporating a variety of interactive games and toys to keep them mentally stimulated and physically active. Engage in activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek, which tap into their natural instincts and provide both mental and physical exercise. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to encourage good behavior and reinforce the bond between you. Remember to be patient and flexible, allowing your dog to lead the play session and adapt to their preferences. Finally, ensure a safe environment by removing any potential hazards and supervising closely, especially when introducing new toys or activities.

The Papillon, whose name comes from the French word for butterfly, is a portrait come to life, the modern representation of the small spaniels often seen in paintings from centuries past. The dwarf spaniel, as he was once known, has changed somewhat in appearance over the years, but he’s still the same wonderful companion who graced the laps of ladies and kings so many years ago.
The word papillon, meaning “butterfly,” refers to the breed’s fringed upright ears, which resemble a butterfly’s outspread wings. The breed also comes in a drop-eared variety called the phalene, which means “moth,” a cousin of the butterfly that folds its wings at rest. Both varieties can be born in the same litter, although the Papillon is the more popular and recognized variety.
While he might be categorized by size as a lap dog, the bright, busy, and curious Papillon is no shrinking butterfly. If you want a dog to sit on your lap while you watch television, he’s probably not the best choice. He’s more likely to be flitting around looking for something to do and will happily rid your home and yard of any small rodents that might be lurking there.
And this small dog in a sturdy package takes seriously his duties as family companion and guardian. He has a big-dog attitude and a level of alertness that makes him a super watchdog, but when it comes to protecting you it’s important to make sure he doesn’t bite off more than he can chew. He has no idea that he weighs only 4 to 9 pounds.
The Papillon is outgoing and energetic. He loves to be with people and is a happy dog who gives kisses freely to all. The Papillon’s small size makes him easy to handle, and his coat, while profuse, is easy to care for and doesn’t shed excessively.
His energy level ranges from moderate to intense, and being highly trainable he’s a great choice if you want to participate in dog sports such as agility or rally. Papillons are also excellent competitors in the obedience ring and are the number-one toy breed in obedience competition. All Papillon owners should attend obedience class if only to ensure that they don’t spoil their charming companions. Papillons can develop a stubborn streak if not shown early that such behavior will not be tolerated. On the plus side, their will to please and desire to succeed make them good at learning tricks or anything else a creative person can teach them. Papillons can even learn to pull a tiny cart and will proudly pull it in parades.
Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It’s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.
Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child’s hands and injure himself if he’s not being held correctly, and he won’t hesitate to defend himself if he’s being mistreated. No matter what the breed, dogs and children must always be supervised when they’re together.
This is a long-lived breed. It’s common for Papillons to live well into their teens, and if you’re considering purchasing one you should take that into consideration. The dog will be a member of your family for years to come.
A Papillon made breed history in 1999 when for the first time one took Best In Show at the Westminster Kennel Club show. The dog, Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being, or Kirby to his friends, also won the World Dog Show in Helsinki, Finland, and the Royal Invitational in Canada in 1998. This dog’s wins introduced the breed to many who had never seen or heard of the Papillon and has contributed to the breed’s rise in popularity.
Nonetheless, you won’t find a Papillon on every street corner. He’s not a rare breed, but he’s not common, either. Most breeders have a waiting list because Papillons tend to have small litters. The Papillon has been bred for centuries to be the ultimate companion. They are extremely people oriented and demand to be included in their person’s life at all times.
If you are looking for a lively, energetic, outgoing, and gregarious companion this could be the breed for you. You and your Papillon will live happily together for many years.
Overall, Papillons are wonderful dogs that make great companions for people of all ages. They are active, playful, intelligent, and loyal. If you are looking for a small, furry friend to add to your family, a Papillon is a great choice.
The Papillon was portrayed in portraits dating to the 16th century, a testament to the breed’s age and staying power. Rubens, Watteau, Boucher, Van Dyke, Rembrandt, and Fragonard all portrayed them in various artworks, usually accompanying their doting mistresses. The little spaniels were favorite companions of court ladies throughout Europe. Traders carried them in baskets on mules through France, Italy, and Spain.
The early toy spaniels from which the Papillon descended had drop ears, but in the 17th century court of Louis XIV a small spaniel with upright ears was developed and given the name Papillon for its resemblance to a butterfly. Other names by which the breed has been known over the centuries include Epagneul Nain (dwarf spaniel), Dwarf Continental Spaniels, Little Squirrel Dogs (because their full, plumed tail resembled that of a squirrel) or Belgian Toy Spaniels.
Besides the ears, the only other major change in the breed’s appearance was in color. Originally the little spaniels were solid-colored, but these days they’re white with patches of color. Otherwise, a Papillon today looks much the same as one you might see portrayed in a painting in the Louvre.
The drop-eared variety, known as the Phalene, still exists although he’s not as commonly seen. The Papillon ranks 35th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
Papillons stand 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder and weigh 4 to 9 pounds.
The Papillon is happy, alert, and friendly. He should never be shy or aggressive. This is, however, a take-charge little dog with a moderate to intense activity level. He’s very smart and highly trainable and is best described as a doer, not a cuddler. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization.
Like every dog, Papillons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they’re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Papillon pup grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Papillons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Papillons will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.
Papillons are housedogs and aren’t suited to living outdoors. They are active, however, and will enjoy having a yard where they can run in wild, fast circles. If that’s not available, however, they’ll make do with tearing through your house and jumping on and off the furniture. They are often described as mountain goats, so don’t be surprised if you find yours up on the kitchen table or some other high spot.
Adults need two or three 20- to 30-minute walks or playtimes per day, and they’ll appreciate more if you can provide it. Start puppies with two or three 10- to 15-minute walks and gradually increase the time and distance. Puppy or adult, they’ll let you know if they’re getting tired by stopping or sitting.
Although they grow up to be sturdy little dogs, Papillon puppies can be fragile. They can easily break a leg soaring off the back of the sofa or jumping off the bed, so try to avoid such situations by teaching them to use steps to get on and off furniture or waiting until you lift them down.
Papillons are easy to housetrain if you keep them on a schedule. Always take them out when they first wake up in the morning, after every meal, after naps, after playtime, after a grooming session or bath, and just before bedtime.
When you can’t supervise them, they should be crated or placed in a puppy-proofed room. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Papillon doesn’t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn’t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Papillon accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Papillon in a crate all day long, however. It’s not a jail, and he shouldn’t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he’s sleeping at night.
Papillons are people dogs, and they aren’t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Train your Papillon using positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and you will soon find that he can learn anything you can teach.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don’t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you’ll need to shake into your dog’s bowl.
It’s easy to overfeed a Papillon, but he has delicate knees and shouldn’t be allowed to get fat. Keep your Papillon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.
If you’re unsure whether he’s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can’t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Papillon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Papillon’s long, flowing coat is straight, fine, and silky, with no undercoat. Cascading down his chest is a frill of hair. His beautiful butterfly-like ears are fringed with hair, and the insides are covered with medium-length silken hair. Feathering covers the backs of the forelegs, and the hind legs are dressed in breeches, a fringe of longish hair on the thigh area, also known as culottes. Topping it all off is a long, flowing plume of a tail carried proudly arched over the body.
The Papillon is always parti-colored, white with patches of any color. On the head, any color other than white covers both ears back and front and extends without interruption from the ears over both eyes. The ideal Papillon has a clearly defined white blaze and nose band, but one with a solidly marked head still makes a great companion. The nose, eye rims, and lips are black.
The coat isn’t prone to matting but should be combed and brushed once or twice a week to distribute the natural skin oils and keep the hair and skin healthy. The Papillon doesn’t have a doggie odor, so bathe him only as needed. He’s a wash-and-go kind of dog.
Trim nails two or three times a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they’re too long. Small dogs are prone to periodontal disease, so start dental hygiene early. Brushing your Papillon’s teeth two or three times a week — daily if possible — will help keep them clean and tartar-free.
Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child’s hands and injure himself if he’s not being held correctly, and he won’t hesitate to defend himself if he’s being mistreated.
Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Papillon if they’re sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he’s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog’s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It’s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.
Papillons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Papillons in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don’t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Papillon rescue.
Finding a reputable dog breeder is one of the most important decisions you will make when bringing a new dog into your life. Reputable breeders are committed to breeding healthy, well-socialized puppies that will make great companions. They will screen their breeding stock for health problems, socialize their puppies from a young age, and provide you with lifetime support.On the other hand, backyard breeders are more interested in making a profit than in producing healthy, well-adjusted dogs. They may not screen their breeding stock for health problems, and they may not socialize their puppies properly. As a result, puppies from backyard breeders are more likely to have both health and behavioral issues.
