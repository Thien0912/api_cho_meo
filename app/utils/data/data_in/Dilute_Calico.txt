Most people have heard of calico cats, though not everyone knows what they are. These rare cats are exceptionally beautiful, which is the reason for their popularity. But there’s an even rarer type of calico that’s just as beautiful, though notably different in appearance: the dilute calico.
If you’ve never heard of a dilute calico before, you’re not alone. Even if you’ve heard of one, it’s very likely that you’ve never actually seen one in person due to their incredible rarity. But what is a dilute calico cat and what makes them so special? Dilute calicos have the same tri-colored coat that calicos have, but the dilute gene causes the colors to be muted and appear faded. Let’s take a look in detail.

A calico cat is a cat with a coat that displays three colors, with one of them being white. Most often, the other colors are black and orange. They’re prized for their gorgeous coats, but there’s a lot of misunderstanding surrounding these cats. Many people assume that calico is a breed, but it’s only a color pattern. This means that you can have calico cats in several breeds.
The coat of a calico cat features distinct patches of color with white being the base. Calicos are exceptionally rare, despite the fact that this coloring can appear in many breeds. Only 1 in 1,000 cats are born calico.

When thinking of dilute in relation to a cat’s coat, you can replace it with the synonym muted. Dilute calicos have the same tri-colored coat that calicos have, but the dilute gene causes the colors to be muted and appear faded. The orange will dilute to cream or strawberry-shaded blonde, and the black dilutes to gray or blue.
Dilute calicos are also called calamanco cats or clouded tigers.

You’ll often hear tortoiseshell and calico used interchangeably. While tortoiseshell and calico cats are very similar, they’re not actually the same thing.
Tortoiseshell cats also have tri-colored coats. However, the way that the colors present themselves is very different from a calico. Calico cats must have white as one of their colors and the other colors appear as patches over the white. Tortoiseshell cats don’t have white. Their colors are also blended and mixed instead of exhibiting specific patches of color.

As we mentioned, calico cats come in many breeds, though not all breeds can produce calicos. The breeds that can produce the calico coloring include:
American Bobtail
 American Curl
 American Longhair
 American Shorthair
 American Wirehair
 British Shorthair
 Cornish Rex
 Devon Rex
 Exotic
 Japanese Bobtail
 La Perm



It takes a very unusual chromosome pattern to create a calico cat. The X chromosome carries the genes for color. Females have two X chromosomes while males have just one. For a cat to become calico, it must have an X chromosome with orange coloring and another X chromosome with black coloring. Furthermore, they require an unrelated gene to introduce the white coloring.
Because it requires two X chromosomes to create a tri-color coat in a cat, generally speaking, males cannot display such a coat. However, 1 out of every 3,000 calico cats is born male due to a genetic anomaly known as Klinefelter syndrome. Because of this, male calicos are generally very unhealthy and sterile. Only 1 in 10,000 male calicos are fertile.
These cats have less bone mineral content, which means a greater risk of broken bones. Male calicos also tend to have behavioral problems due to mental development impairment. In addition, they hold more body fat, which can cause diabetes, heart disease, and continuous joint pain.

In many cultures, calico cats are thought to bring good luck. Considering how rare they are, this just might be true! After all, only 1 in 1,000 cats is born calico. But dilute calicos are even rarer, sporting faded colors that make the cat appear pastel. Though they have the genes for displaying the same colors as a standard calico, dilute calicos will display muted cream, strawberry-blonde, and grey instead of white, black, and orange.

They’re striking yet you don’t see too many of them so what is a dilute calico cat and how rare are they?
Calico cats are beautiful felines with their tri-color hues of orange, black and white but what is a dilute calico cat and how rare are they? In short, they are a paler, more pastel-like version. Their white fur has patches of light orange, charcoal gray and cream which are often blended, making them look particularly gorgeous. And the reason for their stark appearance is purely down to genetics.
A standard calico cat has one particular genetic code. A dilute calico cat has two. As you will see later in this exploration of dilute calico cats, it makes a big difference, giving the fur a more muted quality. Since there are very few dilute cats around, they’re also considered lucky in many world cultures. Have one of these cats in your home and your family, it is said, will be blessed with wealth and good fortune.
So let’s take a look at dilute cats in more detail. As you read on, you’ll discover why these cats are not tied to one particular breed and why some types are incredibly rare. In doing so you will come to appreciate just why they are among the world’s most prized felines.
So we’ve touched upon the reason why dilute calico cats exist but what genes are actually at play? In the case of a standard calico cat, the coloring is due to “X chromosome inactivation”, a genetic code found on the X chromosome is what gives the standard calico cat the distinct black and orange patches that they sport on their coat.
Dilute calico cats have the same genetic code but they also inherit the dilution gene from their parents. This gives them the same tri-color patterning as the standard calico but it is much softer in appearance. Any breed of cat has the potential to produce calico or dilute calico offspring, too.
Interesting fact: a standard female calico may carry the dilute calico gene without having turned out to be a dilute calico herself. If she partners with a rare male calico or any other male who carries the dilute calico gene, they can produce a dilute calico kitten.
Color, quite simply. Standard calico and dilute calico cats have a tri-color coat but the difference between them is the strength of the colors. A dilute calico cat's fur has much softer colors of gray-blue and cream, along with patches of white and a dilute calico cat can have a coat that is tinged with gold or silver colorings.

Since the dilute calico is named for its coat pattern and isn’t a breed in and of itself, there’s a fairly long list of cat breeds both short-haired and long-haired breeds that can produce beautiful tri-colored kittens. They include:
Yes. Only one in every 1,000 cats is born a standard calico and dilute calico cats are even harder to come by.
One of the reasons for this is that the dilution gene is what’s known as a recessive gene. That means that a more dominant gene can mask it and a kitten would need to inherit the dilution gene from both parents to be born a dilute calico.
Because the dilution gene is recessive and can be overridden by a dominant gene, it’s also very hard to specifically breed dilute calico cats so, consider yourself very lucky indeed if you become the pet parent to one of these beauties.
Most calico cats are female and males are extremely rare. In fact, given that 99.9% of all calico cats are female and only one in every 1,000 cats born is a standard calico, you can imagine how scarce male dilute calicos are!
The same genetic code that produces the beautiful coat color of the standard and dilute calico cats is also what determines their gender. Female cats have two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. This means that male cats can display either the black or orange gene but not both.
However, in extremely rare cases, known as Klinefelter Syndrome, a calico cat may be given an extra X chromosome which would then produce a male calico. On top of that, they would also need to inherit the dilution gene to be a male dilute calico.

Welcome to the captivating world of dilute calico cats, where nature’s palette softens to hues of dreamy grays and gentle creams, intertwined with splashes of pristine white. These cats are not just visually appealing but also carry a rich history and genetics that captivate cat lovers.
Whether you’re an experienced cat owner, considering a new furry friend, or simply admire cats, this article dives into the essentials of dilute calico cats.
Explore their unique appearance, coat colors, and what makes them different from vibrant calicos. Discover the charm of dilute calico cats and maybe find your next feline companion.
Inside This Article
At first glance, a dilute calico cat might simply seem like a lighter version of the vibrant calico we’re more familiar with. And in essence, that’s exactly what they are—but this softer color palette is due to an added genetic twist.
Dilute calicos have a tri-color coat made up of softer colors of gray-blue (sometimes called blue), creamy white, and patches of light orange, thanks to the presence of the dilution gene.
This specific genetic makeup alters the density of pigment granules in their fur, creating a “watered-down” or diluted appearance compared to the standard calico’s richer, darker tones.
The key to understanding a dilute calico’s distinctive appearance lies in its genetics, specifically the presence of the dilution gene. This gene alters the concentration and distribution of pigment granules within the fur.
In non-dilute cats, pigment granules are densely packed, giving rise to deep, rich colors. The dilute gene, however, causes these granules to spread out, creating a muted effect. This gene affects both the black and orange pigments, transforming black into gray and orange into cream.
Genetically, for a cat to have a dilute calico pattern, they must carry two copies of the dilute gene—one from each parent—making the trait recessive.
Since the dilution gene affects whatever color the cat would ordinarily display, it essentially ‘softens’ the standard calico cat’s colors into the diluted variant.
Calico isn’t a breed but a color pattern that can appear in many cat breeds. A fairly long list of cat breeds can produce calico kittens, both standard and dilute, including but not limited to:
Essentially, any cat breed capable of the calico coat pattern can potentially have dilute calico kittens.
Calico and tortoiseshell cats are often mixed up, but there’s a simple way to tell them apart.
While both have the genes for black and orange colors, calicos also have significant areas of white fur, thanks to another gene that causes expression of white color in addition to the orange and black.
Tortoiseshell cats (and their dilute tortoiseshell counterparts) feature a mix of black and orange colors without the prominent white markings.
Almost all calico cats are female due to their particular genetic code reliant on XX chromosomes The gene for red and black coat color is located on the X chromosome, and since females have two X chromosomes, they can display both red and black at the same time (with one X carrying the black gene and the other X carrying the orange gene).
Other genes can modify the orange and black color, such as genes that add white to the mix or dilute the red and black colors, as already discussed.
Since it takes two X chromosomes to be able to display both black and orange at the same time, this means that only female cats can be calico or tortoiseshell.
There is one exception, however. This is the situation where a male cat is born with an extra X chromosome. This means instead of being XY like normal males, they are XXY. With two X chromosomes they too can display red and black at the same time.
This phenomenon is called  Klinefelter Syndrome, and it is quite rare. While the exact odds of a cat being XXY is unknown for certain, the odds have been estimated to be somewhere between one in 1000 to one in 3000.
Calico cats are often thought to be rare, but this is a misconception that circulates among many unofficial sources. Since black and orange cats are common, the occurrence of calico and tortoiseshell patterns— which result from the combination of these colors — is not unusual at all.
However, when it comes to dilute calico cats, the frequency of occurrence is indeed lower. This is because, for a cat to display the dilute calico pattern, it must inherit two specific genetic traits: the calico pattern and the dilution gene.
In general, the price of a dilute calico is not influenced by its coat color. Instead, prices are influenced by the standard factors, such as the breed of the cat, whether it is a purebred or mixed breed, and reputation of the breeder.
For example, a dilute calico Persian or Scottish Fold will cost quite a bit more than a domestic shorthair dilute calico simply because purebred cats cost more than mixed breed cats or cats of unknown parentage.
The cat’s lineage, including its parents’ pedigree and any show-quality attributes, can also increase the price. Cats from a lineage of award-winning show cats are often more expensive due to their perceived superior genetic qualities and the potential for them to succeed in cat shows as well.
Dilute calico cats are not just beautiful; they’re an emblem of good luck and a testament to nature’s diversity.
If you’re thinking of adding one of these cats to your family, remember, the main thing they’ll require is plenty of love and the occasional admiring gaze at their gorgeous coat.  Whether you choose a purebred, domestic shorthair or longhair, dilute calico cats are sure to bring joy and warmth into your home.
Just be prepared for their independent nature and occasional stubbornness — after all, that’s just part of being a cat!

The Calico isn’t a breed of cat but is describing a color and pattern of the cat. Many breeds of cats can be calico, and ‘Dilute Calico’ simply means that the color of the cat is less intense.
An example of this would be cream being the dilute shade of red, almost like strawberry blonde. People interested in the origins of the cat trace its history back to the trade routes in Northern Africa and Europe, and more specifically to the port cities along the Mediterranean Sea.
A Calico cat is described as having 3 colors -  white, black, and red and Dilute Calico cats have ‘toned down’ shades of these 3 colors.
These are beautiful cats that can essentially have any size and shape and can weigh between 3 and 6kg. Their coat too can be in different colors and patterns and these don’t have any effect on the cat’s persoality.
Your Dilute Calico can have a short- or long-haired coat. Also, because the dilute calico coloring isn’t linked to any particular cat breed, these cats can be any size or shape really.
They are also nearly always female. Remember that while genes do have an effect on how your Dilute Calico looks and behaves, socialization plays a big part, and where possible, to get your cat from a reputable breeder.
Because calico cats are a coat-color and not a breed, you can find long hair dilute calico cats. The personality of the Dilute Calico is described as colorful as well as they’re fun-loving, independent, spunky cats that are sweet and loving too.
Because Dilute Calico cats can be found in many cat breeds, you can’t be certain how your feline friend will turn out.
Bring your pet up well though and treat him with love and care and you’ll have a devoted friend for between 13 and 20 years.
As already mentioned, the Dilute Calico isn't a specific breed but rather a color. The calico can be any breed. The average lifespan of any cat is 12-16 years. The males are far rarer than the females and they live shorter lives.
Cancer is a terrible disease in cats and dogs and it is where cells grow uncontrollably, spreading to all areas of the body. For any sign of illness in your Dilute Calico, get him to the vet.
Make sure your cat is vaccinated against the deadly cat diseases there are such as Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).
Both males and females can develop lower urinary inflammation, which is also called Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD). You’ll notice your pet straining to urinate. It’s time to get your pets to the vet with this terrible illness.
Prepare for your cat – have food dish, water bowl, litter box, cat food, brush, climbing tree, scratching post, cat toys,  and cat bed to welcome your pet.
When it comes to commercially manufactured cat food, there are many excellent ones on the market and you can choose from dry and wet cat food. If in any doubt about what is best for your cat, speak to your vet. Your cat is a carnivore and will need food that pays special attention to meat. A kitten will require 4 small bowls of food a day and by one year of age your cat can be receiving 2 smaller meals a day. Provide cool, fresh water around the clock..
Brush your Dilute Calico gently once a week. Some of the longer-haired Dilute Calicos will require brushing twice a week. At this grooming time, check that the eyes are nice and clear, free of discharge, check that the inside of the ears are free of wax and dirt build-up and check inside the mouth that there aren’t any troublesome teeth.
Whether your cat is an indoor cat or he goes outside occasionally, check for ticks and fleas and get him to the vet to check for internal parasites. Your cat will need to be dewormed and to receive all his cat vaccines to avoid some of the deadly cat diseases there are.
If your cat does go outside, make sure he has a cat collar and an ID tag.
Keep the litter box hygienically clean as cats won’t use a messy litter box. You can buy small scoops and rakes from the pet shop and rake up his droppings throughout the day.
Always have your cat neutered or spayed as there are way too many unwanted kittens in the world. Having them ‘fixed’ reduces lots of illnesses such as urinary inflammation.

Both Dilute Calico and Calico are originated from Egypt. Both Dilute Calico and Calico are having almost same weight. Dilute Calico may live 4 years more than Calico. Both Dilute Calico and Calico has same litter size. Dilute Calico requires Moderate maintenance. But Calico requires Low maintenance
The Calico isn’t a breed of cat but is describing a color and pattern of the cat. Many breeds of cats can be calico, and ‘Dilute Calico’ simply means that the color of the cat is less intense.
An example of this would be cream being the dilute shade of red, almost like strawberry blonde. People interested in the origins of the cat trace its history back to the trade routes in Northern Africa and Europe, and more specifically to the port cities along the Mediterranean Sea.
A Calico cat is described as having 3 colors -  white, black, and red and Dilute Calico cats have ‘toned down’ shades of these 3 colors.
Nobody can say with certainty where Calico cats originate from, but it is thought they they hail from Egypt, and that they later came to port cities in Spain, Italy and France.
Today these cats are found all over the world. Wherever these cats come from, they are 99.9% female and this is because of the cat’s unique chromosomal makeup. Most of the calico or tortoiseshell male cats are because of the chromosome abnormality.
The weird aspect with these amazing cats is because of their unique genetic makeup, and also because of the fact that the males are born sterile, these cats can’t be bred and they can emerge in different litters.
Since 2001 this cat has been Maryland's state cat. An interesting fact is that the Calico became the official cat of the state of Maryland because of its amazing colors of its fur which happen to be fairly similar to that of the Baltimore Oriole, the state bird.
These are beautiful cats that can essentially have any size and shape and can weigh between 3 and 6kg. Their coat too can be in different colors and patterns and these don’t have any effect on the cat’s persoality.
Your Dilute Calico can have a short- or long-haired coat. Also, because the dilute calico coloring isn’t linked to any particular cat breed, these cats can be any size or shape really.
They are also nearly always female. Remember that while genes do have an effect on how your Dilute Calico looks and behaves, socialization plays a big part, and where possible, to get your cat from a reputable breeder.
Because calico cats are a coat-color and not a breed, you can find long hair dilute calico cats. The personality of the Dilute Calico is described as colorful as well as they’re fun-loving, independent, spunky cats that are sweet and loving too.
Calico cats are known for their jaunty tri-colored coats with color such as white, black and orange. In fact, to be known as a Calico cat, these 3 colors need to be present, Calico isn’t a breed of cat as such, but is actually referring to the cat’s color variations.
Some of the most distinctive breeds of cars such a the Cornish Rex and Persians have these calico coats. One odd spec with these cats is that nearly all calico cats are female and this is because of the chromosomal makeup.
Size, coat texture, shade of coat, coat length and ear shapes can all vary with the type of calico cats you get so their weight can be anything from 3 to 7kg.
As mentioned, Calico cats aren’t a specific breed, and that is why it is actually difficult to describe the personality of a calico cat.
You’ll find certain calico cat owners describing their cat’s behavior but you won’t find any particular scientific studies of the cat’s personality. You could have a calm cat, one that is laid-back, a very vocal cat or a very active cat. In other words, these cats can be quiet, calm, excitable, friendly, shy, or mellow – their personality is formed from the way they are brought up and socialized.
Because Dilute Calico cats can be found in many cat breeds, you can’t be certain how your feline friend will turn out.
Bring your pet up well though and treat him with love and care and you’ll have a devoted friend for between 13 and 20 years.
The Calico is such an amazing type of cat and because it comes from so many cat breeds, the personality will vary, although having said that, there are a few characteristics that seem to be specifically attributed to the Calico cat.
One thing is for sure, these are intelligent, sweet, appealing, warm-hearted, loving cats that are good with children too. Perhaps in keeping with the quirky, jaunty coat, there is some quirkiness in the personality too, but that is precisely what makes these amazing cats the interesting characters they are.
To add to that, when you do research, you find that some have acted in bravey and saved their humans from harm in one way or the other.
As already mentioned, the Dilute Calico isn't a specific breed but rather a color. The calico can be any breed. The average lifespan of any cat is 12-16 years. The males are far rarer than the females and they live shorter lives.

The lifespan of the Calico cat be anything really and if you provide your calico with a wonderful home it will be able to reach 15 years of age.
Sometimes Klinefelteris Syndrome is a threat with this cat as a result of the XXY chromosomes. Their health is impacted because the disease can cause problems such as increased body fat and reduced bone mineral content.

Always have your cat neutered or spayed as there are way too many unwanted kittens in the world. Having them ‘fixed’ reduces lots of illnesses such as urinary inflammation.
Gently brush the Calico’s fur from time to time to ensure the jaunty colored coat is always shiny and healthy. It helps with the removal of dead hair as well and the cat enjoys the attention.
Every cat requires vaccines to prevent him from getting the deadly cat viruses there are, and to keep the cat free from parasites.
If there are any warning signs that there’s something wrong with your Calico, get him to the vet immediately.
Your Calico kitten will need to receive 3 meals a day. As your cat matures, two smaller meals a day will be good for your cat. You’ll find both canned- and dry packaged foods and your cat will let you know which one he prefers.
Your adorable Calico may beg for treats in between but as a responsible pet owner, make sure you don’t allow your Calico to overeat as obesity brings its own set of health issues.
