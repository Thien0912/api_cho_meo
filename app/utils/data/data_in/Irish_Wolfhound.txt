Although originally the breed was smooth coated or rough coated, only the rough coated variety exists today. It is thought that Phoenician sailors brought dogs of greyhound type from the Middles East to Ireland and these dogs were crossed with Mastiffs to produce a dog of gigantic size with the speed and strength to see off wolves which were a great threat to livestock in Ireland. By the end of the 18th century the wolf was extinct in Ireland and breed numbers dwindled. With the Great Famine in Ireland 1840s the breed became very rare.
However, a group of devotees lead by the Scotsman Captain George Augustus Graham developed a breeding programme to revive the breed, with the few Irish Wolfhounds which had survived using outcrosses with the heavier type of Deerhound, the Great Dane and the Tibetan Mastiff. The Irish Wolfhound is reputed to be the tallest of the hound breeds and the biggest of all breeds. Despite his size he is gentle and calm: truly a gentle giant.
Breeds originally used for hunting either by scent or by sight. The scent hounds include the Beagle and Bloodhound and the sight hounds such breeds as the Whippet and Greyhound. Many of them enjoy a significant amount of exercise and can be described as dignified, aloof but trustworthy companions.

The Irish Wolfhound is an exceptionally old breed. These dogs were around in the days of ancient Rome, with the first written record being from 391 C.E. when seven puppies were gifted to Quintus Aurelius Symmachus. They were used for hunting big game such as wolves, deer and boar, along with the long extinct and enormous Irish elk. Despite their rather ferocious beginnings, though, these canines are known for their patience and gentleness these days.
Irish Wolfhound CharacteristicsEnergy+ High-energy dogs will need a lot of mental and physical stimulation to stay happy and healthy, while low-energy dogs require minimal physical activity. It’s important when choosing a dog to make sure their energy levels match your lifestyle or vice versa. Trainability+ Easy-to-train dogs are more skilled at learning prompts and actions quickly with minimal training. Dogs that are harder to train will require a bit more patience and practice. Health+ Some breeds, due to their size or their breeds potential genetic health issues, have shorter lifespans than others. Proper exercise, nutrition, and hygiene also play an important role in the lifespan of your pet. Lifespan+ Some dog breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, and some more than others. This doesn’t mean that every dog will have these issues, but they have an increased risk, so it’s important to understand and prepare for any additional needs they may require. Sociability+ Some dog breeds are more social than others, both towards humans and other dogs. More social dogs have a tendency to run up to strangers for pets and scratches, while less social dogs shy away and are more cautious, even potentially aggressive. No matter the breed, it’s important to socialize your dog and expose them to lots of different situations. 

Irish Wolfhound Puppies

We suggest looking at rescue organizations for an Irish Wolfhound puppy. There are several rescue organizations for Irish Wolfhounds in the United States, and they sometimes have puppies (though they may be older puppies). Many of the dogs at rescues had owners who loved them but found that they couldn’t care for such a large dog, so make sure you have the space for an Irish Wolfhound before adopting one. Even though they start out small, they grow quickly into giants!
However, if you don’t find what you’re looking for from the rescue organizations, you’ll likely need to try a breeder. Ensure you’re going through a reputable breeder for one of these pups, though. Reputable breeders will prioritize the health of their Irish Wolfhounds and do all the required health screenings. For more information, breed clubs and the American Kennel Club (AKC) may be able to point you in the right direction.
Temperament & Intelligence of the Irish Wolfhound
The Irish Wolfhound is considered by most as the tallest canine breed, so they can seem imposing at first glance. Add in the breed’s past as war dogs, and you might expect a rather ferocious dog. However, you’d be wrong!
These pups may be large, but they are some of the gentlest dogs around. They get along with pretty much anyone—people, dogs, and even cats—and have seemingly limitless patience when it comes to children. The breed is also on the quiet side and tends to be relatively calm, so you don’t need to worry much about them running around the house and knocking things over. That said, they are also fairly clumsy the first couple of years of their lives, so watch out for that!
These dogs are fiercely loyal to their humans. Because they tend to make friends with almost everyone they meet, they aren’t the best watchdogs (but their vast size can be an automatic deterrent to others). Though the breed isn’t thought of as aggressive, they are brave. They’re also quite intelligent and eager to please their people.

Are These Dogs Good for Families? 👪
Provided you have enough room for the Irish Wolfhound (inside and outside your home), these dogs make fantastic family pets. They get along well with children and are full of patience for little ones. You should always keep an eye on children around this dog, though. Due to the breed’s size, they could accidentally knock over a child during play, and any bite, accidental or not, could be serious.
Also, consider the breed’s lifespan before adopting one. Due to their large size, these canines only live a short time (6 to 8 years). If you have children, you may want to think about how well they would handle that; you might feel that a breed with a longer lifespan is a better option.
Does This Breed Get Along With Other Pets? 🐶 😽 
Due to their friendly nature, this breed can absolutely get along with other pets. They’ll get along with other canines best, whether they’ve grown up with the other dogs in the home or you’re bringing the Irish Wolfhound in later.
These dogs can get along with cats, but you’ll need to extensively socialize them early on. Because Irish Wolfhounds are sighthounds, they have a rather significant prey drive, so they can be prone to chasing smaller animals. Introducing an Irish Wolfhound to your cat when they are a puppy can go a long way in helping the two get along. Also, due to this breed’s prey drive, you don’t want to leave these dogs alone with smaller animals like guinea pigs or rabbits at all, as the Irish Wolfhound could give chase.





Things to Know When Owning an Irish Wolfhound:
What else should you know about these giant canines? Everything from what to feed them to the sorts of health conditions they can be prone to developing! All the information you need to care for the Irish Wolfhound is below.
Food & Diet Requirements 🦴
Your Irish Wolfhound should be fed high-quality dog food that corresponds to their life stage and is designed for large or giant dog breeds. This way, you can make sure your pup gets all the nutrients they need to grow as they should and replenish the energy they burn. If you’re unsure whether the suggested amount of food on the bag is correct for your pup, speak to your dog’s vet about how much you should feed them. The packaging instructions are a guideline and may need altering for your individual dog.
As a large breed, the Irish Wolfhound has a deep chest cavity, making them more likely to get gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV)1 than other breeds. Bloat can be deadly and can be associated with eating too fast or one large meal of dry kibble per day. Although research is not clear on the subject, it is considered wise to avoid strenuous activity right before or after feeding time. Keep individual meals well-portioned to avoid overeating, and if your dog eats quickly, try out a puzzle feeder to slow them down.

Exercise 🐕
You might think a larger dog would need more exercise than a smaller one, but that isn’t the case for the Irish Wolfhound. These canines need daily exercise, but they’re only moderately active, so you don’t need to exercise them more than 30 to 45 minutes a day. They’ll enjoy long walks and good romps in the backyard, but because of their prey drive, only take their leash off in an area you know they can’t escape (such as your backyard or dog park). Otherwise, these dogs could see a squirrel, chase after it, and be gone in a blink!
While walks and playtime are great ways to meet your Irish Wolfhound’s exercise needs, these dogs also do well in canine sports like agility and lure coursing. Setting up an agility course in the backyard for your dog could be another excellent way to meet their daily exercise requirements.
Training 🎾
Irish Wolfhounds are highly intelligent and eager to please, so they tend to pick up on things quickly. Use positive reinforcement with them during training and begin training and socialization early on. While you can train this breed on your own if you have the know-how, puppy training classes are also recommended for these dogs. The Irish Wolfhound matures more slowly than some other breeds, so while they’re quick to learn, they might take a bit longer to train than a breed that matures more quickly.
Grooming ✂️
This breed is known as double coated and has a rough, wiry outer coat and a softer undercoat. While Irish Wolfhounds do shed year-round, they don’t shed a ton. Thoroughly brushing them once a week will help immensely in keeping their coats free of dirt and any loose hair. Commonly used brushes for these coarse coated dogs are an undercoat rake followed by a pin brush.
Irish Wolfhounds are a breed that also occasionally have their hair “stripped”, this is the process of removing dead hairs with a stripping knife or by hand. Although uncommon “post-grooming furunculosis”2 can be seen when dogs are stripped and bathed on the same day, as such some experts recommend having a gap of 2 weeks between the procedures.
Besides brushing them weekly, you’ll want to keep your Irish Wolfhound’s nails neat and trim to avoid problems. If you feel up to the task, you can cut these yourself or get your vet or a groomer to do it. These pups should also have their teeth brushed daily to help prevent dental problems.
You can also use grooming scissors to carefully trim around the face and paws if you are confident, but accidents happen easily, and this may be better left to the professionals.
You’ll also want to bathe your Irish Wolfhound occasionally. They won’t require many baths, though, as overbathing could lead to duller coats and irritated skin. Due to their size, you may want to take them to your vet or a groomer for this. Otherwise, you might end up bathing them in the backyard!

Health and Conditions 🏥
Unfortunately, the Irish Wolfhound is prone to developing quite a few health conditions. It doesn’t mean that yours will develop any of these; it’s just that the potential is there. Ensuring your pup comes from a reputable breeder (if you go that route) means that a dog or their parents should have been pre-screened or tested for many of these.
Minor Conditions

 Elbow dysplasia
 Hip dysplasia
 Osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD)

Serious Conditions

 Anesthesia sensitivity
 Bloat
 Dilated cardiomyopathy
 Fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy

Male vs Female
The only real differences between male and female Irish Wolfhounds will be their size and how much it costs to have them fixed/sterilized. Males of this breed will be roughly 2 inches taller and roughly 15 pounds heavier than females. It will cost less to have males neutered than females spayed.  Whether a male or female Irish Wolfhound is right for your family will mostly depend on your personal preference.

3 Little-Known Facts About the Irish Wolfhound
Want to learn even more about these gorgeous dogs? Here are a few more facts about the Irish Wolfhound that you might not have known!
1. Irish Wolfhounds are the tallest dogs.
We mentioned it before, but these dogs are considered the tallest dog breed around. Although some individual Great Danes have been taller, the Irish Wolfhound comes in taller overall. Some of these gentle giants are almost 7 feet tall when standing on their hind legs! Standing on all four legs, the males reach 32 inches at the withers.

2. The Welsh legend, “Gelert, the Faithful Hound”, is said to have been inspired by this breed.
The tale is one of extreme loyalty and immense regret and remorse. Whether or not it was actually inspired by the Irish Wolfhound isn’t known for sure, but it is believed this is just one of many legends inspired by these dogs.

3. This breed almost went extinct because they were too good at their job.
Although not all the reasons for extinction of the Irish Elk are known, extinction of the wolves was largely down to persecution from humans and habitat loss. The Irish Wolfhound was initially used to hunt wolves, deer, and more. However, by the end of the 1700s, the last wolves had disappeared in Ireland, which meant there really wasn’t a need for them any longer. As a result, the breed almost went extinct themselves.





Final Thoughts
The Irish Wolfhound may be the largest dog around, but these canines are incredibly gentle. Loving, loyal, intelligent, and friendly, these dogs make wonderful family pets. They have great patience when it comes to children and can get along with almost everyone they meet, including other animals. Because of their massive size, though, they do require a lot of room, both inside the home and out; these definitely aren’t apartment dogs! Provided you have enough room for one and you’re not put off by the cost to feed and provide veterinary care, the Irish Wolfhound could be the perfect pet for you.

3 Little-Known Facts About the Irish Wolfhound
Want to learn even more about these gorgeous dogs? Here are a few more facts about the Irish Wolfhound that you might not have known!
1. Irish Wolfhounds are the tallest dogs.
We mentioned it before, but these dogs are considered the tallest dog breed around. Although some individual Great Danes have been taller, the Irish Wolfhound comes in taller overall. Some of these gentle giants are almost 7 feet tall when standing on their hind legs! Standing on all four legs, the males reach 32 inches at the withers.

2. The Welsh legend, “Gelert, the Faithful Hound”, is said to have been inspired by this breed.
The tale is one of extreme loyalty and immense regret and remorse. Whether or not it was actually inspired by the Irish Wolfhound isn’t known for sure, but it is believed this is just one of many legends inspired by these dogs.

3. This breed almost went extinct because they were too good at their job.
Although not all the reasons for extinction of the Irish Elk are known, extinction of the wolves was largely down to persecution from humans and habitat loss. The Irish Wolfhound was initially used to hunt wolves, deer, and more. However, by the end of the 1700s, the last wolves had disappeared in Ireland, which meant there really wasn’t a need for them any longer. As a result, the breed almost went extinct themselves.





Final Thoughts
The Irish Wolfhound may be the largest dog around, but these canines are incredibly gentle. Loving, loyal, intelligent, and friendly, these dogs make wonderful family pets. They have great patience when it comes to children and can get along with almost everyone they meet, including other animals. Because of their massive size, though, they do require a lot of room, both inside the home and out; these definitely aren’t apartment dogs! Provided you have enough room for one and you’re not put off by the cost to feed and provide veterinary care, the Irish Wolfhound could be the perfect pet for you.

The Irish Wolfhound is one of the oldest dog breeds, with a history dating back to ancient times. Bred in Ireland, their ancestors were likely brought to the island by the Celts around 300 BC. They were originally used for hunting large game, including wolves and Irish elk. The breed's numbers declined over the centuries due to factors like warfare and changes in hunting practices. In the 19th century, efforts were made to revive the breed, leading to its preservation and popularity worldwide.
The Irish Wolfhound is a large and deep chested breed that can suffer from bloat, also known as gastric dilation volvulus (GDV). This is a life-threatening condition that can come on suddenly, so it’s important to know the warning signs and get an affected dog immediate veterinary care. They may be affected by pneumonia, heart conditions such as cardiomyopathy, liver shunt, and certain cancers such as osteosarcoma. An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is recommended as part of their regular annual exams. Other conditions from which they may suffer include von Willebrand Disease, startle disease, degenerative myelopathy, progressive retinal atrophy, megaesophagus, canine hip dysplasia, and osteochondritis dissecans.
Irish Wolfhounds are gentle giants and are known for their kind and friendly demeanor. Despite their imposing size, they are typically good-natured, patient, and affectionate with their families. They are not aggressive by nature and can be quite sociable with other dogs and pets. Due to their history as hunters, some Wolfhounds may still retain a strong prey drive, so early socialization is crucial.

Looking for a gentle giant whose heart is as big as their body? You’ve found them in the Irish Wolfhound. Their friendly, graceful disposition allows them to get along with just about anyone. They love to be around their humans and will crave quality time with their loved ones. They enjoy being around other dogs (though, it should be known that some other breeds may be intimidated by their size).

As puppies, Wolfhounds can be overly energetic, and boisterous, and require a lot of metaphorical hand-holding. However, it’s absolutely worth it when they reward you with their devoted love and companionship in return.
Irish Wolfhounds are an ancient breed that dates back long before the Roman Empire. In the year 391, the Romans received seven of these hounds who quickly proved to be majestic hunters. In Ireland around the 15th century, wolves were overrunning the countryside—that is until Wolfhounds were introduced, eventually causing them and most of the other native big game to go extinct in the 1700s.

In 1862, Geroge Augustus Graham began scouring the country for Irish Wolfhounds and made it his life’s work to protect and promote the breed. Today his name is still spoken with admiration among Wolfhound fanciers and is greatly credited with their domestic success.
Wolfhounds take a while to mature, up to four years on average. Owners who get younger dogs should be prepared and have realistic expectations that they will be living with a massive dog who won’t exhibit sensible adult behavior for roughly the first three years. There should be ample indoor, outdoor, and vehicle space for Wolfhounds to thrive.
Irish Wolfhounds are surprisingly active and fast given their size and they enjoy exercise, long walks, and regular daily play sessions in order to stay mentally and physically sharp.
Due to their large size, Irish Wolfhounds need a significant amount of indoor and outdoor space. A home with a securely fenced area is crucial. They should only be allowed to roam freely in areas where they can’t escape.
These hairy dogs possess a double coat consisting of a wiry outer covering and a soft undercoat. Irish Wolfhounds dogs don’t shed heavily in one season and instead, shed a moderate amount consistently throughout the year. A thorough brushing once or twice a week should do the trick to help keep them looking their best.
Wolfhounds are smart dogs and fast learners. Their desire to be around people and their sensitivity to humans make them excellent dogs for therapy work.
Wolfhound puppies are known to be a little destructive and can easily get up to no good when left home alone for long periods. They do best when they can play with other dogs who are around their own age. Early socialization and puppy training classes with positive reinforcement methods are strongly suggested. Leash training is also key to mastering as a puppy if you have any hopes of being able to take them on walks as an adult.
Irish Wolfhounds can make excellent family pets. They are quiet, friendly, and entirely devoted to their family. However, they may be too large of a dog to live with small children. Older children who can better comprehend that nothing is out of reach for an Irish Wolfhound are a much more safe and sensible option.
The cost of an Irish Wolfhound from a breeder is significantly more than the cost of adopting one from a local shelter or rescue. The adoption fee usually covers additional items such as spaying or neutering, vaccines, and microchipping.
