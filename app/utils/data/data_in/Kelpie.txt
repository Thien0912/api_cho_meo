The Australian Kelpie is a medium-sized herding dog bred for working livestock, particularly sheep and cattle, in Australia’s rugged and expansive terrains. Originating in the 19th century, the breed traces its roots to British collies imported to Australia, which were crossed with local dogs to adapt to the harsher climate and demanding workload. These dogs were prized for their independence, intelligence, and ability to work tirelessly over large distances.
Kelpies have a short double coat that comes in a variety of colors, including black, red, chocolate, fawn, and black-and-tan. According to breed standards, their coat is smooth, dense, and weather-resistant, providing protection during outdoor activities. They typically stand between 17-20 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh around 25-45 pounds. With a lifespan of 12-15 years, they are hardy and resilient.
Renowned for their working capabilities, Australian Kelpies excel at herding, agility sports, and other high-energy tasks. They are commonly used on farms, in search-and-rescue missions, and as service dogs in some cases.
Kelpies are known for their energetic, intelligent, and loyal temperament. They are eager to please and thrive on having tasks to complete, whether it’s herding livestock or participating in agility training. While they are generally even-tempered, their independence can sometimes be mistaken for stubbornness. However, with consistent training and firm handling, they respond well and exhibit great obedience.
Australian Kelpies are good with children but require supervision due to their herding instincts, which may cause them to nip at heels. They tend to get along well with cats if introduced early and socialized properly. Their barking level is moderate, and they usually bark only when necessary, such as to alert their owners of potential threats.
They are cautious but not aggressive toward strangers and exhibit a natural watchdog instinct. While they are not typically aggressive enough to serve as guard dogs, their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. Kelpies can be left alone for 4-6 hours but may develop destructive behaviors if left unattended for too long. Though they are hardy, they prefer not to be left outside alone for extended periods as they thrive on interaction and activity.

Training an Australian Kelpie is relatively straightforward due to their intelligence and eagerness to learn. They excel at obedience and agility training, but early socialization and consistent routines are crucial. Despite their cooperative nature, they can be willful if not properly managed.
Their grooming needs are moderate. Their coat requires weekly brushing to remove loose hair and maintain its sleek appearance. Bathing should be occasional unless they get dirty. Regular nail trimming and ear cleaning are also essential to their overall health.
Australian Kelpies are best suited to homes with ample outdoor space, such as a large backyard. They can adapt to apartments if their exercise needs are met, but homes with secure fencing are ideal due to their high jumping ability. To prevent escapes, fences should be at least six feet tall.
Kelpies can live harmoniously with other dogs if socialized early. Breeding pairs can be housed together, but supervision is necessary during certain times, like during heat. They adapt well to various climates but perform best in moderate to cooler temperatures.

When purchasing an Australian Kelpie puppy, ensure the breeder is reputable and provides health clearances for the parents, including screenings for hip dysplasia and PRA. Look for a puppy with bright eyes, clean ears, and an energetic demeanor. Coat color in puppies may vary and may not reflect the final adult coat.
For adoption, consider adult Kelpies from rescue centers. Ensure they undergo a thorough veterinary check-up to identify any pre-existing conditions. If planning to breed Kelpies, provide a nutrient-rich diet for pregnant females and a warm, secure space for whelping. Puppies require diligent care, including vaccinations, deworming, and early socialization.
Australian Kelpies are most popular in Australia, the USA, and the UK, with increasing popularity in countries like India and Germany. Puppy prices vary, ranging from $800 to $1,500, depending on lineage and location.

The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheepdog capable of mustering and droving with little or no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats.
The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie.[1] The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for its working ability.
The ancestors of most Kelpies were British dogs known loosely as collies (sometimes spelled colleys). These were mostly black, or very dark brown, dogs – hence the name collie, which has the same root as coal.[2][3] (The official collie breeds were not formed until about 10 or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed,[4] and the first recognised Border Collie was not brought to Australia until after the Federation in 1901).[5] Some collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred with other types of dogs – usually with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision.
For much of the 20th century and early 21st century it was claimed that kelpies were partly descended from dingoes.[6] In 2019, it was widely reported[7][8][9] that a genomic study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney indicated that the kelpie had no dingo ancestry[10] although this is still uncertain. Claire Wade, co-author of the study's paper, said that she has never suggested there was "no dingo blood in the Kelpie breed" as the media reported.[11] Wade explained:
The genes studied in our analysis were specifically chosen because it is those aspects of Kelpies (the ears and the ginger/cream colours) that lead most everyday people to presume the relationship between Kelpie and dingo. The evidence of our study proves conclusively that, at least for those characteristics, there is no evidence for relationship to be found.[11]
The first dog known as a Kelpie was a black and tan female pup with floppy ears bought by Jack Gleeson about 1872[12] from a litter born on Warrock Station near Casterton, owned by George Robertson, a Scot.[13] This dog was named after the kelpie, a mythological shapeshifting water spirit of Celtic folklore.[14] In later years she was referred to as "(Gleeson's) Kelpie", to differentiate her from "(King's) Kelpie", her daughter.
The second "Kelpie" was "(King's) Kelpie", another black and tan bitch out of "Kelpie" by "Caesar", a pup from two sheepdogs imported from Scotland. "(King's) Kelpie" tied for the prestigious Forbes Trial in 1879,[15] and the strain was soon popularly referred to as "Kelpie's pups", or just Kelpies. The King brothers joined another breeder, McLeod, to form a dog breeding partnership whose dogs dominated trials during 1900 to 1920.[12]
An early Kelpie, Sally, was mated to Moss, a Smooth Collie, and she produced a black pup that was named Barb after The Barb, a black horse which had won the Melbourne Cup in 1866. Consequently, black Kelpies became known as Barb Kelpies or Barbs.[16]
There were a number of Kelpies named Red Cloud. The first and most famous was John Quinn's Red Cloud in the early 20th century. In the 1960s, another Red Cloud became well known in Western Australia. This started the tradition in Western Australia of calling all Red or Red and Tan Kelpies, especially those with white chests, Red Cloud Kelpies.[17] Other notable specimens include Gunner and Red Dog (c. 1971 – 21 November 1979), a Kelpie mix which was the subject of a movie, Red Dog, released in 2011.
Kelpies have been exported to many countries including Argentina, Canada, Italy, Korea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States for various pursuits.[16]
By 1990, Kelpies had been trained as scent dogs with good success rates. In Sweden they have been widely used for tracking and rescue work.[16]
The Kelpie is a soft-coated, medium-sized dog, usually with prick ears and an athletic appearance. Their coat colours include black, black and tan, red, red and tan, blue, blue and tan, fawn, fawn and tan, cream, black and blue, and white and gold. The Kelpie generally weighs 14–20 kg (31–44 lb) and measures 41–51 cm (16–20 in) at the withers. They can reach a maximum weight of 25–27 kg (55–60 lb).[18]
Robert Kaleski published the first standard for the Kelpie in 1904. The standard was accepted by leading breeders of the time and adopted by the Kennel Club of New South Wales.[19] Contemporary breed standards vary depending on whether the registry is for working or show Kelpies. It is possible for a dog to both work and show, but options for competition in conformation shows might be limited depending on ancestry and the opinions of the kennel clubs or breed clubs involved.
In Australia, there are two separate registries for Kelpies. Working Kelpies are registered with the Working Kelpie Council (WKC)[20] and/or the Australian Sheepdog Workers Association.[21] The WKC encourages breeding for working ability, and allows a wide variety of coat colours. Show Kelpies are registered with the Australian National Kennel Council, which encourages breeding for a certain appearance and limits acceptable colours. The wide standards allowed by the WKC mean that many Working Kelpies do not meet the standard for showing.
In the US, the Kelpie is not recognised as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC).[22] However, the United Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club recognise the Kelpie and allow them to compete in official events.[23][24] As of 2015, Australian Kelpies have been accepted by the AKC as Herding Dogs allowed to compete in AKC sanctioned Sheep Herding Trials.[25]
The Working Kelpie comes in three coat types: short, smooth and rough. The coat can be almost any colour from black to light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti[26] is not unusual, and can look like a double coat.
Working Kelpies vary in size, ranging from about 19–25 in (48–64 cm) and 28–60 lb (13–27 kg).
A Working Kelpie can be a cheap and efficient worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock.[27][a]  The good Working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from moving away from the stockman.[12] This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears.[29] Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.[16]
Kelpies that are bred under the ANKC registrations are registered for show (Main Register) only in the following colours: Black, Chocolate, Red, Smoky Blue, Fawn, Black and Tan, and Red and Tan. They have a double coat and pricked ears. The other colours can be registered as pets and sporting dogs (Limited Register): Blue and Tan, Fawn and Tan and Yellow/Cream. Kelpies were first exhibited in the early 20th century, at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.[16] ANKC "Show" Kelpies are now becoming very popular both nationally and internationally as family pets, companion dogs, running mates and sport dogs due to their trainability, good nature and low maintenance of care and can be found all over the world.[citation needed]
Show Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia.[citation needed]
Kelpies are intelligent and easy to train dogs making them good-tempered and good pets, especially with children. However they require a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation, otherwise they can become bored and hence be disruptive by constantly barking or digging, or by chewing on objects. Working Kelpies are often described as "workaholics", with a strong drive to herd.[30]
Kelpies are a hardy breed with few health problems, but they are susceptible to disorders common to all breeds, such as cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, cerebellar abiotrophy and luxating patella. Research is underway to find the genetic marker for cerebellar abiotrophy in the breed.
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12 years based on a sample of 49 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.[31]
A Kelpie owned by a Victorian dairy farmer, Maggie, was thought to be the world's oldest dog at her time of death.[32]
On the Ludo show "Bluey" one of Bluey's classmates is a red Kelpie named Rusty. Rusty is featured in the Season Three episode of Bluey called "Cricket".

The Australian Kelpie is a breed that originated in Australia and is happy to be herding livestock all day in the hot Australian sun. Notably, they can do this with little or no direction from their owners, and they have an independent instinct that is almost unmatched by other breeds. They are loyal and devoted dogs that have almost unlimited energy and stamina. Kelpies are medium-sized dogs that come in a wide variety of colors, with distinctive upright ears and short, smooth fur.
The Australian Kelpie was bred to withstand the hot and harsh conditions of the Australian outback while independently herding sheep, and they are still used today for herding livestock. While this trait is ideal for farmers and owners who require hard-working animals, this can be challenging in an urban environment. These high-energy dogs need not only a ton of daily exercise, but also need a specific job and purpose. Without that, they can become destructive animals and will resort to chewing, digging, and barking as an outlet for their unending energy and drive.
If you are an active lover of the outdoors and this sounds like the dog for you, read on for a deeper dive into this resilient breed.
Australian Kelpies are a big responsibility, as they require a great deal of exercise and mental stimulation daily. This makes them ideal for farms and homes with large backyards with active owners, but they are not suitable for urban environments. This is something you’ll need to deeply consider before purchasing one of these energetic dogs. They can be quite territorial and may nip at times due to their herding instincts. This can make them a problem around small children, as they could be inclined to attempt to herd them into line!
With the right amount of exercise and training, though, they are loyal and devoted dogs that will be sure to keep you on your feet!

Australian Kelpies are hard-working, resilient animals that can work in the hot sun and dust for many hours without slowing down. This inexhaustible energy makes them ideal working dogs but a real responsibility to look after, as they’ll need tons of exercise. They are highly intelligent dogs that are incredibly independent, making them somewhat difficult to train. If you are on the search for a working dog, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more loyal, dependable, and devoted animal.
Due to their herding and hard-working heritage, be prepared to invest a great deal of time and energy into this dog if you are not planning to put them to work. They like to have a specific job to do and then be left to do it without your interference. Your relationship with this dog must be symbiotic, as opposed to a leader-and-worker dynamic, as they do not enjoy being told what to do constantly. These dogs have a history of being left to perform tasks with little or no control or supervision, and they can be well-trusted to do so.
Kelpies are wary of strangers and highly territorial, making them good watchdogs, but this trait can make them fearful of new dogs or experiences, so early socialization is essential.
Australian Kelpies love to be around people and thus make great family dogs. They become highly attached to their owners, earning them the nickname, “Velcro dog,” and they are loyal dogs that will constantly be at your side. One caveat is the fact that these dogs require dedicated training and early socialization, or they can be possessive and territorial at times.
This can result in over-protection and mild aggression toward strangers. They may be a tad overbearing for smaller children, and you’ll need to keep a close eye to keep them from herding your kids!
Australian Kelpies usually get along well with other pets, but their herding history may cause them to go after small dogs and other pets. They are especially notorious for their somewhat tense relationship with cats. Unless they have grown up with the family feline, they will likely cause them untold grief.
Australian Kelpies are active dogs and will need a diet that matches their high energy. Dry kibble is adequate—they’ll need around 1–2 cups per day—but these dogs will thrive on a diet consisting of healthy lean meats. This could include beef and chicken lean meats or organ meats, canned food with high meat content, and homemade bone broths. That said, if they are primarily fed on this diet, you’ll need to keep a careful eye on their nutrient intake.
If you decide to give your Kelpie dry kibble or wet food, try and make sure that it is specially formulated for active dogs and free from filler ingredients like wheat and corn. They should ideally be fed twice daily, whether given kibble or a mixture of foods, as this will keep their fast metabolism energized.
Table scraps should be strictly avoided, as these dogs can easily get overweight, and this can cause untold health consequences. Human foods like wheat, corn, sugar, and dairy should also be strictly avoided for the same reasons.
These active dogs are high-energy animals that require a great deal of intensive exercise, and they are known for running up to 60km a day as working dogs! Not only will regular exercise keep them happy and healthy, but it will also keep their chasing and herding instincts in check. This physical activity should be supplemented with mental challenges to keep their minds active as well. These games, including fetch, frisbee, and hide and seek, will further stimulate their herding instinct and make for a far calmer dog that is even in temperament.
A casual 20-minute stroll just won’t cut it for these dogs, and we recommend at least two hours of daily exercise for Kelpies, split into two sessions. If time is an issue, try jogging or cycling with them, or consider using a weight vest to help expend some energy and build muscle.
Exercise doesn’t need to be confined to only walking or running, and there are other options to tire out your Kelpie. These dogs will thrive in agility classes and groups and will love the challenge of learning new skills. Other activities, like swimming, scenting, and tug of war, are sure to give this breed a good workout.
Australian Kelpies can be a challenge to train, as they have a fiercely independent nature. Whether your Kelpie is a family companion or a working dog, the same principles will apply when training.
Training should begin the moment you bring your Kelpie puppy home. Early socialization with other family pets and basic command training can begin immediately. The earlier you start, the better. Due to their rich heritage as loyal and independent herding dogs that were often left alone and trusted to do their job, these loyal dogs are trustworthy and will appreciate being treated as somewhat of an equal, as opposed to being told what to do. Reward-based training is an ideal method, as it builds trust between you and your dog and creates a strong bond of partnership.
With all this in mind, these dogs love having a job to do, and they will generally enjoy training. Basic command and obedience training is essential to get started early, and training in earnest can begin at the early age of 4–6 weeks.
These dogs are fairly low maintenance, and not much special attention is needed in the way of grooming. Brushing their coat lightly once or twice a week will remove any dead hair and help keep shedding to a minimum. These active dogs will usually wear their nails down all on their own, but you should still perform regular checks to make sure because long nails can cause them pain and discomfort.
They will need regular teeth brushing to avoid bad breath and dental issues and the occasional rinse with clean water if they get a bit muddy. Other than that, perform regular checks on their ears for infection or parasites, and make sure they are clean of any debris.
Australian Kelpies are generally a healthy breed and mostly free from breed-specific issues. However, there are potential health conditions to be aware of. These include:
Upbringing and environment are much more accurate predictors of personality than gender, and every dog is unique. However, male and female Australian Kelpies do have small differences.
Male Australian Kelpies are generally taller and heavier than females and are known to be more high-energy. Even when they are neutered, males have a tendency to wander. Females are more independent and stubborn at times but are easier to train than males because they mature faster.
Spaying females and neutering males will negate most of these differences and make for an all-round happier dog. The personality and temperament of the puppy when you meet them will give you a better indication of how the dog will be as they grow up, rather than their sex. Therefore, it really comes down to personal preference when deciding on a male or female, as one does not have any distinct advantage over the other.
Convicts were primarily used in Australia for herding sheep until the Kelpie came along. Eventually, the massive flocks of sheep became unmanageable for people, and dogs were required to do the work. They had to cover massive distances in the blazing sun and scouring temperatures and could easily do the work of several humans.
Nowadays, this skill is still widely utilized, and farmers need to employ far fewer staff to manage their flocks, thanks to the tireless Kelpie.
These dogs are highly prized in Australia and are one of the top 10 most popular breeds on the continent. The Kelpie was first registered in Australia in 1902 and is one of Australia’s earliest registered breeds. One of the main reasons for economic development in Australia was its vast flocks of sheep, some of the highest in the world at the time. This success could not have been possible without the indomitable Kelpie.
These dogs are an Australian icon—for good reason—although their heritage lies in Scotland, as they are descendants of Collie breeds. The clue lies in their name: the word “Kelpie” is a water spirit of Scottish folklore found in lochs and pools of Scotland. One of the earliest incarnations of the breed was named Kelpie, and the name stuck.
It’s thought that the Collie descendants bred with Australia’s native feral dog, the Dingo. While there is no genetic proof of this, a single look at the Kelpie is enough to convince one that there is a high probability.
Australian Kelpies are truly working dogs in every sense of the word. If you are looking for a companion to lounge with on the sofa and accompany you on the occasional walk, the Kelpie is not the dog for you. These active dogs require a ton of regular exercise and are difficult animals to tire out. This makes them an ideal choice for active owners or farmers who need working dogs, but not a great choice for urban environments. They are loyal, dependable, and devoted dogs that will become your shadow and make great family dogs too.
If you are up to the task of rigorous training and exercise, the loyal and energetic Australian Kelpie is a great choice of a canine companion.

The Australian Kelpie is a medium-sized dog that has become more popular in recent years due to their unconditional loyalty and high intelligence. If you have been thinking about getting this breed but are still on the fence about it, keep reading as we dig in and discuss their characteristics, appearance, grooming needs, and health conditions, so you can see if they are right for you.
Height:
17–20 inches
Weight:
35–50 pounds
Lifespan:
10–13 years
Colors:
Black, black and tan, red and tan, fawn, red, chocolate, blue
Suitable for:
Individuals and families, experienced dog owners, working environments
Temperament:
Intelligent, loyal, protective
The Australian Kelpie has exceptional herding skills and high intelligence, making them great working dogs. They have plenty of energy and a strong work ethic. They are also loyal to their owners, forming strong bonds with their family members. They also have a strong desire to please, which makes them great companions even if you don’t have a job for them to do.

Australian Kelpie puppies are extremely active and playful, like the adult dogs, but their curiosity can get them into trouble without plenty of supervision. It’s the perfect time to socialize them with as many people, places, and things as possible so they feel more comfortable around them as adults. Holding scheduled training sessions and spending plenty of time with them to help develop strong bonds is also crucial.
When looking for an Australian Kelpie puppy to purchase, there are plenty of online sources available. Just be sure to choose a reputable breeder who follows the breed standards and provides the proper paperwork and history for the dog that you are buying.

The Australian Kelpie is an alert and energetic dog that is protective of their owners, which can make them wary of strangers without plenty of socialization as puppies. However, they are not usually aggressive and are instead playful and affectionate. They follow orders well and can work long days without becoming tired.
The Australian Kelpie dog has exceptional intelligence, which might be due to their possible connection to the Border Collie, another highly intelligent dog breed. They can learn new tasks quickly and are great problem solvers and independent thinkers.
The Australian Kelpie can be a great choice for active families that enjoy spending time outdoors. They also need plenty of space to run and play, so they are not well-suited to small homes, and their strong herding instincts can make them unpopular with children. However, they are playful and friendly, which makes them fun companions, and their protective nature will help you keep your home safe.
The Australian Kelpie dog usually gets along with other family dogs quite well, especially if they receive plenty of socialization with them as a puppy. However, their strong herding instincts and prey drive might cause them to chase after smaller animals, like cats.

Due to their high energy levels, your Australian Kelpie will need a high-quality dog food that lists real meat like chicken, turkey, or beef as the first ingredient and doesn’t have any chemical preservatives or artificial colors. Talk over your pet’s diet with your vet, especially if they have a health problem, to ensure that you are providing the highest quality nutrition.
An Australian Kelpie is an active dog that will need at least 1–2 hours of exercise each day with a mix of activities that include running, playing fetch, and agility training. Short, frequent bouts of play are better than longer ones, especially for puppies, and remaining consistent is essential to help them get into a routine that they can look forward to.
The Australian Kelpie dog is an intelligent breed that is capable of learning many tricks. However, their high energy level can make it hard for them to stay focused during your sessions. Getting started while they are still a puppy can set them up for a schedule that lasts into adulthood. Use plenty of positive reinforcement like treats and praise to help keep them interested, and holding your sessions after playtime will allow your pet to burn off excess energy before you get started.
Your Australian Kelpie requires regular brushing to keep their fur looking great, especially during the spring and fall when they tend to shed more. You will also need to trim their nails if you hear them clicking on the floor and check their ears frequently for signs of buildup and infection.
Minor Conditions
Serious Conditions

The male Australian Kelpie is usually slightly taller and heavier than the female and is usually more outgoing, playful, and energetic. The female is usually more reserved and independent, often displaying a protective and nurturing nature. Both make great companions and working dogs.

While most experts believe that these dogs got their start in Australia, their exact lineage isn’t completely clear, with certain legends claiming that their amazing abilities come from a mythical creature called the “Kelpie,” which is a shape-shifting water spirit.
The strong herding instincts of these dogs often kick in while they are still puppies, and they will begin to herd people and other animals without any training.
Aside from their strong herding skills, the Australian Kelpie’s high intelligence enables them to learn and perform many other important tasks, including search and rescue. They also make great service and therapy dogs.

The Australian Kelpie dog is a wonderful breed with a high energy level well suited to families that like to spend a great deal of time outdoors. These dogs need plenty of room to run, so they are not well suited to smaller homes, but they are easy to train and form strong bonds with their owners. Their playful nature makes them fun to have around, and their endless energy means they are always ready to do whatever you want, whether it be a hard day’s work or a relaxing walk through the woods.
