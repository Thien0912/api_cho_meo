The UK's favourite breed has come a long way from its hard-working Canadian roots, but today's Labrador still makes a reliable working dog because the breed is active, eager and easy to train. We can see why this highly intelligent breed is so popular, and for a good-natured family pet, the Labrador is a sensible choice.
Labradors are playful and intelligent, with a warm, friendly temperament that makes them ideal for first-time owners.

Labradors have a short and smooth coat which can come in yellow, chocolate or black. Although their fur is sleek and easy to take care of, they can be prone to shedding.

Considering buying or rehoming a Labrador Retriever? Before you find a puppy or adopt a Labardor, here are a few important things to remember.
Considering buying or rehoming a Labrador Retriever? Before you find a puppy or adopt a Labrador, here are a few important things to remember.
Labradors are considered to be heavy shedders, and will shed throughout the year. Labradors also tend to have heavy seasonal sheds around spring and autumn – something known as “blowing coat”. There’s nothing you can do to stop your dog from shedding, but regular brushing will help to remove any loose fur and keep your Labrador’s coat in tip-top condition.
Active and intelligent, Labradors need at least 2 hours of exercise per day. Labradors’ Gundog heritage means that the breed is instinctively energetic and always ready to go. However, this active breed can overdo it if you’re not careful and they are prone to joint issues. Swimming can be a great low-impact form of exercise and is something that comes naturally to Labradors.
Gentle and affectionate, Labradors are one of the UK’s most popular family pets for good reason. Their even tempers and patient nature means that Labradors tend to be good with children. However, Labradors also have a tendency to forget their size and can be overly excitable when playing meaning they are often better suited to families with slightly older children. As with any breed, Labradors should always be supervised when around children to make sure everyone stays safe and happy.
As they are so sociable and friendly, Labradors thrive on attention and love to be in the heart of their family. This means they can be prone to separation anxiety and don’t tolerate being left alone for too long. If you do have to leave your Labrador alone for a few hours, make sure they have plenty of toys to keep them occupied and consider having someone come to check in on them.
Labradors are not generally considered to be aggressive and have famously gentle, affectionate natures. In fact, Labradors are a popular choice for a family pet, due to their kind and playful spirit. The breed tends to get on well with people and other animals alike and they’re always ready to make new friends.
Whilst Labradors are often considered to be slow or goofy, their Gundog history makes them quite the opposite. Labradors are intelligent, easy to please and quick learners meaning they are highly trainable. Once they’ve mastered the basics, Labradors will love to keep learning new tricks to keep their mind active and alert. Food is an excellent motivator for Labradors, but make sure you don’t overdo it on the treats to avoid any unhealthy weight gain.

The Labrador Retriever, often known simply as the Labrador or Lab, is a British breed of gundog and one of the most popular dog breeds worldwide. With their iconic floppy ears, expressive eyes, and wagging tails, Labs exude charm and warmth. Renowned for their athletic abilities and eagerness to please, Labs excel in various roles, from therapy work to search and rescue. The Labrador’s gentle and patient temperament also makes them exceptional companions for children, earning them the reputation of being one of the best family dogs.
In addition to their affable personality, Labrador Retrievers are highly versatile and athletic dogs. Originally bred as retrieving dogs for fishermen, they possess a strong instinct to fetch and carry objects, making them excellent partners for outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, and retrieving games. Labs thrive in various sports and competitions, including agility, obedience trials, and dock diving. With their winning combination of intelligence, sociability, and athleticism, Labrador Retrievers continue to capture the hearts of dog lovers around the world. After a 31-year run as America’s most popular dog breed, Labs lost the title to the French Bulldog in 2023.
Labrador Retrievers have a sleek, water-resistant double coat, which serves as both insulation and protection. This coat consists of a dense, soft undercoat and a short, straight, weather-resistant outer coat, ideal for working as waterfowl retrievers. Labrador Retrievers come in three recognized color variations: black, yellow, and chocolate. Black Labradors were historically the most common, prized for their working abilities, while yellow Labradors range from pale cream to rich fox red, and chocolate Labradors exhibit shades from light brown to deep, dark chocolate. These colors are determined by specific genetic combinations, and minor variations like a white chest spot or faint shading can occur without impacting the dog’s pedigree.
Labrador Retrievers have a balanced, athletic build that reflects their role as versatile working dogs. Their medium-sized, muscular frame is complemented by a broad skull, expressive eyes, and a well-defined muzzle. They are instantly recognizable by their “otter tail,” which is thick at the base and tapers to a point, covered in short, dense fur. Labradors have a friendly and intelligent expression, often enhanced by their medium-sized, pendant-shaped ears. Their webbed paws and strong legs make them exceptional swimmers, a trait further supported by their water-resistant coat.
Labrador Retrievers are medium to large-sized dogs with well-proportioned, athletic builds. Males typically stand 22.5 to 24.5 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 65 and 80 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, measuring 21.5 to 23.5 inches in height and weighing 55 to 70 pounds. Their size is influenced by genetics, with lineage playing a significant role, as well as factors like diet and exercise, which help maintain a healthy weight and build. Generally, males are larger and heavier than females. Despite their size, Labradors are known for their gentle, friendly nature and adaptability, making them suitable for various living environments as long as they receive adequate exercise and care.
Labrador Retrievers are renowned for their friendly, outgoing, and eager-to-please personality, making them one of the most popular dog breeds worldwide. They are highly social and thrive on human companionship, often forming strong bonds with their families. Labradors are intelligent and trainable, excelling in obedience and various roles, including service work, therapy, and hunting. Their playful and energetic nature makes them wonderful companions for active individuals and families, while their patience and gentle demeanor make them excellent with children and other pets. Labradors are also known for their strong retrieving instinct, love of water, and ability to adapt to different environments, showcasing a perfect blend of work ethic and affectionate companionship.
Labrador Retrievers are intelligent and eager-to-please dogs, making them highly trainable with the right approach. Early training and socialization are essential to help them grow into well-mannered, confident companions. Labradors respond best to positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats, praise, and play, as they are motivated by rewards and enjoy pleasing their owners. Socialization during puppyhood is crucial, exposing them to various people, animals, environments, and situations to reduce the likelihood of fear or behavioral issues later in life. Their playful and energetic nature requires consistent, engaging training sessions to keep their attention and channel their energy constructively. Proper training ensures they are obedient and adaptable, making them a joy to live with.
Labrador Retrievers hail from the island of Newfoundland, off the northeastern Atlantic coast of Canada. Originally called St. John’s dogs, after the capital city of Newfoundland, Labs served as companions and helpers to the local fishermen in the 1700s. The dogs spent their days working alongside their owners, retrieving fish who had escaped hooks and towing in lines, and then returned home to spend the evening with the fishermen’s family.
Although their heritage is unknown, many believe the St. John’s dog was interbred with the Newfoundland Dog and other small local water dogs. Outsiders noticed the dog’s usefulness and good disposition, and English sportsmen imported a few Labs to England to serve as retrievers for hunting. The second Earl of Malmesbury was one of the first and had St. John’s dogs shipped to England sometime around 1830.
The third Earl of Malmesbury was the first to refer to the dogs as Labradors. Amazingly, Labs–now America’s most popular dog–were almost extinct by the 1880s, and the Malmesbury family and other English fans are credited with saving the breed. In Newfoundland, the breed disappeared because of government restrictions and tax laws. Families were allowed to keep no more than one dog, and owning a female was highly taxed, so girl puppies were culled from litter.
In England, however, the breed survived, and the Kennel Club recognized the Labrador Retriever as a distinct breed in 1903. The American Kennel Club followed suit in 1917, and in the ’20s and ’30s, British Labs were imported to establish the breed in the U.S. The breed’s popularity began to take off after World War II, and in 1991, the Labrador Retriever became the most popular dog registered with the American Kennel Club–and they’ve held that distinction ever since. They also top the list in Canada and England. Today, Labs work in drug and explosive detection, search and rescue, therapy, assistance to those with disabilities, and as retrievers for hunters. They also excel in all forms of dog competitions: show, field, agility, and obedience.
Labrador Retrievers are active, friendly, and loyal dogs that require regular care to stay healthy and happy. They have a short, dense double coat that sheds year-round, so consistent grooming is important to manage shedding and keep their skin healthy. Labs need regular exercise, such as daily walks and playtime, to maintain their physical health. A balanced diet, proper dental care, and routine veterinary checkups are essential for their well-being. Labs also thrive on mental stimulation, so engaging activities and training sessions are important to keep them mentally sharp.
Preventative care and regular veterinary visits are essential for keeping your Labrador Retriever healthy throughout their life. Vaccinations are important to protect them from diseases such as rabies, parvovirus, and distemper, especially during their puppy years. Annual wellness exams help catch potential health issues early, allowing for prompt treatment.
Feeding and nutrition are essential for maintaining the health and well-being of a Labrador Retriever. Labs require a balanced diet rich in high-quality protein, such as chicken, beef, or fish, to support their muscle development and overall health. Healthy fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, are crucial for maintaining a shiny coat and healthy skin. Carbohydrates like sweet potatoes or rice provide energy and fiber for digestion. The amount of food should be tailored to the Lab’s age, weight, and activity level, with puppies needing more calories for growth and adults requiring balanced portions to prevent obesity. Regular meals, proper portion control, and a focus on fresh water intake help maintain optimal health, while treats should be given in moderation to avoid overfeeding. It’s important to consult a vet to ensure your Lab’s diet meets their specific nutritional needs.
If your Lab is overweight, portion control becomes even more important. You should consult your vet for a tailored plan, but in general:
Labrador Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labs will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.
Labs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Labs in need of adoption and or fostering in lab rescue groups. If you don’t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Lab rescue.
The cost of a Labrador Retriever puppy can vary significantly depending on factors such as the breeder’s location, the puppy’s lineage, and whether the dog has been trained or comes from a championship bloodline. On average, a Labrador Retriever puppy typically costs between $1000 and $4,000. Pet-quality Labs, which are bred for companionship rather than show potential, usually cost between $100 and $1,500, while show-quality Labs, which have a pedigree and potential for dog shows, can range from $1,500 to $4,000 or even higher. Adoption or rescue fees for a Labrador Retriever tend to be much lower, typically ranging from $100 to $300, depending on the organization. Additionally, costs can vary based on geographical location, demand, and the health screenings or vaccinations the breeder provides before sale.

The Labrador Retriever, also known as Labrador or simply Lab, is one of the most popular breeds in the world. Labrador Retrievers trace their origins back to the 19th century in Newfoundland, which is now part of Canada. They were originally referred to as St. John's dogs or Lesser Newfoundland dogs. They were used as working dogs by local fishermen to help retrieve fishing nets and escaped fish due to their excellent swimming capabilities and hardworking nature. In the early 19th century, English nobles visiting Canada noticed these dogs' abilities and brought some back to England, where they were further developed into the breed we know today.
Labrador Retrievers can suffer from hip, elbow, and shoulder dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy, patellar luxation, osteochondritis dissecans, exercise-induced collapse, distichiasis, tricuspid valve dysplasia, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hot spots. Labs may be affected by centronuclear myopathy, congenital myasthenic syndrome, hereditary nasal parakeratosis, oculoskeletal dysplasia 1, skeletal dysplasia 2, Stargardt Disease, cystinuria, elliptocytosis, hyperuricosuria, ichthyosis, myotubular myopathy 1, narcolepsy, pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, chondrodystrophy with or without chondrodysplasia, copper toxicosis, achromatopsia, and Alexander Disease. They can also be prone to eye disorders including macular corneal dystrophy, progressive rod-cone degeneration, retinal dysplasia, entropion, cataracts, and central progressive retinal atrophy. Genetic testing for hereditary conditions can assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Labradors are known for their kind nature, intelligence, and adaptability. They are very sociable dogs that get along well with people and other animals. They are excellent with children, making them a popular choice for family pets. Labs are also intelligent and eager to please, making them highly trainable for roles such as service dogs, search and rescue dogs, and other working tasks. They love swimming and water.
The Labrador's thick, tapering tail is called an "otter tail". When they're swimming in the water, their tail serves as a rudder to steer and turn.The name "Labrador" is a bit misleading since the breed did not originate from Labrador in Canada, but rather from Newfoundland.Labs have webbed feet which makes them excellent swimmers. This feature helped them in their original work of retrieving fishing nets.Labradors are often employed as guide dogs for the visually impaired due to their intelligence, trainability, and gentle nature. According to the Guide Dogs of America, about 70% of their guide dogs are Labs.The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular dog breed in the United States for over two decades, according to the AKC's annual rankings.

Bred to be a friendly companion and a working dog, the Labrador is an ideal pet for anyone looking for a loyal and intelligent four-legged friend. With time, the Labrador dog breed became one of the most popular across the world, winning the hearts of everyone, from families to royalty and celebrities.
¹L. Kearsley-Fleet et al, 'Prevalence and risk factors for canine epilepsy of unknown origin in the UK', Jan 2013, Veterinary Record
The Labrador colours vary from black and yellow, to chocolate, with some dogs sporting different shades and hues.
The Labrador Retriever is an active, friendly, loving dog who thrives on human companionship, wanting nothing more than to please their owners (except perhaps eat anything and everything, and jump in any water they can find!). They are ideal pets for households with children and they get on well with other household animals.
Labradors are a very happy breed, extremely affectionate, constantly wagging their tails and always on the go. They are easily trained, being eager to learn, and to please, and can turn their paw to just about anything. They are total foodies however, which helps with their training, but not their waistlines!
Meet Cooper
"He lives life at 100mph, does nothing in half measures and is just all in - all the time. Whether that's lying fully on you for the biggest cuddle, eating his dinner at record speed or running, playing and chasing."
Meet Ian
"There is definitely a difference between the working and show lines. Working lines definitely want to be kept busier."
Meet Merlin
"They will eat (and eat and eat). They don't get full and will find food even if not intended for them. Food is life!"
The Labrador Retriever breed originated not in Labrador, but on the coast of Newfoundland, in the 17th century. They were trained to bring in the fishing-nets through the icy waters for the fishermen and, in the early 19th century, were brought to Poole Harbour in Great Britain.
They were so attractive and with such appealing personalities that the fishermen had umpteen offers from Englishmen to buy them. The breed with their working abilities was instantly successful as a gundog. The Earl of Malmesbury became fascinated by these dogs, known at that time as Saint John's Dogs, and he started breeding them, calling them Labrador Dogs. Today, Labradors are still used as working gundogs as well as being beloved family pets.
Ideal Lab owners enjoy long walks, are mud-proof and water-proof, and have the time, patience and skill to teach this breed to be a polite member of society. Although universally thought of as the ultimate, easy-going family dog (and they do generally love everyone!), without training and plenty of exercise, young Labradors can be distinctly thuggish and rude in their over-enthusiasm, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking they’re born steady and reliable! Great for active families with children who can take part in training and exercise – and who can walk this active gundog a couple of hours every day in all weathers.
Labradors will adapt to the amount of time you can allocate for their exercise, as long as they are kept active. Ideally, a couple of hours a day being a good amount for a healthy adult. They love long walks with a chance to run and play off the lead. Many Labradors, unfortunately, become overweight because they are bought by families who want them for their reputation as the perfect dog with children, without realising that this is a working dog, who needs a lot of exercise and training to stay happy and healthy.
As well as walks, a Labrador will revel in games and play with their owner, as they are highly social, and need to be involved in all family activities.
The Labrador is a large, active breed who is at heart a country dog, and so needs a good-sized living space. As the Labrador size is large and their energy is high, they will appreciate a large garden and need access to the great outdoors for long walks.
Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. The Labrador is prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.
Your dog's diet needs to have the right balance of all the main nutrient groups including a constant supply of fresh water. It's important to conduct regular body condition scores to ensure you keep your dog in ideal shape and remember to feed them at least twice daily and in accordance with the feeding guidelines of their particular food. Proper nutrition along with care can contribute to a Labrador lifespan reaching 14 years.
The Labrador grooming process is fairly easy as their coats are simple to maintain. Even though the Labrador size is large, their coat is thick and dense with a weather-resistant undercoat that can easily be kept clean with a simple brush through once a week, and more regular attention when moulting. However, they do love water and mud, and so they may need more regular grooming to keep them clean. Watch out for grass seeds in the summer as they tend to charge around the countryside!
Labradors are generally a joy to train as they are both clever and biddable, and love working with their owner. Despite being generally unproblematic, they do still need training as they have a need to work and to keep their busy brains occupied. Plus, they can easily get overly-boisterous, and even destructive, if not given plenty of exercise, and an outlet for their hard-wired breed behaviours.
Being a retrieving breed, it’s especially important to train them using positive, reward-based methods to happily give up any ‘prizes’ they find that they might otherwise want to keep hold of!
There is a good reason why the Labrador has a reputation as being, almost, the perfect family dog. This is a breed who loves everyone and everything. Their only drawback is that they need a lot of exercise, and so they need an active family who enjoy walking and games.
All dogs and children need to be taught to get on with and respect each other, and be safe together. Even so, dogs and young children should never be left alone together and adults should supervise all interactions between them.
Are Labradors lazy?
Labradors are known to be highly active and outgoing, but as they get older, they might be prone to becoming lazier.
What should I know about a Labrador?
Labradors simply adore water, so you should be expecting lots of jumping in puddles and getting messy. Also, they are easily trained and are versatile workers so they can be taught to do almost anything.
Are Labradors smart?
In general, Labradors are considered very smart dogs. Given their breeding as hunters, they possess very heightened instincts and intelligence.
Do Labradors bark a lot?
The Labrador breed is not particularly chatty and they will usually keep quiet, unless they want to get someone’s attention or feel provoked.

In the 21st century, Labrador Retrievers play many important roles. They are guide dogs to the blind, rescue dogs for law enforcement, and loving companions to millions of families.
If you’re looking for a calm-natured and intelligent family dog to join your home, a Labrador is likely to tick all of your boxes.
It’s important to conduct thorough research before committing to buying or adopting a pup. To find out all there is to know about Labrador Retrievers, you’re in the right place.
We’ve compiled a complete breed guide, including feeding habits, grooming info and character traits. By the end of this article, we promise that you’ll be a Labrador expert!
Labrador Retrievers were originally bred in Newfoundland, Canada, in the 18th century. They worked as fisherman’s helpers, retrieving fish that had escaped the nets and keeping fisherman company.
Once news got out about these loyal companions, they were exported across the world- including to Britain and the USA- and gained massive popularity by the 1950s.
These purebred dogs were recognized by the American Kennel Club as a distinct breed in 1903. In 1991, they won the title of ‘America’s Most Popular Dog’- and they’ve held the title ever since!
Labradors today work in a range of fields- detecting explosives, participating in animal therapy, retrieving for hunters and assisting those with disabilities. While their intelligence makes them perfect for professional work, their gentle nature has secured them a reputation as one of the sweetest dog breeds around.
Labrador Retriever is a medium-to-large dog breed characterized by its short coat and athletic physique. As a member of the sporting group, Labradors love to exercise, from swimming to games of fetch.
There are three main colours of Labrador: black, yellow and chocolate. A Labrador Retriever’s coat is typically hard and dense.
Due to their intelligence and friendly nature, Labradors have been bred to create many different hybrid breeds. These include Labradoodles (Labrador/Poodle cross), Boston labs (Labrador/ Boston Terrier cross), Boxadors (Labrador/Boxer cross) and Golden Labradors (Labrador/Golden Retriever cross).
While the characteristics of these Lab crosses depends on the genetics of both parents, pure-breed Labradors are recognizable by their short hair, well-balanced physique and friendly facial features.
Because Labradors are independent and adaptable, they can fit nicely into many different types of households. Here are some of the best fits for this breed:
Due to its calm nature, a Labrador Retriever makes a fantastic family dog. Labs generally love children and babies.
Labradors are also known to get along well with other animals, so having other pets already shouldn’t pose an issue.
Unlike some other breeds, a Labrador will relish the chance to join you on a jog, hike or wild swim. Labrador Retrievers are the perfect companion for athletic and outdoorsy types.
Labs also have a curious nature, making them well suited to joining you on exciting adventures. From beaches to forests, your Lab will be happy to join you wherever your wanderlust takes you!
Labradors are good at almost every type of service work, from fetching items to leading the way while out and about. Their soft mouths allow them to pick things up gently, while their calm temperament means they aren’t easily distracted.
When it comes to grooming, it couldn’t be easier than with a Labrador. A Lab’s short coat doesn’t require haircuts- you’ll just need to ensure that your pup’s nails are clipped regularly.
One thing to be wary of before buying or adopting a Lab is the fact that their coats shed a lot. You’ll need to vacuum your home regularly, though brushing daily can help get rid of the loosest hair.
Because they were bred to be calm and easy to socialize, Labrador Retrievers aren’t considered an overly vocal breed.
If your Lab’s barking is posing an issue, consistent training with reinforcement should be enough to tackle the problem.
Male adult Labrador Retrievers typically weigh between 29.5 kg and 36 kg (65 and 80 pounds), while females weigh between 25 and 31 kg (55 and 70 pounds).
This large breed can stand up to 55 to 62 cm (24.5 inches) tall, with females being generally smaller than males.
These high energy dogs are some of the easiest to train. A happy Labrador is one that’s kept engaged and occupied, so when it comes to mental stimulation, it’s the more, the better.
To avoid your Lab from exhibiting territorial or food aggression in adulthood, it’s essential to train him well. Consistent training with plenty of positive reinforcement should do the trick!
Labradors tend to be easygoing and calm. Though they’re known for their loyalty, they will sometimes need their own space.
Labs are also highly intelligent, which makes them easy to train. They are capable of performing all kinds of tasks, from search and rescue to complex puzzles.
This breed is also sociable. So when you bring the Labrador Retriever breed into your home, you can expect it to get on well with your other pets, as well members of your household.
As their name indicates, Labs were bred to be retrievers. There’s nothing a Lab loves more than a game of fetch, though be warned; you might have trouble getting the ball back once your Labrador has found it!
Although the Labrador Retriever is an overall healthy breed, like with any breed, they are predisposed to certain conditions. Some health issues that commonly affect Labs are:
To ensure that your Labrador gets the best treatment if faced with an unexpected illness, it’s important to purchase pet insurance, just like with other dogs. Though plans vary, insurance can cover up to 90% of your vet’s bills.
Provided they maintain a healthy weight and get the right amount of exercise, a Labrador Retriever can live to the age of 10 or 12 years.
Generally, large breed dogs have shorter lifespans than small breeds. This is because larger dogs age more quickly than their smaller counterparts, and this makes fatal health conditions more likely.
When it comes to feeding a Labrador Retriever, there are a few different dog food options to choose from.
You can feed your dog wet food, kibble (dry dog food), cooked food or raw food. These options vary in price but should all provide your Labrador with the nutrients they need.
To keep mealtimes interesting, most owners opt for a combination of different foods, for example, a bowl with half kibble and half wet food twice a day.
We recommend choosing high-quality puppy food for young pups because the early stages are crucially important in your Lab’s development.
Because they’re so high in demand, Labs aren’t a cheap choice of pet. Given how much it costs to look after a dog, it’s essential to consider your financial stability before buying or adopting a Labrador Retriever.
When shopping for a Labrador pup, avoid breeders that offer suspiciously low prices. Though the bargain may be tempting, puppy farms breed in unethical conditions. Your pup may have even inherited health conditions that you’re unaware of.
In Australia, a Labrador puppy costs between $2,000 and $5,000. The exact amount you pay will vary depending on factors like bloodlines, sex and location.
Due to their high intelligence, Labrador Retriever puppies are easy to train. If disobedience is an issue, ensuring your pup gets plenty of exercise should help to keep it calm during training sessions.
If your Lab’s only type of exertion is walking, he will require two walks per day. This should total a minimum of 80 minutes of high-intensity exercise, though this can vary slightly between dogs.
To ensure your pet gets adequate exercise, we recommend engaging them in energetic play and canine sports in addition to walks.
Because adopted Lab puppies are more sought after, shelters are often full of adult dogs in need of a loving and stable home.
Although an adult may prove harder to train than young Labrador puppies, most dogs will have received some training in their previous home or shelter. Furthermore, because the rescue dog is already fully grown, you know what to expect in terms of size and personality.
Adopting a fully grown dog can be a great option for pet lovers.
Though they’re calmer than other dog breeds (like Border Collies and Cockapoos), Labrador Retrievers generally have a lovable nature. This makes them an excellent family pet.
Though they often have an independent streak, Labrador dogs are loyal and certainly friendly.
