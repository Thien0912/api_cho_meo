British Shorthair of Silver Shaded, Point and Chinchilla Color:
Popularity rating of the British Shorthair cats is very high, and the number of owners is enormous. British Shorthairs are the classic of feline nobility! Representatives of this breed are incredibly tempting; their appearance is impressive and majestic. Their unobtrusive ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù over the life of the family, philanthropy, the ability to display their beauty, ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù in the family affairs due to all of this there is a growing number of the British Shorthair fans!
The Chinchilla/Silver Shaded British Shorthair color has been very popular overseas since it was first recognized in 1980 by both breeders and Cat lovers thanks to its¬† beauty, refined manners and wonderful, kind nature. However, despite its many positive features, the Chinchilla/Silver Shaded British Shorthair is more rare to find in the US.¬† Its popularity and uniqueness is just coming to be desired by both breeders and cat lovers here in the past few years.
With in the silver gene lines there are many names used for the these cats ‚Ä¶ I would like to just take a little bit of time to kinda talk about the tantamount differences that many are not aware of .. including some breeders.¬† A very good friend and fellow breeder, Dr. Doug Schar and I are actually working on a project to make 2 pamphlets about this across the silver gene cat breeds.¬† Once we get more information, for there is very little info on silvers out there, we will make it available for all to see.¬† One Pamphlet will be simple terms all can understand and another for those that want to go more in depth as to the why. But in the mean time since I get so many people contacting me saying they would like a silver shaded chinchilla, which is really two different colors of cat and so on. I thought this might help a bit for those out in search of their new Silver colored British Shorthair Cat.
Number one difference but hard for most to see ‚Ä¶ Chinchillas will only have about 1/8th or less of upper hair shaft tipped in color. Silver Shaded will have at least 1/4th to 1/3 of upper hair shaft tipped in color.
Another note is that Chinchilla and Shaded is actually a pattern not a color.
Almost always these little ones will have a very beautiful darker makeup liner around their eyes, nose and sometimes mouth.
Ok so now what does this mean üôÇ

Silver Chinchilla ‚Ä¶.. will have a very light to no shading color ‚Ä¶ appearing more like a white cat. Normally has green eyes





Silver Chinchilla Point ‚Ä¶ same as above but will have some darker shading color normally, on some or all of their points ( Ears, Face, Tails, Legs) normally always with blue eyes.





Silver Shaded ‚Ä¶.¬† ¬†will have much more shading 1/4 to 1/3 of upper hair shaft will be colored.. but that can range a lot by what color of shading they have (this is true with the Chinchilla as well). A Black will be darker on the tips then a Blue or chocolate‚Ä¶ It looks like someone poured a bit of whatever the color is all over the top of them‚Ä¶White on the underside but with that little dusting over the top. They are normally always born with color already on them and lighten up a bit with age. They normally always have Green eyes.





Silver Shaded Point¬† ‚Ä¶ They are born pure white or cream color and than around 2 weeks old coloring will start to appear. They mostly appear much more white than the Silver Shaded but their points will have the darker coloring with maybe a very slight dusting on the top. They normally always have blue eyes.




The Photo of the two kittens is to show the difference and how noticeable a Chinchilla is compared to a Silver Point laying side by side.¬† The red collar kitten is a Silver Chinchilla Point the Orange Collar kitten is a Silver Shaded Point. They were both born all white but after only a few weeks color started developing in the Silver Shaded Point.¬† The kittens are about 4 weeks old in this photo. These two girls are sisters but look totally different.




The Big Boy at the back is a Silver Shaded (green eyes)¬† he is actually a long hair
The next two next to him are Silver Chinchilla Points
And the two in the front are Silver Lynx Points.
The only color/pattern missing in this photo is the Silver Shaded Point.



Standard/Traditional :¬† Born with darker color on them but will lighten up over time.¬† They normally look like a little tabby or marble color at birth than lighten up as they get older.¬† They will normally have green eyes.




Color Point :¬† Born totally white but within a few weeks will begin to show color shading ‚Ä¶ this shading will change due to temperature.¬† Darker when cold .. Lighter when Warm.¬† They can have an overall shading but most always will be darker on their points.¬† They always have blue eyes.¬† For more in depth about color points click here.












Torbie .. They have a marble like pattern on them .. normally always female .. this photo is a male.. very rare to see a male Torbie






Ticked or Tabby ‚Ä¶ They are striped all over compared to the Lynx






Chinchilla¬†‚Ä¶¬† They have very little shading on the very tips of the hair shaft. normally 1/8th are less is shaded on the tips. So they look mostly white





Silver Shaded¬†..¬† They have much more shading then the chinchilla .. 1/4th or more of the tips of hair shafts are shaded.¬† So the shading is much more noticeable.





All the photos of the different patterns are a form of the silver gene BSHs ‚Ä¶ so there is a wide range both in color and pattern. There is actually other patterns but these are the ones that I breed.
The other issue I have ran across is that there are many names for the same colored cat across the breeds in the silvers ‚Ä¶ so even within the British Shorthair you will see a Chinchilla called a Silver Tipped, Shell and so on this is normally due to it being from another breed and the name just stuck.¬† This is why Doug and I have decided to join forces in order to try and get a better understanding from the confusion even within the cat world and judging of the Silvers. So that it is more uniformed and easier across the board.


History of Chinchillas and Silver Shaded British Shorthairs:
Origin is British Isles, where thousands of years ago their ancestors inhabited it. British shorthair ‚Äì is a harmonious, medium or large sized animal with a muscular, solid, well-developed body; strong legs; powerful chest; round head with big cheeks; short and thick neck.
British Shorthair breeder Norman Winder derived British Shorthair Chinchillas in the early 1970‚Äôs. He made a crossbreeding of Persian Chinchilla with a British Shorthair cat. His experiment was a full success: in 1973, Winder demonstrated at the exhibition a new breed that was named British Shorthair black tipped or ‚ÄúBritish Shorthair black silver tipped (Silver Shaded)‚Äù. The Board of Cat Clubs, England, recognized this color in 1980. Since this time due to other excellent breeders the Silver Shaded and Chinchilla British Shorthair has came along way and some exquisite color patterns and colors are now making there way to Cat Shows and Loving homes.
The name¬† ‚Äúchinchilla‚Äù came about because of this color resembling the color of the fur of these funny animals.¬† Since the modern British Shorthair Silver Shaded and chinchilla has among their ancestors of the Persians and Exotics, this breed is both longhair and shorthair.

British Shorthair Silver Shaded/Chinchilla Temperament:
Currently, because of the exquisite form inherited from the Persians calm and balanced nature, the British Shorthair Silver Shaded, Lynx and Chinchilla is in high demand. They are worthy favorites of the breed and pride of their owners. Good manners of British Shorthair in their blood. They feel themselves perfectly at home in a city apartment or country house; easily get along with other cats and dogs. You can feel their wise, innate intelligence, dedication and kindness. And due to the Persian in them these Silver beauties tend to be much more affectionate then their counter parts and love to be held and cuddled. British Shorthair cats do not lose their temper easily; they are calm and yet very playful. These cats will please and surprise you. They will not sit long in your lap, but more likely will lie by you and enjoy your closeness. They are extremely loyal and affectionate. Many say the Silver Shaded/ Chinchillas British Shorthair are more dog like, being a Faithful, Loyal and Loving companion but yet still have the independence of a cat :), and so easy to train to different tricks. I have found this to be very true with my little ones .. they sleep with me and love to cuddle, play and stay close to me most of the time. But still love to explore and play on their own as well.

Silver Bengal cats are a type of Bengal cat with silver markings. These markings were introduced into some lines of the Bengal through interbreeding with American Shorthairs. They act much like Bengal cats, but they have silver tabby markings. Because of their unique coat, the silver Bengal cat is rare and extremely expensive.
Height:
12‚Äì16 inches
Weight:
8‚Äì18 pounds
Lifespan:
12‚Äì16 years
Colors:
Spotted marble; brown, silver, snow
Suitable for:
Small families with plenty of space, experienced cat owners looking for a challenge
Temperament:
Willful, wild, mischievous, and entertaining
Much of their history is shared with the Bengal cat, which is a relatively newer breed.

A Bengal is a mix between a domestic cat and an Asian Leopard cat. Silver Bengal cats occur when just the right American Shorthair is bred with a Bengal. However, even then, these cats do not always occur with the proper pairing. It is all a matter of what traits the kittens inherit, which is all a game of chance.
Silvers are created by an inhibitor gene known as ‚ÄúI‚Äù. This is a dominant gene that inhibits (but does not fully eliminate) warm pigment or yellow pigment in the cat‚Äôs hair while leaving black pigment. One copy of the gene can cause the loss of pigment, but a cat with two copies of the mutation will have less yellow/red pigment and less color overall.
The Bengal was first mentioned in 1889. However, we do not know how long they existed before that. There is some possibility that Asian Leopard Cats and Domestic cats were bred together throughout history as soon as domestic felines were common enough. Just like random crossing between wolves and domestic dogs occurs, wild cats and domestic cats may occasionally breed as well.
However, there was not much purposeful breeding during the early years. In fact, all early accounts stopped after only a generation or two. It seems that the Bengal breed did not catch on until much later.
Jean Mill was the first known American to deliberately cross an Asian Leopard Cat with a domestic cat. However, this feline was a black tomcat, so that first crossing would not have produced a Silver Bengal. She bred cats together off and on for a number of years. However, the breed did not begin gaining in popularity until much later.
In 1970, Jean Mill began another attempt at creating the Bengal cat. She received a group of Bengal cats that had been used in genetic testing studies. She used these cats as the basis for her population. However, at this time, other breeders began creating these mixed cats as well.

The Silver Bengal is not recognized as its own breed of cat. Instead, it is mixed in with all other Bengal cats.
Bengals were accepted by The International Cat Association in 1986. However, they did not gain championship status until 1991. In 1997, they were accepted by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.
Many other cat clubs followed these first two. Today, most associations have this breed on their registry. However, some have very strict guidelines regarding what cats can be registered. Usually, they have to be later-generation felines, as ‚Äúearly-generation‚Äù cats are typically prone to infertility.

Instead, they have a raspy voice that sounds closer to a bark. It isn‚Äôt exactly a roar either, which is what many people expect from a cat with wild ancestry!
They are known for turning light switches on and off and turning on faucets. Therefore, they must be watched closer than your average cat.
A Silver Bengal can easily cost $10,000. Regular Bengals are plenty expensive, but Silver Bengals are typically even more so.
Over the years, many people attempted to start this breed. However, it only recently took off. Therefore, there are many older Bengal cats that the modern breed is no longer related to.

Many people covet Silver Bengals due to their wild and unforgettable look. However, these cats are not necessarily the easiest to own. They are extremely intelligent, which means that they require more stimulation and tend to cause more trouble. They are known for figuring out do and other household gadgets. Therefore, they usually need to be supervised a bit more closely. Many people describe them as athletic 3-year-olds!
They are also extremely energetic. Therefore, you have to purchase many climbing structures to keep them happy. Without the proper care, they can be a bit more destructive. They will climb just about anything, including your curtains. For this reason, they are often considered high maintenance.

Silver Bengals are a subset of the Bengal cat, which is a modern crossbreed between an Asian leopard cat and a domestic feline. Typically, the domestic cat is a male since many male Bengals are infertile. These cats are extremely expensive due to their rarity. Because a wild cat is used to create the breed, it usually costs breeders quite a bit to produce kittens, contributing to the high price.
Silver Bengals are even more expensive. Therefore, they cost quite a bit more money.

As gorgeous as they are affectionate, the ever-stunning Persian cat becomes even more so when covered in a luxurious silver coat. Silver Persians have been delighting pet lovers for over a century, giving enthusiastic owners one of the most attractive felines and breeding experts an undeniably captivating variety to draw more interest to the breed.
From their sparkling coats to their adoring personalities, Silver Persians are magnificent inside and out. Let‚Äôs look at the traits and lifestyle of the Silver Persian cat and discover why many breed experts enthusiastically agree that these are the ‚ÄúCadillac of cats.‚Äù
Height:
8‚Äì10 inches
Weight:
7‚Äì12 pounds
Lifespan:
11‚Äì15 years
Colors:
Chinchilla silver, shaded silver, blue Chinchilla silver, blue shaded silver

Temperament:
Playful, loving, relaxed, quiet, intelligent, friendly
The Silver Persian cat is a color variety of the Persian breed. The long-haired cat takes on a shimmering silver appearance, which many regard as the most dazzling and regal of all Persian coats. There are two varieties, Chinchilla Silvers and Shaded Silvers, which share similar origins and general traits.
Silver Persians achieve their classic elegance through stunning points of contrast. The round eyes stand out in remarkable shades of green and blue-green, while a brick-red nose sits below. Black outlines emphasize these and the lips, making the already mesmerizing eyes stand out even further and sharply defining every subtle change in facial expression.

While the Persian breed dates to the 1600s, silver-coated cats didn‚Äôt garner significant recognition until the 1800s. The Chinchilla Silver Persian cats began with Chinnie, a female born in England in 1882. Chinnie‚Äôs unique coloration captured her owner‚Äôs interest, and she soon mated with another Silver with tabby markings named Fluffy I.
Sadly, Fluffy I and many of Chinnie‚Äôs offspring met untimely ends due to various accidents, leaving only her first female, Beauty. Beauty would go on to have several litters. In 1890, her second mating produced Silver Lambkin, a legendary champion and the first of the Chinchilla Silvers.
Silver Lambkin sired numerous cats that would significantly impact the breed‚Äôs development, and many modern silver cats can trace their lineages to him and his relatives.
Silver Lambkin and his offspring, notably Lord Argent and Champion Lord Southampton, were highly influential, appearing in the pedigrees of many modern Silvers. At this time, crossings with blues, Silver Tabbies, and other varieties found their way into the silver lines.
Spreading Silver Lambkin‚Äôs influence, much of Lord Southampton‚Äôs offspring moved across the ocean to develop silver lines in the U.S. by the turn of the century. Lord Argent also came to America in 1901 with his owner and founder of the Silver Society, Mrs. Florence Champion, to establish the Argent line. The Silver Persian‚Äôs popularity quickly took off, so much so that Silver Lambkin‚Äôs death in 1906 was significant news on both sides of the pond.
Following Chinnie‚Äôs birth in 1882, interest in Silver Persians grew, and the offshoot received its first standalone class at the Crystal Palace Show in 1894. Although detailed records are sparse, many believe Silvers earned recognition upon the Cat Fanciers‚Äô Association‚Äôs founding in 1906.
Over the years, confusion and lack of agreement over definitions have caused Silvers to move in and out of classes of various color-type combinations. Silver Tabby, Smoke, Cameo, Tortoiseshell, and other Persians mingled in shared divisions as judges struggled to consistently and logically define the differences.
Smokes and Cameos were in the Shaded Division with Silvers until 1965 when Smokes got their separate division. In 1977, Golden Persian cats (a recessive variation of silver that produces golden tipping) gained CFA recognition and joined the Shaded Division. Finally, Silvers and Goldens broke from the rest in the mid-1990s, giving us today‚Äôs categorizations.

The distinction between the different colors and classifications has been up for debate since the earliest Silver Persians. Many people, including judges, can‚Äôt decide where a Chinchilla ends and a Shaded begins. The confusion continues today, as some Silver Persians earn a ‚Äúneither/nor‚Äù designation, meaning they don‚Äôt clearly fit either mold. Though they‚Äôre difficult to interpret, purists say cats should be distinguishable as a Chinchilla or Shaded from a distance.
The darker coat and markings are the first features you might notice with a Silver Persian kitten. If your cat is a Chinchilla Silver, they‚Äôre often born with a Mackerel Tabby pattern featuring slender stripes and spots.
Shaded Silvers usually have the blotchy pattern of a Classic Tabby. Though the patterns are well-defined on kittens, the coat lightens, and the markings disappear after around 10 weeks as the hair grows out.

Persians have some of the most pleasant personalities of any breed, and the silver-coated variety is no exception. Though sometimes aloof with strangers, they‚Äôre easy to get along with and rarely get too loud or temperamental.
Silvers have a reputation for being more intelligent and active than other Persians, but they‚Äôre still more relaxed than the average cat. In most cases, they‚Äôre happiest lounging with their favorite person. Many owners even consider them similar to little dogs with their tendency to shadow their owners.
Grooming is usually the most demanding part of owning a Silver. A Persian is a high-maintenance shedder requiring daily grooming. Getting them comfortable with the routine at a young age is crucial. Despite the added challenges, tending to a Chinchilla Persian is also extra-rewarding, as the groomed-out coat creates a gorgeous cloud of delicate silver-tipped hair.

Regal, exquisite, ethereal. You can pick any of the most common descriptors, and they all point to the Silver Persian being almost too good to be true. For over a century, Chinchilla and Shaded Silvers have brought their unique appeal to the cat fancy, garnering much debate over the years and plenty of appreciation from avid fans worldwide. With a radiant beauty and an enchanting personality to match, Silver Persians make a delightful addition to nearly any household.

Regardless of the species, they come in diverse sizes and can boast either short or long, luxurious fur. Each one tells a unique story through its gaze and markings, captivating the hearts of those lucky enough to encounter them.
It is thought that domestic cats originated in the Near East around 10,000 years ago. Their genetic makeup changed as they dispersed over the globe, giving rise to various coat types, including tabby. Among domestic cats‚Äô most famous and ancient coat patterns is the tabby.
Although its origins are unclear, the silver tabby cat is said to have started in the United Kingdom in the middle of the 1800s. Most likely, Persian and Angora cats crossed to produce the first silver tabbies. During the Victorian era, these early silver tabbies were highly fashionable and frequently appeared in paintings and cat exhibits.
The selective breeding of silver tabbies started in the early 1900s. Silver tabbies with brilliant silver markings and pure white undercoats piqued the curiosity of breeders. Cat registries worldwide acknowledged silver tabbies as a legitimate breed by the 1920s.
When it comes to the breeds of this particular cat, it is known to have three common species worldwide. These breeds are a little different from each other, but it still needs to be more challenging to diagnose them. Have a look at these breeds and a little information about these cats.

Mealtimes become more than just food when you establish their regular feeding routine. At the same time, it is a valued time of attention and sustenance for the cat because of this consistency, which creates a feeling of order and calms its thoughts.
As we know the coats make it more recognizable among the people, a cat‚Äôs coat, with its silken strands whispering tales of elegance and grace, begs for a tender hand and soft touch. So, grooming is an act of reverence, a gentle moment between like spirits that entails more than just brushing away mats and knots.
A silver tabby cat‚Äôs well-being is a form of representing affection, attention, and watchfulness. Frequent veterinarian checkups turn into comforting moments as worried eyes meet kind experts, making sure that every pulse beats with life.
