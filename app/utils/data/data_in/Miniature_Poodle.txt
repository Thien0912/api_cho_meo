Poodles come in all shapes and sizes, and if you’re looking for a smaller Poodle, the Miniature Poodle is a great choice. They’re not the smallest Poodles in the world, as the Toy Poodle is smaller, but they’re still pretty small, smart, and lovable. There’s plenty to love about these pups, and it’s why they’re among the most popular dog breeds in the world right now!
Height:
10–15 inches
Weight:
10–15 pounds
Lifespan:
10–18 years
Colors:
Apricot, black, blue, brown, cream, red, silver, silver beige, white, café au lait, and gray
Suitable for:
Active families, those with mild pet allergies, families with children, and single-pet homes
Temperament:
Loyal, loving, intelligent, easy to train, vocal, and high-energy
Miniature Poodles are simply Poodles that are between 10 and 15 pounds, but in many other ways, they’re identical to the other sizes of Poodles (Standard and Toy). They’re the second smartest dogs in the world, and they want to hang out with their owners as much as possible.1
Poodles are the best possible combination of showmanship and companionship, and since they’re considered more hypoallergenic than other breeds (although no dog is truly hypoallergenic), they’re a wise choice for people with mild pet allergies.

Poodles of all sizes are incredibly popular in the United States and abroad, making it relatively easy to find a reputable breeder. Because you can find a fair number of Miniature Poodle breeders, we highly recommend being as picky as possible when vetting one.
Ensure you get a health guarantee and references, and that you can check out the facilities before purchasing one. Aim for a breeder that raises them in their home so they are well-socialized with humans and other pets. You want to do everything you can to avoid puppy mills, as this is what’s best for the breed and ensures you get a happy, healthy, and well-adjusted puppy.
You also might be able to find a Miniature Poodle in a shelter, but it’s very likely that these dogs will not be purebred, which can make it a bit more challenging to determine exactly what you’re getting and can lead to health issues—which costs more money—in the future.

With a sweet nature and eagerness to please their owners, it’s tough to find a dog that gets along with everyone as well as the Miniature Poodle. Not only are they sweet and loving, but they’re among the smartest dogs on the planet and can pick up on training in no time.
In fact, according to Stanley Coren’s dog intelligence ranking, the Miniature Poodle comes in second, only coming behind the Border Collie in overall intelligence. Whether you’re looking for a dog to cuddle up with on the couch or a dog that you can teach all sorts of complicated tricks, a Miniature Poodle is a wise choice.
Miniature Poodles are the ideal family dog. They generally get along great with kids of all ages, and while they might prefer one owner over another, they really are affectionate with everyone in the family.
Early socialization is still critical, though, and you should remain cautious around smaller children who might fall into them while learning to walk and accidentally hurt them. Miniature Poodles are pretty nimble and quick, but even they can’t avoid every move from a child.
While the Miniature Poodle often gets along with other pets, it’s not a sure thing. Early socialization can help quite a bit, and if you keep up with this, you can usually keep them with other pets. This is true for other dogs, cats, and smaller pets, but just keep in mind that every dog has its own personality, so make introductions the right way and never leave a Miniature Poodle alone with smaller pets.

While owning a Miniature Poodle is similar to owning any other type of dog, there are a few unique things you should be aware of. We don’t want you to encounter any unexpected surprises, which is why we took the time to go over some of the basics for you below.
Because of their smaller size, it shouldn’t cost you too much to properly feed a Miniature Poodle. However, it’s essential to get them a high-quality diet that meets all their nutritional needs. While you might need to spend a little more on this upfront, it’s going to keep your pup healthier and happier, plus it will save you money on future vet bills. Just be sure to follow your vet’s guidance, as well as the feeding guidelines on the packaging of your food of choice.
Not only does a Miniature Poodle not eat as much because of their smaller size, but it’s also easier to hit their daily exercise needs. The Miniature Poodle can be a relatively high-energy breed, but you can meet most of their energy requirements in your home by playing games like fetch. However, it’s still important to get them out for walks, and we recommend at least two walks a day, and each walk should last at least 15 minutes.
Miniature Poodles are eager to please and as smart as they come, two characteristics that make training comparatively easy. However, you still need to set aside the time to train them, and you must stay consistent with it.
Aim for one or two training sessions per day, each lasting about 5 to 10 minutes. Stick solely to positive reinforcement, minimize distractions, and bring some of their favorite treats to get the most out of each session and encourage them to keep trying.
As a “hypoallergenic” breed that doesn’t shed much, a Miniature Poodle has unique grooming requirements in that you’ll need to take them for monthly haircuts or do it yourself. You’ll also need to brush them out daily to keep their fur from matting. Plus, you should brush their teeth once a day to keep up with their oral hygiene. Finally, trim their nails as needed, or let the groomer handle it when you take them in for their monthly haircuts.
While there’s a fair amount of health conditions that can affect a Miniature Poodle, if you get your pup from a reputable breeder, it’s not something you should have to worry too much about. However, it’s still a good idea to know what to keep an eye out for, even if it is relatively unlikely that your dog will develop any serious conditions.
Minor Conditions

 Allergies
 Eye problems

Serious Conditions

 Cushing’s disease
 Epilepsy
 Hip dysplasia
 Progressive retinal atrophy
 Hypothyroidism



Male vs. Female
There aren’t too many differences between a male and female Miniature Poodle. Males tend to stand a little bit taller than females from the same litter, but because Poodles can vary so much in size, their genetics tend to play a larger role than their gender.


3 Little-Known Facts About the Miniature Poodle
1. Their Coats Never Stop Growing
Miniature Poodles don’t shed much, but their coats never stop growing. This is why frequent grooming is so important. Otherwise, their constantly growing coat will turn into quite a mess and lead to painful mats.

2. They’re Popular Show Dogs
Between their smaller size, eagerness to please, high intelligence, and cuteness, it’s really no surprise that you can find all sorts of Miniature Poodles in the show ring. However, the last Miniature Poodle to win in the show was Surrey Spice Girl in 2002.

3.  They Started as Standard Poodles
While you can find Poodles in three different sizes today, at one point, they were all Standard Poodles! Standard Poodles can weigh up to 70 pounds, making them seven times larger than many Miniature Poodles.

Final Thoughts
Even if you don’t want your very own Miniature Poodle, there’s no denying how many amazing traits they have. They’re great for people with pet allergies and are highly trainable, affectionate, and downright cute, so it’s no surprise that these dogs are so popular.
They’re still quite the commitment, though, so ensure you can care for them for 10 to 15 years before you decide to bring one home yourself.

Ensuring your dog receives the appropriate vaccinations is a fundamental aspect of responsible pet ownership. Vaccinations, often referred to as dog immunisations, play a crucial role in safeguarding your canine companion against a variety of serious and potentially fatal diseases. In this expert guide, we'll delve into the essential vaccinations for dogs in the UK, discuss the importance of annual shots for dogs, and address common concerns such as the side effects of puppy vaccinations.
Why Are Dog Vaccinations Important?
Vaccinating your dog is essential for several reasons:


Disease Prevention: Vaccinations protect dogs from contagious diseases that can lead to severe illness or death.

Public Health: Some canine diseases can be transmitted to humans; vaccinations help reduce this risk.

Legal Requirements: Certain vaccinations are required by law, especially if you plan to travel with your dog.

Core Vaccinations for Dogs in the UK

In the UK, there are core vaccines that are highly recommended for all dogs due to the prevalence and severity of the diseases they prevent. So, what vaccinations do dogs need in the UK?


Canine Distemper Virus: A highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.

Canine Parvovirus: A severe viral disease causing gastrointestinal illness in puppies and young dogs.

Infectious Canine Hepatitis (Adenovirus): Affects the liver, kidneys, and eyes.

Leptospirosis: A bacterial infection that can affect both dogs and humans.

These dog vaccinations are typically administered as a combined injection, often referred to as the DHP vaccine.
Non-Core Vaccinations
Depending on your dog's lifestyle and environment, additional dog injections may be recommended:


Kennel Cough (Bordetella bronchiseptica and Canine Parainfluenza Virus): Advised if your dog frequently interacts with other dogs, especially in kennels or dog parks.

Rabies: Mandatory if you're planning to travel abroad with your dog.

Puppy Vaccination Schedule

Starting vaccinations at the right age is crucial for effective immunity.


First Set of Vaccinations: Puppies should receive their first dog jabs at around 6-8 weeks of age. Puppies are often given their first vaccination whilst they're still with their breeder before they come home, check with your breeder when you're buying a puppy as to their vaccination status and make sure you bring home any vaccination records.

Second Set: A follow-up injection is given at 10-12 weeks.

Booster: An additional booster may be administered at 16 weeks depending on the brand of vaccine your vet has used.

It's important to adhere to this schedule to ensure your puppy develops strong immunity against these diseases.
Do Dogs Need Annual Vaccinations?
A common question among pet owners is, "Do dogs need annual vaccinations?" The answer is generally yes. After the initial puppy vaccinations, dogs require annual shots to maintain their immunity.


Annual Boosters: These are essential to reinforce your dog's immunity against diseases.

Health Check-ups: Annual visits allow the vet to perform a full health assessment.

Skipping annual dog injections can leave your pet vulnerable to diseases, so maintaining a regular vaccination schedule is highly recommended.
Cost of Boosters for Dogs

Understanding the cost of boosters for dogs helps in planning your pet care budget.


Average Cost: In the UK, booster vaccinations can range from £30 to £60.

Factors Influencing Cost: The price may vary depending on the veterinary practice and the specific vaccines required.

Wondering how much are boosters for dogs? It's best to consult your local vet for precise pricing. Some vets offer a pet plan which is a monthly payment that usually covers your dog’s annual vaccination and their flea and worming medication and often can work out cheaper than paying for them individually. Sometimes the pet plan will also have other benefits like discounts off the shop at your vets or a free 6 monthly health check up for your dog so it’s definitely worth checking with your vet to see what their pet plan covers.
Side Effects of Puppy Vaccinations in the UK
While vaccinations are generally safe, some puppies may experience mild side effects.


Common Side Effects: Lethargy, slight fever, and soreness at the injection site.

Serious Reactions: Rarely, allergic reactions can occur, characterised by swelling, vomiting, or difficulty breathing.

If you notice any severe side effects of puppy vaccinations, contact your vet immediately.
What Are Dogs Vaccinated Against?
To summarise, what are dogs vaccinated against in the UK?


Core Diseases: Distemper, Parvovirus, Hepatitis, and Leptospirosis.

Non-Core Diseases: Kennel Cough and Rabies (if necessary).

These vaccinations are critical in protecting your dog from debilitating diseases.
Tips for a Smooth Vaccination Experience



Stay Calm: Dogs can sense your anxiety; staying relaxed helps keep them calm.

Post-Vaccination Care: Monitor your dog for any adverse reactions after the dog injection.

Keep Records: Maintain a vaccination record for reference and future appointments.

Conclusion
Vaccinations are a vital component of your dog's overall health care plan. Regular dogs annual injections not only protect your pet but also contribute to the wellbeing of the canine community by preventing disease outbreaks. Consult your veterinarian to establish a vaccination schedule tailored to your dog's specific needs.

Celebrating your dog's birthday or a special milestone is a joyous occasion. What better way to include your furry friend in the festivities than with a homemade dog birthday cake? Baking a cake for dogs is not only a fun activity but also ensures your pet enjoys a treat that's both delicious and safe. In this guide, we'll walk you through a dog-friendly birthday cake recipe and provide tips on creating cakes that dogs can eat.
Why Not Share Your Cake with Your Dog?
You might wonder, "Can a dog eat cake meant for humans?" While it might be tempting to give your dog a slice of your own birthday cake, it's important to resist. Regular cakes often contain ingredients like sugar, chocolate, and artificial sweeteners, which can be harmful to dogs. To keep your pet healthy and happy, it's best to opt for a dog-safe cake recipe.
Essential Ingredients for a Dog Cake

When preparing a cake recipe for dogs, it's crucial to use ingredients that are safe and beneficial for them. Here are some dog-friendly ingredients to consider:


Whole Wheat Flour: A healthier alternative to white flour, providing more nutrients.

Peanut Butter: A favourite among dogs; ensure it's free from xylitol, an artificial sweetener toxic to dogs.

Applesauce or Pumpkin Puree: Adds moisture and flavour; make sure it's unsweetened and free from additives.

Eggs: A good source of protein.

Honey: In small amounts, it can add sweetness without the risks associated with sugar.

Dog Birthday Cake Recipe
Let's dive into a simple yet tasty dog cake recipe that your pet will love.
Ingredients:

1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup natural peanut butter (xylitol-free)
1/4 cup honey
1 egg
1/2 cup grated carrots (optional for added texture and nutrition)

Instructions:


Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a small cake pan.

Mix Dry Ingredients: In a bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and baking powder.

Combine Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, mix the applesauce, peanut butter, honey, and egg until well blended.

Blend Together: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Fold in the grated carrots if using.

Bake: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.

Cool Down: Allow the cake to cool completely before serving it to your dog.

Optional Frosting:
Mix plain Greek yogurt with a small amount of peanut butter for a dog-friendly frosting. Spread it over the cooled cake.
Tips for Making the Perfect Dog Cake



Portion Control: Even though it's a special treat, remember to serve appropriate portions to avoid overfeeding.

Storage: Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to three days or freeze portions for later use.

Customisation: Feel free to substitute ingredients based on your dog's preferences and dietary needs. For example, use pumpkin puree instead of applesauce or add blueberries for an antioxidant boost.

Alternative Cakes That Dogs Can Eat
If you're looking for other cakes that dogs can eat, consider these variations:


Banana Oat Cake: Combine mashed bananas, oat flour, and eggs for a simple, wholesome cake.

Meatloaf Cake: For dogs who prefer savoury treats, create a meatloaf using ground turkey, vegetables, and eggs, baked in a cake pan.

Sweet Potato Pupcakes: Use mashed sweet potatoes and rice flour to make cupcake-sized treats.

Do Dogs Eat Cake?
Yes, dogs can eat cake, but only if it's made with dog-safe ingredients. Avoid giving your dog regular cake intended for humans due to harmful components like sugar and chocolate.
Can a Dog Eat Cake Safely?

A dog can safely enjoy cake if it's specifically made for them using a dog-safe cake recipe. Always ensure that all ingredients are non-toxic and suitable for canine consumption.
Celebrating with a Dog-Friendly Birthday Cake
Creating a dog birthday cake is a wonderful way to show your pet how much they mean to you. Not only does it make the celebration special, but it also allows you to control the ingredients, ensuring your dog's health and happiness. Remember, the key to a successful dog cake is using wholesome, safe ingredients and serving it in moderation.

The Miniature Poodle is a size variant of the Poodle breed, which originated in Germany as a water retriever, or 'Pudel,' a term that means 'to splash in water'. Despite its German origin, the breed was standardized in France where it became the country's national dog. The Miniature Poodle was bred down from the Standard Poodle to accommodate urban living and to serve as a truffle hunter, due to their excellent sense of smell.
Miniature Poodles are susceptible to hip dysplasia, sebaceous adenitis, epilepsy, immune-mediated disorders, von Willebrand disease, eye disorders, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD), trichiasis, distichiasis, lacrimal duct atresia, entropion, glaucoma, cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, patellar luxation, and urinary stones. They are also prone to eye disorders such as progressive retinal atrophy, progressive rod-cone degeneration, and rod-cone dysplasia 4. Other specific conditions for which they should be genetically tested include congenital methemoglobinemia, degenerative myelopathy, and osteochondrodysplasia. As for all breeds, genetic screening is recommended to assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Miniature Poodles are intelligent, energetic, and sociable dogs. They excel in obedience and are highly trainable. Their alert and friendly nature often makes them excellent family pets. They're also known for their love of playing and need for regular mental and physical stimulation.Miniature Poodles have a dense, curly or corded coat. The fur is naturally hypoallergenic, making them a good choice for people with allergies. The coat is typically kept in specific cuts like the "puppy clip" or the more intricate "continental clip".
Miniature Poodles are sometimes affectionately referred to based on their coat colors like "Black Mini Poodle", "White Mini Poodle", etc.The Poodle is the national dog of France, however, in France they are known as Caniche or "duck dog." Miniature Poodles are often utilized as circus performers due to their intelligence, trainability, and agility.Despite their often sophisticated appearance, they are true athletes at heart, excelling at activities such as agility and obedience competitions.Poodles, including Miniature Poodles, are ranked as the second most intelligent dog breed, just after Border Collies.

How to find a puppy and raise a happy, healthy dog
April 28, 2023 By Caitlin Riffee 22 Comments
The Miniature Poodle dog breed is hard to beat when it comes to pets. A small, agile and intelligent pup with a low shedding, curly coat, this mini Poodle type has a playful, inquisitive personality and gets on well with people of all ages. Miniature Poodles have a range of colors including apricot, red, grey, brown and white, and patterns like parti. They reach up to 15 inches in height when full grown.  Despite its name and small size, they are the medium of three Poodle varieties. Much smaller than the Standard and a little bigger than the Toy. This family friendly, affectionate companion can also make a great working, retrieving, therapy or service dog too. A healthy, energetic, proud and elegant breed, they can live up to 18 years.
In the right home with an active family, the Miniature Poodle makes an excellent companion. If you want a pup that’s cute, loyal, child friendly, a breeze to train, and doesn’t take up much space. This could be your dream dog.
However, if you hate grooming and can’t afford a professional to clip your pet, or if you don’t like long walks or ball games, then you might need to think again. Despite being small enough for your lap, the fun loving mini poodle is more athlete than couch potato and needs an hour or so of exercise each day. Miniature Poodles excel at agility and obedience and will love to accompany you on a jog around the park.
The Miniature Poodle is a beautiful, curly-coated dog breed. Originally bred as a hunting companion, they now make loyal pets and intelligent agility dogs. Some may think of Poodles as divas who would rather sit pretty on a cushion than get dirty, but au contraire!
Poodles began as duck-hunting dogs nearly 400 years ago. Contrary to what some may think, these hunting dogs were bred in Germany, not France. That’s right, there’s no such thing as a French Poodle.
Even though their luxurious coats look ready for a show, they kept the water-loving dogs warm as they retrieved game for their masters. The Poodle’s ancestors rose in popularity across Europe, but not just as duck hunters. Poodles became known for their success as truffle hunters, military dogs and even circus dogs!
You don’t have to be a dog expert to know a Mini Poodle when you see one. Their curly coat is often clipped in distinctive patterns. Underneath all that fur is a surprisingly well built little dog.  The Mini Poodle has a square conformation so that its weight is evenly distributed across all four legs with no undue pressure on the dog’s back.  This give Poodles power and balance and enables them to jump much higher than their own body height, and to turn and twist at speed.
The Miniature Poodle has a nice level back, tight feet and an even gait which adds to the balanced, elegance of the dog. Their long straight muzzle enables the Poodle to cool efficiently and their bright intelligent button eyes are set in a pretty face framed by ears that hang neatly down on either side.
The result of this, even though it may be hidden under those gorgeous curls is a little athlete of a dog that is capable of both endurance, and of great bursts of energy.
Full grown, the Miniature Poodle may reach from 10 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder. Miniature Poodle weight ranges between 10 and 15 pounds.
A balanced diet appropriate to your dog’s age is important. You’ll want to monitor your dog’s caloric intake and weight. Don’t forget to include treats in that calculation.
Any dog will become overweight if fed too much or not given enough exercise. Because excess weight will exacerbate some of the health issues facing Miniature Poodles, it’s important to avoid it.
Miniature Poodles are typically a single solid color, with several beautiful shades that highlight their beautiful curls. Here are the coat colors for show-quality Miniature Poodles (those who meet registration requirements):
If a breeder tries to sell you a bicolored Miniature Poodle as show-quality, know that the AKC does not accept bicolored Miniature Poodles or any color other than those listed above.Sometimes, the color names used are more fun, such as mini chocolate Poodle for a brown pup.
How you keep a Miniature Poodle’s coat determines how much maintenance is needed.If you keep your pup fully furred and unclipped, her curls or waves will require daily brushing. The fur closest to her skin will quickly become matted if not carefully groomed.
Because of their high-maintenance coat, most owners opt to clip their pup. There are several popular cuts that require varying degrees of maintenance.
If you keep her coat clipped short overall, you may be able to get away with less brushing and combing.You’ll need to plan for visits to the groomer every four to six weeks to maintain the cut and trim her nails.
If you keep her coat partially clipped and partially long, then you’ll still need to maintain her long hair with daily brushing/combing. The clipped areas will need re-clipping every four to six weeks.
Their long and thick curly or wavy coat is iconic. Sometimes, you’ll see a Poodle with his hair clipped short. He may be only partially clipped, with only a few parts (typically the head, ears, chest, and legs) fully furred.
While this clip may seem like a fashion statement, it served a purpose back in the day. It protected the hunting dog’s vulnerable parts from cold and aided in swimming.
Today, clipping makes grooming easier for owners as their medium length coat requires regular attention. Regardless of how you keep his coat, a Miniature Poodle will bless you with a dramatic lack of shedding. He will still shed, but minimally: Every dog sheds at least a little.
Although they are a low shedding breed, they do still produce dander. This means that somone with a severe dog allergy could react to their salivia or contact with their fur.
Poodles are generally friendly, and the Mini Poodle is no exception. However, they can be a little shy and leery of strangers. That, combined with their love and loyalty to their owners, means that some may growl at strangers. In extreme cases, they may bite.
Therefore, it’s important that you socialize a Miniature Poodle with new people and animals from puppyhood onward. Other than a possible distrust of strangers, Poodles are very intelligent dogs who are eager to please. They are easy to train and enjoy having their smarts and retrieving capabilities put to the test!
Because they are so intelligent and eager to please, training is relatively easy. However, that intelligence requires that you are consistent and positive in your training efforts.
These dogs can be rather rambunctious little critters who enjoy about an hour of daily play time and plenty of interaction with their owners.
A bored Miniature Poodle will be an unhappy one, so this breed is best suited for a household that will keep them entertained, even if in short spurts.
Since their descendants were bred as working dogs, it’s natural that they prefer something to occupy their bodies and minds! Toss a toy around for a Mini Poodle, and he’ll be happy to continuously fetch it for you. Just be sure to let him take a quick power nap in your lap in between games of fetch.
Like any purebred dog, Miniature Poodles are susceptible to several inherited health conditions.  In addition to the health conditions found in those articles, they may also be prone to the following:
Generally found in small and older dogs, it’s caused by tumors on the adrenal gland. Once Cushing’s has been diagnosed, the dog may require lifelong medication, surgery to remove the tumor(s) and/or radiation therapy.
According to a 2002 study, Miniature Poodles seem prone to inherited diabetes. As with humans, diabetes in a dog requires lifelong insulin therapy.
A malfunction of a heart valve causing blood to leak from one chamber in the heart to another, often referred to as leaky valve disease.
This progressive condition is exactly what it sounds like. This makes the dog unable to breathe normally and may cause coughing. Medication is required to help the dog breathe normally, and surgery is a last resort to correct the deformity.
This is an inherited, allergic or secondary inflammation of the eyelid that closely resembles conjunctivitis (pink eye), in which the eyelid is red, swollen and itchy, sometimes with a clear or yellow discharge. Constant drainage can lead to loss of pigment or fur around the eye.
This is the spontaneous slippage or rupture of the discs that reside between the spinal vertebrae due to trauma or degeneration due to age. This is painful and can lead to hind-end paralysis. In some instances, genetic testing can identify dogs that carry the genes responsible for health problems. Dogs who are known carriers of these genes should not be used for breeding.
As a smaller dog, Miniature Poodles typically enjoy a longer life expectancy. Their lifespan ranges from 10 to 18 years. Most Mini Poodles live about 14 years and some make it all the way to 18!
Anyone can breed a dog and sell the puppies. In most countries, there are no laws restricting or regulating dog breeding. That means that there are good dog breeders and there are bad dog breeders.
The worst breeders don’t care about the animals other than how much money they can make. So, you need to pick your puppy supplier very carefully indeed. Be sure to do your research on breeders before selecting a Miniature Poodle puppy.
As mentioned, show-quality Poodles are one color, so be wary of any  breeders who advertise “show-quality” bicolored puppies. Select a breeder who uses genetic testing to prevent passing on undesired traits to help ensure the health of your puppy. Don’t be afraid to ask a lot of questions. Good breeders will appreciate your diligence.
A good breeder will keep their breeding stock and puppies healthy, at a good weight and in clean and spacious living conditions. Avoid any breeder whose dogs appear in poor health and/or dirty quarters.
These breeders may not want to let you see all their dogs. You should ask to see the mother with her pups. If the father is available, it’s good to meet him too.
Prices for Miniature Poodle puppies depend on how many are available, how much the breeder has invested in the puppies’ health and how valuable the parent dogs are to the breeder.
Additionally, some colors are more popular than others (hello, gorgeous apricot Poodles!). Therefore, you may pay more for a pup with a highly desired coat color.
Show-quality Miniature Poodle puppies will cost more than non-show-quality puppies.
In general, you can expect to pay anywhere from several hundred dollars to roughly $2,000 for a purebred Miniature Poodle puppy. Of course, you should understand what’s involved in raising a puppy before you bring one home.

We just lost our Clicquot a 16.5 year old mini-Poodle and we are heart-broken. We do have another dog at home, a 6 year old Chihuahua/Rat-Terrier. My wife has really been affected by this very recent loss, (10/02/2019) and I’m thinking of adopting a young female apricot mini-Poodle. My wife as yet knows nothing about this idea so this is all new and in about 6 months we are moving into a new house so my timing might not as yet be appropriate. This does give me time to research breeders, etc. We live in Florida. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I and my wife had our first miniature poodle for 14 years. Our Ceaser passed away in December of last year.  My wife and I were very upset and we wanted another miniature poodle as soon as possible.  We found Paris in May of this year.  She was bred by a very reputable breeder.  Like all miniature poodles she is friendly, very smart, and very loving but she does require attention which my wife and I are happy to give her.  We had Ceaser cremated and his ashes are with us.  Ceaser will never be forgotten and will always remain close in our hearts.
Paris is her own dog and is a happy 5 month old puppy now.  She is very smart and literally, with a little coxing, trained herself to do her duty outside.  My wife and I would never be without a miniature poodle as part of our household, which Paris has already become.  We still miss Ceaser, but Paris has helped fill the hole in our heart that Ceaser’s passing left.

Our extended family has had multiple miniature poodles (15+) over the years and never had one that was shy or leary of strangers. In fact, we have never met a mini that has been anything other than loving and outgoing with other people and dogs. They are very intelligent and quick learners that integrate with the family very well.

I have been trying to adopt a miniature poodle in the greater Washington DC area and so far have had no success. If you can help please let me know of places to apply. I am willing to travel a reasonable distance. I could buy a puppy but really would rather help an older dog in need of a loving home.

I have 10 mo old miniature apricot poodle. However,  he is not shy.  He wants (& does)  play with every dog at the park. As soon as I drive up the parking lot,  he’s whining to jump out of my vehicle.  He’s very social & vocal.  Heard a comment the other day,  ” Here comes bubbles! ” (his name is Ming but answers to bubbles, LOL). Pryor to Ming,  I had 2 mini-dachshunds & everyone told me they would be barking at everything & everyone.  But that was not the case. They were pretty low key. My poodle on the other hand,..yikes. Barks at every noise he hears when at home. (which I’m still trying to get used to)  That’s the only thing I’m having trouble trying to get under control.  Other than that,  he’s pretty obedient.  Let’s me know when he needs to potty.  Sits,  stays,  roll over & waits till I give notice to eat.  But the barking,….  help!
