Originating from the United Kingdom, Norwich Terriers were first bred in the late 19th century. They were developed in East Anglia, an area in England for which the city of Norwich was the main hub. These dogs were initially bred for their impressive rodent hunting abilities, making them an asset to stables and farms. They were also used for fox hunting due to their courage and determination.

It's interesting to note that the breed was often associated with students at Cambridge University, who kept these terriers as pets and mascots. In the early 20th century, they were known as Trumpington Terriers, named after Trumpington Street where many students resided.

Originally, Norwich Terriers and Norfolk Terriers were considered the same breed, known as Norwich Terriers. However, the two were officially separated in 1964 by The Kennel Club (UK), with the main difference being their ears: Norwich Terriers have prick ears, while Norfolk Terriers have drop ears. The American Kennel Club (AKC) followed suit in 1979.
Norwich Terriers are generally healthy, but can be prone to hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy, epilepsy, and upper airway syndrome. They may also suffer from patellar luxation, seizures, deafness, cheyletiella mites, allergies, and eye disorders such as primary lens luxation and cataracts. As for all breeds, genetic screening is recommended to assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Norwich Terriers are known for their energetic, affectionate, and intelligent nature. They are courageous dogs with a strong prey drive, but they are also friendly and adaptable. Their small size makes them suitable for both city living and country life.Despite their hunting roots, they are generally good with other dogs and animals if properly socialized. Norwich Terriers are good with children, but as with any breed, it's important to teach children how to approach and touch dogs to prevent any mishaps.Like other terriers, they can be somewhat independent and may exhibit stubbornness, so positive reinforcement training methods work best. They're also quite alert and make good watchdogs, though they're too small to serve as effective guard dogs.
Norwich Terriers are one of the smallest terriers, typically weighing between 10-12 pounds.Before the breed was officially separated into the Norwich and Norfolk Terrier, they were often called the Cantab Terrier or the Trumpington Terrier. "Jones Terriers" was another nickname, originating from their association with Cambridge University.Despite their small size, Norwich Terriers are excellent diggers, a trait useful for their original work flushing out rodents.The Norwich Terrier's likeness was featured on a postage stamp in Kyrgyzstan in 2014.A Norwich Terrier named "Willum" was a frequent companion of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.

Along with its close relative, the Norfolk Terrier, the Norwich Terrier is one of the smallest working terrier breeds. These active little dogs were first bred to eliminate rodents from their owners‚Äô homes and farms, and this is a job they still relish to conduct. They are often said to be the embodiment of a ‚Äúbig dog in a small body‚Äù, with confidence and fearlessness that in the past also allowed them to chase foxes from their dens to allow pursuit by huntsmen. The breed was only recognised as distinct from the Norfolk Terrier in 1964, and the breed standards for the two remain very similar, with the major difference between them being the carriage of the ears: the Norwich has prick ears while the Norfolk‚Äôs ears are dropped.
Norwich Terriers are extremely energetic, and even with regular walking will busy themselves patrolling every inch of the home for vermin for many hours of the day. Their affectionate and loving nature means they thrive on company, and should not be separated from their owners for long periods. Ever alert, they make excellent watch dogs, but lack aggression, and will quickly warm to a stranger once a kind word or open hand is offered. The breed shares some of the medical problems seen in the Norfolk Terrier, but most individuals are extremely healthy, and enjoy an average life expectancy of 13‚Äì15 years.
As its name implies, the breed was first developed around Norwich, in Norfolk, in the late nineteenth century, in response to a demand for a small, hardy breed, suited to living outdoors, that could hunt rodents in farm buildings. Although it is not clearly documented, it is believed that various terrier breeds such as the Irish Terrier, Border Terrier, and Cairn Terrier were cross-bred with ‚Äúratting‚Äù dogs kept by the local Gypsy communities to create the forerunners to the modern Norwich Terrier.
It was later adopted as a Cambridge University mascot in recognition of its popularity with the students, who appreciated the breed‚Äôs strong personality, as well as the services it rendered in controlling the rats and mice in their lodgings. At this point, it was known as the Trumpington Terrier, after Trumpington Street, where many of these students lived. ‚ÄúPodge‚Äù Lowe, the son of a local veterinary surgeon, and Frank Jones were two influential breeders at the time, with Frank Jones being responsible for their exportation to the United States, where they were initially known as ‚ÄúJones Terriers‚Äù. When pressed at a later date, it was Jones himself who coined the name Norwich Terrier.
Though the breed had long produced both drop and prick ear individuals, it was decided in the 1940s to begin developing these two varieties separately, with the drop-eared variety being designated the Norfolk Terrier in 1964.
This is a sturdy little dog with an eager demeanour. In recognition of its true terrier nature, the Kennel Club permits ‚Äúhonour scars‚Äù from normal wear and tear in show dogs. The Norwich Terrier is short and compact, with good bone structure. It has a broad, rounded skull and a well-defined stop leading to a wedge-shaped muzzle that is slightly shorter than the crown. It has small, dark, expressive eyes that are oval in outline, and medium-sized upright ears set high and wide apart on the head. It has tight lips and strong jaws with large teeth.
The Norwich has a relatively long neck and short back, and is broad across its level topline. The ribs are well sprung, and the ribcage is long in relation to the back. Both fore and hind limbs are muscular and short, leading to small, round, cat-like paws. The tail is set high, and is very thick at the base, tapering along straight lines.
The straight coat is extremely wiry, with a dense, weatherproof undercoat. It is longer around the neck, forming a collar or ‚Äúruff‚Äù that frames the dog‚Äôs face. Colours permitted by the Kennel Club are:
The breed standard specifies an ideal height of 25 cm (10 in), and does not allow for gender differences. Females tend to be more slightly built, usually weighing about 5 kg (11lb), while males average around 5.5‚Äì6 kg (12-13 lb).
The Norwich Terrier is a spirited and lively dog that is always ready to embrace new people and experiences. It is very devoted to its owner and eager to please, although this is not always compatible with its strong will and urge to explore. It is utterly fearless and very sociable, and although it is not the sort of dog to start a fight, it may be the one to finish it, with a tenacity and vigour that few can match. No two are alike, as they have strong individual personalities and mannerisms, and they are generally very good with children, willing to tolerate almost any assault by a toddler without complaint.
They have a very strong instinct to hunt, and cannot resist the urge to dig in search of prey, which may put them at odds with any keen gardeners in the family. However, adequate exercise can help reduce, if not eliminate, this behaviour. The breed is a good choice for families with other dogs, as most integrate peacefully into pack life, and they enjoy canine companionship almost as much as human. The Norwich Terrier is alert and watchful, and will alert its owners whenever visitors are near, but they rarely bark without reason.
Though this is an intelligent breed, many Norwich Terriers cheerfully resist training efforts. This is even apparent in puppyhood, when they can be slow to house break. Crate training can help any puppy to master the art of crossing their legs until given the opportunity to go outside, and may be particularly useful for Norwich puppies. This requires purchasing a good-sized indoor kennel or cage in which the pup can be left at night.
Reluctant to soil their bedding, most pups will quickly learn to manage their toileting until they are let out in the morning. When attempting obedience training, it is vital to provide some motivation, so plenty of verbal praise, and rewards in the form of treats, are essential for success.
While most Norwich Terriers live long and healthy lives, like all pedigrees, the breed is prone to a number of significant health complaints.
This condition is seen in many small-breed dogs, and is a common cause of a harsh, goose-honk cough often brought on by excitement or exercise. The problem originates from the dorsal membrane of the trachea ‚Äì a soft tissue structure responsible for maintaining the airway‚Äôs patency.
In dogs suffering from tracheal collapse, this membrane protrudes into the airway and, when the respiratory rate and/or effort increases, can obstruct breathing. This can range from a minor to severe problem. Weight loss can result in a massive improvement in obese dogs, but for those continuing to suffer there is now also a surgical implant available (at significant cost) that can alleviate the cough.
This can take one of two forms: grand mal and petit mal, with grand mal epilepsy having the more dramatic signs of convulsive muscular activity, loss of consciousness, and loss of bowel and bladder control. These epileptic episodes may be followed by periods of sedation or altered behaviour.
In petit mal epilepsy, the signs can be much more subtle, and indeed it is likely that many dogs with the condition are never diagnosed, as symptoms can range from periods of unusual behaviour to muscle spasms to uncontrolled salivation. For both forms, the need for treatment will be determined by the frequency and severity of the attacks ‚Äì many epileptics are symptomatic only once or twice a year.
Like the Norfolk Terrier, the Norwich is at relatively high risk of both congenital and acquired heart disease. The valve separating the left atrium and ventricle, known as the mitral valve, is the structure that is usually involved. In health, it prevents the backflow of blood during contraction of the heart, forcing unidirectional flow.
When degenerate or malformed, leaks through the valve increase pressure within the weak-walled atrium and result in heart enlargement, impaired function, and eventually, fluid seepage into the lungs or abdomen. Signs of the ensuing congestive heart failure include exercise intolerance, coughing, and abdominal enlargement. While heart disease is never viewed as a good thing, modern treatment regimens allow most affected dogs to enjoy a very good quality of life for several years.
Increased pressure within the eye, due to an imbalance between fluid production and drainage, is common in both the Norfolk and Norwich Terriers. This is suspected to be an inherited disorder, and may be due to malformation of the drainage apparatus located within the pigmented iris.
Signs may appear from middle age as enlargement of the eye, which may take on a red or blue hue, pain (sometimes manifesting as a change in personality), and loss of vision. Though medical treatments may alleviate the discomfort associated with glaucoma, it is rarely possible to restore vision, and removal of the affected eye is often the most humane option.
The eye‚Äôs lens, visible as the dark pupil, is a clear structure responsible for focusing light onto the nerve cells of the retina. It is held in position by a network of fibres that allow it to be stretched to a greater or lesser degree in response to changing light levels and focal distance. In many terrier breeds, these fibres weaken with age, with the result that the lens can dislocate from its normal position after minor trauma.
Depending on where the lens ends up, this causes varying degrees of pain, vision loss, and increased pressure within the eye. A range of treatment options are available, including removal of the lens, but the level of skill of the attending veterinary surgeon, as well as the owner‚Äôs financial situation, will determine the most appropriate course of action.
Despite the energetic nature of the breed, Norwich Terriers do not need a huge amount of exercise. Their short stature means that a brisk 30-minute walk on a daily basis should suffice to keep them fit and happy. On top of this, they are lively and visible companions within the home, always quick to answer the door or alert their owners to the presence of the neighbour‚Äôs cat in the garden, and are rarely to be found quietly curled up on the furniture.
The breed‚Äôs wiry coat requires little effort to maintain. Though many owners like to have it clipped occasionally for the sake of appearance, weekly brushing or combing is actually all that is needed to keep it in top condition. Because the Norwich Terrier is a digger, it may occasionally need bathing, but this should not be done more than monthly, as the hair can become dry and brittle with excessive washing.
Other routine grooming tasks include nail clipping as needed (when the nails can be heard to click on hard surfaces) and daily tooth brushing, which will prevent dental problems including tooth loss in later life.
The Who‚Äôs Who? list for the Norwich Terrier makes for quite light reading, as the breed prefers to be found down rabbit holes than on stage or in the press.

The Norwich Terrier, one of the smallest of the terriers, is bright, alert and cheerful with sharply pricked ears and a hard, wiry, weather proof coat. Their faces are described as fox-like, and despite their small size they are a compact and tenacious little dog.
The Norwich Terrier breed can be prone to:
- Patellar luxation¬†
- Upper airway syndrome¬π which is a problem caused by poor conformation that affects breathing.

Lively, friendly, active, intelligent, tenacious‚Ä¶ despite their small size, the Norwich Terrier is all terrier, and requires plenty of entertainment and activity. In common with other terriers, the Norwich is often thought of as wilful and stubborn, but this is due to their independent nature and quick mind. You have to work hard to get a terrier on-side and working with you, but when you do it is worth the effort.
Early socialisation and training is necessary with cats, small furry pets and livestock, as their original working instinct is a part of the Norwich‚Äôs terrier nature.
The Norwich Terrier‚Äôs origins can be found closely linked to Cambridge University where, in the late 1800s, it became fashionable for some of the undergraduates to own a particular type of terrier that was being bred in a livery stable in Trumpington Street which ran along the back of several of the colleges. These small working terriers were put to work as college ratters, and as the students lived and socialised together, their dogs had to be equally social, and indeed they would often work in a pack. It was one of these dogs, a sandy coloured one called Rags, that is credited with being the founding father of both the Norwich and Norfolk Terriers that we know today.
Until 1964, the drop eared dogs were still classified as Norwich Terriers but after this date, the two were kept separate with the prick-eared dogs retaining the original name.
If you have lots of energy, the patience to train and engage with your dog and the quiet calm to balance out the spark and fire of this tiny terrier, you are an ideal Norwich Terrier owner! ¬†Diddy they may be, but no one has informed the Norwich that they are one of the smallest terriers, so train as if they‚Äôre three times the size. Grooming and exercise are relatively easy but lots of work is needed in habituating and socialising to other dogs, children and other animals in general.
The Norwich Terrier requires an hour or more exercise each day, but will happily take more if you are offering it. Ensure a variety of activities, training, games, digging and chasing toys to keep your Norwich Terrier engaged and avoid boredom.
Being small, the Norwich Terrier can live in any sized home, however a secure garden with solid fencing is important as they are agile and more than capable of digging under fencing or squeezing through the smallest of gaps. Alert and vocal, the Norwich Terrier may find city living overwhelming, but suburban, semi-rural and countryside living with access to plenty of walks and secure spaces to run and chase will be ideal.
Small dogs have a fast metabolism, meaning they burn energy at a high rate, although their small stomachs mean that they must eat little and often. Small-breed foods are specifically designed with appropriate levels of key nutrients and smaller kibble sizes to suit smaller mouths. This also encourages chewing and improves digestion.
The hard, wire coat is relatively easy to keep in good condition with a good brush through once or twice a week. The coat will also need to be hand plucked twice a year. A professional groomer or the breeder will be able to give advice on this, and it is easy enough to learn to do yourself at home. A regularly hand stripped or rolled coat is extremely easy to maintain and is weatherproof and sheds dirt easily.
Early socialisation and habituation with children, cats, small furry pets and livestock is vital. The Norwich is a clever little dog and will learn quickly with positive reinforcement-based methods and a good understanding of what makes a terrier tick. Appropriate outlets for chasing, tugging, digging and chewing will meet your Norwich‚Äôs needs and keep them happy. Recall training is a must as the Norwich will be keen to chase anything they consider ‚Äòprey‚Äô. This is a fun little dog who will enjoy trick training and is capable of mini agility, scent work and more.
Better suited to homes with older children, and quieter homes. The Norwich Terrier is sharp and alert, meaning that the busy home may be over-stimulating, resulting in a stressed and likely noisy dog who cannot settle. Older teenagers who can help with training will enjoy working with this fun little dog.
While many dogs are traditionally thought of as being good with children, all dogs and children need to be taught to get on with and respect each other, and be safe together. Even so, dogs and young children should never be left alone together and adults should supervise all interactions between them.

Do Norwich Terrier dogs need a lot of exercises?
If you notice any weight gain, consult your veterinarian and make a diet plan. Reduce unhealthy food and snacks, and measure the Norwich Terrier weight regularly.
Brushing the dog's coat is useful to reduce shedding. Ears and eyes should be cleaned regularly to avoid infections.
Don't skip the seasonal flea treatment too. Dog nail trimming and dog bath can be helpful sometimes.
Check the local pet store for dog grooming supplies and find the best dog shampoo to keep its coat healthy and give your dog a pleasant experience of a dog bath.
If you don't have the time, skill, or money to take care of your Norwich Terrier, search for a dog groomer or clipping service in your area and book an appointment.
Maybe you're lucky to have a dog boarding service that includes grooming or walk-in dog bath places nearby.
If you notice any change in your dog's drooling habit, you should contact a vet as soon as possible.

During this time the females start to attract males. You can notice by swelling vulva and bloody discharge.
The second part is the Estrus when the female is receptive for the male. It lasts for about 3 to 11 days.
The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color.
The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the female‚Äôs discharge changes for vivid red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating.
The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts about six months.

The Norwich Terrier is one of the many terriers bred to control Britain‚Äôs rodent population. The breed is the quintessential terrier. Considered to be fearless and more sociable than the usual independent-minded terriers, so hunters are started to use Norwich in packs on foxhunts.
The breed was considered to be a ‚Äúwell-kept secret‚Äù over decades when they were simply used as vermin hunters in East England.
One Norwich named Rags came into possession of a stable owner in the town of Norwich. According to records from the early 1850s, Rags was bred and sired multiple litters of portentous and superb quality. He is considered today, the grandfather of all Norwich Terriers.
Being originated from the United Kingdom, the breed quickly became a state icon and was associated with the University of Cambridge in the 1870s and 1880s. Norwich ownership had become fashionable among the students. The breed was known as Trumpington Terrier in urban slang, for the reason that the majority of students acquired the dogs as pets from a livery stable on a street nearby named Trumpington.
The American history of the breed began in 1914 when Frank ‚ÄúRoughrider‚Äù Jones bred a dog named Willum descended from Rags. He exported Willum to Philadelphia, where the breed quickly found its fanciers, thanks to the cheerful behavior and the cute prick-eared puppies. Although the Norwich‚Äôs cuteness was indubitable, the breed gained more interested parties among horse lovers and fox hunters, because of their high-energy level and inquisitive nature. The Norwich Terrier in the United States was known as the Jones Terrier.
The AKC (American Kennel Club) recognized the breeds officially in 1932. However, because of many exterior and behavioral similarities, the breeds Norwich and Norfolk Terrier were considered to be the same, until 1979 when they were recognized as separate.
Speaking of today‚Äôs representation of the breed, Norwich has one of the highest pop-culture profiles, because of a dog named Winky played by a real-life show champion, from the movie ‚ÄúBest in Show‚Äù which is based on a true story. After Winky's owner injured herself, she forced her husband, who had the strange condition of having two left feet, to show the dog in the competition. In spite of his complete inexperience in the ring, he led Winky to victory. The movie is a parody of the intense and complex emotions and interactions experienced by show dog owners, their families, breeders, and handlers.

The Norwich Terrier is a short, sturdy, strong, little dog. The head is slightly rounded and wide, with a good amount of space between the ears. The wedge-shaped muzzle is strong, with a well-defined stop. The small, oval shaped eyes are dark in color. The medium sized ears stand erect. The legs are straight and the feet are round with black toenails. The medium sized tail is set high, level with the topline and is usually docked by half. Note: it is illegal to dock tails in most of Europe. The wiry, straight coat is about one and a half to two inches long. Coat colors include red, wheaten, tan, black and tan, or grizzle with or without dark points and occasionally with white markings.
Among the smallest of the working terriers, Norwich Terriers are active, courageous, affectionate, balanced and without any nervousness or quarrelsomeness. They are easy to train and need consistent rules to follow. These little dogs love everyone and are good with children. Because of their ratting instincts they tend to love anything you toss for them to chase after, such as toys, balls, sticks or bones. If left outside for a long period of time with nothing to do, without providing long pack walk to drain their energy, they can become barkers and diggers. This breed is generally good with other pets such as cats and dogs, but should not be trusted with small animals such as hamsters, pet rats, mice or guinea pigs. Do not allow this little dog to develop Small Dog Syndrome, where the dog believes he is pack leader to humans. This can cause many varying degrees of behavior problems including, but not limited to, separation anxiety, jealousy and guarding behaviors.They can be difficult to housebreak.
Height: 10 inches (25 cm.)
    Weight: 10 - 12 pounds (4.5 - 5.5 kg)
    These are the smallest of the terriers.
Some lines are prone to back problems and genetic eye diseases, but are generally healthy.
The Norwich Terrier will do okay in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. They are fairly active indoors and will do okay without a yard.
About 12-16 years
About 1 to 3 puppies
The shaggy, medium-length, waterproof coat is relatively easy to care for, but daily combing and brushing is important. Little clipping is required. Take extra care when the dog is shedding.  Bathe and dry shampoo only when necessary. This breed is a light shedder.
Developed in East Anglia, England, the Norfolk and Norwich Terriers used to be the same breed with two different ear types; both were referred to as the Norwich Terrier. The English were the first to separate them in 1964. In 1979 the AKC officially deemed them as separate breeds, the Norwich having small perked ears and the Norfolk with dropped ears. Another slight difference is the Norfolks are angular in shape and the Norwich Terriers are more round. The dogs were used as barnyard ratters and to bolt foxes that had gone to ground during a fox hunt. Their small size allowed them to get in and out of fox dens easily. After the foxes were flushed from their dens hunters on horseback would resume the chase with their hounds.
