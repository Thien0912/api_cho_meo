Regardless of the misconception, a great deal of pet dogs and cats can cohabit in harmony. Follow these simple to follow steps to get to know how to best introduce your Alaskan Malamute with a cat.


Not all Alaskan Malamutes detest cats, some get along with them. When Alaskan Malamutes do hate cats, of the most common factor is quite simple. Like all canines, Alaskan Malamutes still hold onto a few of the hunting tendencies that they were initially reproduced for. This is why Alaskan Malamutes like chasing all moving objects, whether it’s a toy, rodent, or a cat.
Considering that the majority of felines will escape when they encounter, it’s easy to see why they are understood for not being friendly with each other. Alaskan Malamutes actually take pleasure in chasing after felines not because they hate them, however generally because a quick running animal sets off a powerful, natural instinct to chase after overcomes any training or socialisation.


Educating your Alaskan Malamute to stop chasing cats requires time, training and consistency, but the reward of not needing to worry about them continuously chasing after is very well worth it. Here are the points of how to stop your Alaskan Malamute from going after felines.


The very best approach to ensure your Alaskan Malamute would never ever kill a cat is to raise them with cats when they’re a young puppy prior to 3 months old. At this age, they will normally wish to have fun with the felines and will not see them as prey.
If your Alaskan Malamute has actually killed a feline previously, its optimal if you keep them in an open, fenced off area. When taking them for strolls try to stop going after dusk and prior to dawn since that’s when felines are most active and likely to be roaming the streets.

As an animal lover, you know that sometimes having one pet just isn’t enough. However, it’s not always ideal to bring another pet into the home—especially if the one you currently have may not get along well with newcomers. If you’re debating introducing an Alaskan Malamute with your resident kitty (or vice versa), you’ve come to the right place.
Can Alaskan Malamutes and cats coexist? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t a simple “yes” or “no.” Malamutes can have very high prey drives, making them naturally inclined to chase and kill smaller animals. But that does not mean these two animals can’t successfully integrate. Alaskan Malamutes can be good with cats, but you’ll have to introduce them carefully and supervise their interactions.

You should understand all you can about the Malamute’s prey drive before learning more about their suitability for living with cats.
Alaskan Malamutes are a native Alaskan Arctic dog breed closely related to the Russian Samoyed and the Siberian Husky. They’re working dogs, traditionally used to help pull heavy sleds. However, they were also renowned for their superb hunting abilities and were often used to hunt large predators like bears.
This strong hunting background gives modern Malamutes their high prey drive. While your pup probably won’t be hunting bears in their spare time, their prey drive will still be active. They’ll be likely to chase smaller animals, like rabbits or squirrels and, yes, cats. This is why seasoned Malamute owners know to keep their pups on leashes when they’re out for walks unless they’re in a completely closed-in and safe dog park.
As we mentioned in our introduction, there isn’t a concrete “yes” or “no” answer to this question. Some Alaskan Malamutes can get along with cats, but that doesn’t mean all will. The compatibility of a Malamute and a cat will depend a lot on both animal’s personalities and the situation in which the animals are being introduced.
With early socialization and training, some Alaskan Malamutes can learn to live harmoniously with cats. Most success stories involved the dog being introduced to the kitty when they were still a puppy, and their prey drive hadn’t yet fully developed.
But that’s not to say that your adult Malamute can’t be introduced to a cat later in life and not be able to coexist successfully. It really just comes down to the personality of your individual dog. Some are easier going and more receptive to the training you’ll need to take them through to live alongside a cat, while others can’t get those prey-drive instincts under control long enough to share close quarters with smaller animals.

Dogs and cats can live harmoniously, provided the circumstances of their cohabitation are ideal. Here are some tips on how to introduce a cat and an Alaskan Malamute.
Teach your dog basic commands.
Your Malamute should be able to comprehend basic commands such as “sit”, “stay”, and “down” before meeting your cat.
Set up safe zones.
Your two animals should have their very own area in your home, which the other animal cannot access. Keep them separated, at least until the newcomer feels comfortable in their space.
Begin scent swapping.
Now that the new pet is comfortable in your home, it’s time to introduce both animals to one another’s scent. Cats and dogs use their strong sense of smell to make sense of their world, so this is a step you do not want to skip.
Scent swapping can be done in several ways. One option is to take a blanket or toy from each pet’s safe space and put it into the other animal’s room. Another involves allowing the two animals to have encounters from behind closed doors. Take your kitty to the room where your Malamute is being kept and let them smell one another with the door as a barrier between them.
Allow them to see each other.
Once the two animals are comfortable with one another’s scent, you can allow them to see each other. You must take things slowly here and keep each encounter very brief. Pay close attention to the body language of your pets to determine if the meetings need to be cut shorter.
Let them interact.
Once your pets can handle the scent and sight of one another, you can allow them to interact. Keep your Malamute on a leash. Do not force these encounters. Your cat should have an escape route they can take if they’re feeling uncomfortable.
Supervise them.
It should go without saying, but your kitty and Malamute should be kept separate whenever you are not around to supervise them. Even the best-behaved dogs can be taken over by their prey drive, and that’s not a sight you want to come home to.
Be patient.
Never rush through this introductory period, and don’t set an unrealistic timeline for this transitionary period. Listen to your pets and let them guide you. Give them plenty of time to adjust to each other’s presence.
Provide a cat-friendly environment.
Your cat needs places in your home to climb, hide, and escape if they feel threatened by your Malamute. Provide plenty of cat-safe spaces that your dog cannot access, such as cat trees, wall shelves, or completely dog-free zones.

Alaskan Malamutes and cats may be able to get along, but this isn’t always the case. It depends entirely on the personality of your pets and the circumstances in which they are introduced. You may have better luck living harmoniously with a kitty and a Malamute if they’re introduced at a young age and the transitionary period is slow, controlled, and deliberate.

While Alaskan Malamutes are generally friendly and gentle with people, their prey drive can make them a potential danger to cats and other small animals. As natural hunters, they may see cats as prey and chase them, even if they are raised together from a young age. Therefore, it is important to introduce an Alaskan Malamute to a cat slowly and carefully, and to always supervise their interactions to ensure the safety of both animals.
Alaskan Malamutes are a breed of dog known for their friendly and affectionate nature. They are generally loyal and devoted to their owners, and can make excellent family pets. However, it is important to note that they have certain instincts and behaviors that can make them challenging to live with in certain situations.
One of the most important things to consider when thinking about whether an Alaskan Malamute is a good fit for a household with cats is their prey drive. Alaskan Malamutes are a breed of dog that has been developed for hunting and pulling sleds. As a result, they have a strong instinct to chase and capture prey.
This can be a problem if you have cats in your home. Even if your Alaskan Malamute is well-trained and socialized, they may still be tempted to chase or attack your cats. It is important to supervise any interactions between your Alaskan Malamute and your cats, and to take steps to prevent any aggressive behavior.
Socialization and training are key factors in determining whether an Alaskan Malamute will be good with cats. Alaskan Malamutes are generally friendly and sociable dogs, but they can become aggressive if they are not properly socialized and trained.
It is important to expose your Alaskan Malamute to a variety of people, animals, and environments from a young age. This will help them develop good social skills and reduce their likelihood of becoming aggressive towards cats or other animals.
Training is also important for ensuring that your Alaskan Malamute behaves appropriately around cats. You should teach your Alaskan Malamute basic obedience commands such as "sit," "stay," and "come," and reinforce these commands regularly. You should also use positive reinforcement techniques such as treats and praise to encourage good behavior.
Overall, Alaskan Malamutes can be good with cats if they are properly socialized and trained. However, their prey drive and hunting instincts can make them a challenging breed to live with in certain situations. If you are considering getting an Alaskan Malamute and you have cats, it is important to carefully consider whether this breed is a good fit for your household.
Introducing an Alaskan Malamute to a cat requires careful supervision and patience. It is essential to introduce them gradually and in a controlled environment to avoid any aggressive behavior towards the cat. The best way to introduce them is by keeping the Alaskan Malamute on a leash and allowing the cat to approach them at their own pace.
It is important to note that Alaskan Malamutes are a strong and dominant breed, and they may perceive a cat as prey. Therefore, it is crucial to observe their behavior during the introduction and intervene if necessary.
Understanding the body language of an Alaskan Malamute is crucial when introducing them to a cat. An Alaskan Malamute's body language can indicate their mood and intentions towards the cat.
When an Alaskan Malamute is relaxed, they will have their ears up, tail wagging, and their body will be loose. However, if they become agitated, their ears may go back, and their tail may be held high and stiff. This is a sign that they are feeling threatened and may become aggressive towards the cat.
In conclusion, Alaskan Malamutes can be good with cats, but it requires careful supervision and patience during the introduction process. It is essential to understand their body language and intervene if necessary to ensure a peaceful coexistence between the two animals.
Introducing an Alaskan Malamute to a cat requires patience and careful supervision. It is recommended to start with a controlled introduction in a neutral location, such as a park or a backyard. The Malamute should be on a leash and the cat should be in a carrier or on a leash as well. Allow them to sniff each other from a safe distance and reward positive behavior with treats. Repeat this process several times until they are comfortable with each other's presence.
It is important to provide separate spaces for the cat and the Malamute to retreat to when needed. This can be achieved by using baby gates or by designating specific areas in the house for each pet. The cat should have access to high places, such as shelves or a cat tree, where it can observe the Malamute from a safe distance. Additionally, the Malamute should have its own bed and toys to prevent it from playing with the cat's belongings.
Engaging in shared activities can help build a positive relationship between the cat and the Malamute. For example, feeding them at the same time in separate areas can create a positive association with each other's presence. Playing with toys together under supervision can also help build trust and respect between the two pets.
Overall, creating a harmonious environment for an Alaskan Malamute and a cat requires patience, supervision, and careful planning. By following proper introduction techniques, maintaining separate spaces, and engaging in shared activities, it is possible to foster a positive relationship between the two pets.
When considering adding an Alaskan Malamute to a household with cats, there are a few important factors to keep in mind. Both the personality traits of the Alaskan Malamute and the cat's personality and breed should be considered before introducing them to each other.
Alaskan Malamutes are known for their strong prey drive, which can make them a potential threat to cats. They were originally bred for sledding and hunting, and as a result, they have a natural instinct to chase and hunt small animals. This trait can make it difficult for them to coexist peacefully with cats.
However, with proper training and socialization, Alaskan Malamutes can learn to live with cats. It is important to start the training early and to supervise all interactions between the two animals until you are confident that they can coexist peacefully.
The personality and breed of the cat should also be taken into consideration. Some cats are more social and outgoing than others, which can make it easier for them to get along with an Alaskan Malamute. Additionally, some cat breeds are more dog-like in nature and may be more accepting of a new canine companion.
It is important to introduce the two animals slowly and gradually, allowing them to get used to each other's presence before allowing them to interact. Providing a safe space for the cat to retreat to, such as a high perch or a separate room, can also help to ease the transition.
In conclusion, while Alaskan Malamutes can be a potential threat to cats due to their strong prey drive, with proper training, socialization, and consideration of the cat's personality and breed, they can learn to coexist peacefully in a multi-pet household.
While Alaskan Malamutes can be trained to coexist with cats, their size and play style can pose a potential challenge. Alaskan Malamutes are large dogs, weighing between 75 and 100 pounds, while cats are typically much smaller. This size difference can make it difficult for the dog to understand how to play gently with the cat, and can lead to accidental injury.
Additionally, Alaskan Malamutes have a high prey drive and may view cats as prey. This means that it is important to supervise interactions between the two animals closely and to teach the dog appropriate behavior around cats.
It is important to monitor the behaviors of both the Alaskan Malamute and the cat when they are together. Signs of aggression or fear should be addressed immediately to prevent any potential harm to either animal.
One way to monitor their behavior is to keep them separated when unsupervised. This can be achieved by using baby gates or crates to separate the two animals when necessary.
It is also important to provide both animals with their own space and resources, such as separate food and water bowls, beds, and toys. This can help prevent any potential resource guarding or territorial behavior.
Overall, while Alaskan Malamutes can coexist with cats, it is important to be aware of the potential challenges that may arise and to take steps to prevent any harm to either animal. With proper training and supervision, it is possible for these two animals to live together peacefully.
Alaskan Malamutes can coexist peacefully with cats if they are introduced to each other properly and trained to behave appropriately around each other. However, it is important to keep in mind that every dog is different, and some may have a higher prey drive than others.
Alaskan Malamutes have a high prey drive, which means they have a natural instinct to chase and hunt small animals. This can make them dangerous to cats if they are not trained properly. It is important to supervise any interactions between an Alaskan Malamute and a cat, especially during the initial introduction phase.
The best way to introduce an Alaskan Malamute to a household with cats is to do so gradually. Start by keeping the dog and cat separated by a baby gate or closed door, allowing them to see and smell each other. Slowly increase their interactions while closely supervising them. Reward positive behavior from both animals.
Alaskan Malamutes can be trained to live in a multi-pet household, including cats. However, it is important to keep in mind that every dog is different and some may have a higher prey drive than others. It is important to supervise any interactions between an Alaskan Malamute and a cat, especially during the initial introduction phase.
Proper socialization is important for all dogs, including Alaskan Malamutes. Socializing them with smaller animals, such as cats, from a young age can help them learn appropriate behavior around them. However, it is important to supervise any interactions between an Alaskan Malamute and a cat, especially during the initial introduction phase.
Both Alaskan Malamutes and Huskies have a high prey drive, but Alaskan Malamutes tend to be less aggressive towards cats than Huskies. However, every dog is different, and it is important to supervise any interactions between dogs and cats, regardless of breed. Proper training and socialization are key factors in ensuring a peaceful coexistence between Alaskan Malamutes and cats.

Learn more about this breed that originates from the most northern part of the US

Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years
Size: 25-inches, average (male); 23 inches, average (female)
Coat: Thick double coat
Temperament: Friendly, playful, intelligent, loyal, devoted, dignified, affectionate
Exercise needs: Minimum of two hours daily
Origin/native country: Alaska, US
Alaskan Malamutes are large dogs that have been bred for thousands of years, making them one of the oldest dog breeds in the world. Prized for being strong and more than capable of working for hours on end, they’re very happy pulling sleds and carting heavy gear in extremely cold temperatures, making them one of the best dog breeds for cold climates. They can also ably assist humans on challenging expeditions and their love of the great outdoors is well known.
One of the many facts about Alaskan Malamutes is that they were originally bred as working sled dogs and they have extremely high energy levels. As such, they are very active dogs and they need plenty of exercise – you will need an abundance of time (more than two hours a day) and a lot of motivation to get out and about if you intend to care for this high-energy dog breed.
As such, a stroll around the block is unlikely to be sufficient and you can’t rely on simply letting this breed out in the yard either.
“Alaskan Malamutes are bred for strenuous exercise in adverse conditions,” says vet Dr Rebecca MacMillan. “Exercise is therefore extremely important to keep them in good condition, both physically and mentally.”
To that end, you’ll need to embark on long walks and allow this breed to run in sizeable, secure areas. It’s also a good idea to offer Alaskan Malmutes some working activities such as sledding, backpacking and weight-pulling. Challenging obstacle courses work well too and you should bear in mind that this breed loves swimming so try to identify a safe stretch of water for them to play in.
Alaskan Malamutes have been involved in some horrific – sometimes fatal – biting incidents, but the actual numbers are low and attacks are very rare. By and large, Alaskan Malamutes are friendly towards people and loyal to their human families although they may exhibit aggression towards other dogs.

As with all dog breeds, however, their behavior will be shaped, to a large extent, by their training.
“Alaskan Malamutes are not an aggressive breed when appropriately trained and socialized,” says Dr MacMillan. “They will need plenty of physical and mental stimulation to keep behavioral issues at bay.”
Still, it’s worth bearing in mind that Alaskan Malamutes have a bite force of between 400 and 500 pounds per square inch, which puts them at the higher end.
According to the book “The Intelligence of Dogs” by canine psychology expert Stanley Coren, Alaskan Malamutes have average intelligence, which means it will take between 25 and 40 repetitions for the breed to understand new commands. This means training will require a great deal of positive reinforcement and a firm, confident approach.
“An Alaskan Malamute is definitely not a beginner’s dog or a breed for first-time dog owner,” says Dr MacMillan. “You will need plenty of time and patience to put into their training and they can be difficult due to their stubborn temperament.”
Sessions will need to be engaging and varied to prevent boredom. Consistency and clear boundaries are also a must. Eventually, however, Alaskan Malamutes will become obedient, well-behaved and less prone to destruction.

Again, this depends on their background. “They have the potential to make good family pets provided they receive enough exercise and positive attention,” says Dr MacMillan.
The key is to determine whether or not you can devote sufficient time to this breed while looking after a family.
You should also consider whether or not it’s desirable to introduce Alaskan Malamutes into a home with younger children – they are large, strong dogs capable of accidentally knocking over children and babies, potentially causing injuries.
In any case, you should never leave a young child alone with an Alaskan Malamute and it’s also a good idea to assess whether you have sufficient space in your house. One thing’s for sure, an Alaskan Malamute is not a large breed suitable for apartment living.
Alaskan Malamutes are a relatively high-maintenance breed. “They have a thick double coat that sheds all year round. They can also have a big ‘blowout’ twice a year when they shed even more heavily than usual,” says Dr MacMillan. “Regular grooming of the double coat will help remove dead fur, reducing the amount of loose dog hairs around your home. You should groom your Alaskan Malamute at least once a week to keep their coat in good order.”
In general, grooming will consist of a weekly brush although some breed experts have said daily brushing is also desirable, perhaps stepping up to twice-a-day when shedding is at its peak. You should also take this breed to a professional groomer two to four times a year. It’s also important to keep an Alaskan Malamute’s teeth in good shape by brushing at least three times each week and to ensure their nails are regularly trimmed.
As with most pedigree breeds, Alaskan Malamutes are prone to certain health conditions.
“Hip and elbow dysplasia is a condition that is seen commonly in this breed,” says Dr MacMillan. “Affected joints don’t develop properly as the puppy grows and matures, leading to painful lameness. Chondrodysplasia [a genetic disorder that causes abnormal bone and cartilage development] is also found in the Alaskan Malamute population and this causes dwarfism in some puppies.”
Hypothyroidism is frequently found in Alaskan Malamutes, too.
“This endocrine disorder results in a lack of thyroid hormone which controls metabolism. Affected dogs can be prone to weight gain, lethargy, and skin disorders.”
Alaskan Malamutes are also prone to inherited polyneuropathy – a neurological disorder causing progressive muscle weakness. But there are ways to ensure a healthier puppy.
“Choosing a puppy from fit parents that have been health screened, will help to reduce the risk of some of these conditions,” Dr MacMillan says.
If you are experienced with dogs, live in a sizable home with lots of outdoor space nearby, and don’t have a very young family, then an Alaskan Malamute will be a lovely choice of breed. But if you have little time to train and socialize a puppy and can’t devote the hours to exercise, steer clear. Similarly, if you have a young family, then it may be worth looking for a breed more suited to families.

The Alaskan Malamute is a large breed of domestic dog originally bred for their strength and endurance to haul heavy freight as a sled dog. They are similar to other arctic breeds, like the Greenland dog, Canadian Eskimo Dog, the Siberian Husky, and the Samoyed. They are believed to be one of the oldest breeds involved in this sport in the Arctic. The Alaskan Malamute was named after the native Inuit tribe called the Mahlemuts, who settled in Alaska. They have been used for centuries by these native people to pull sleds, hunt seals, and chase away polar bears. This breed was shaped by the difficult climate of the Arctic region, like many breeds in the spitz family.
Alaskan Malamutes can suffer from hip and elbow dysplasia, dwarfism, hypothyroidism, day blindness, von Willebrand's disease, and inherited polyneuropathy. They may also suffer from gastric torsion, hemeralopia, seizures, cataracts, and osteochondrodysplasia. Genetic testing for polyneuropathy, cone degeneration, and degenerative myelopathy can assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Alaskan Malamutes are known to be affectionate, loyal, and playful dogs. They are friendly and sociable, which can make them less suitable as guard dogs. They are excellent family dogs and can be very good with children. However, due to their original breeding purposes, they have a high energy level and require a substantial amount of exercise to keep them happy and healthy.While they are generally friendly, they can be aggressive or dominant towards other dogs of the same sex. They are intelligent dogs, but they have an independent streak, which can make training a challenge at times. Alaskan Malamutes have a strong prey drive due to their hunting origins, so they need to be supervised around small animals.They are known to be vocal and will often "talk" or howl, especially when bored or left alone for long periods. Alaskan Malamutes do not generally make good apartment dogs, as they are active and need space to run and play. Alaskan Malamutes have a waterproof double coat that helped them to adapt to the harsh Arctic climate. The coat needs consistent brushing every week. They shed twice a year and will need extra brushing during those times. The coat can harbor fungus which can become infected and should be checked regularly.
The Alaskan Malamute played a significant role during the Gold Rush in the late 1800s, and they served in World War II primarily as search and rescue dogs. Alaskan Malamutes are considered a foundational breed to the modern sled-dog sport.The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1935.
