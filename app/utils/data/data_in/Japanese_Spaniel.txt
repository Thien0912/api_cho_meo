The Japanese Chin, also sometimes known as the Japanese Spaniel, is a toy dog with an aristocratic history and many redeeming personality traits. These pups have an air of prestige and elegance about them and are known to make fantastic companions. As easygoing and affectionate as this breed is, they aren’t suitable for every household. Read on to learn more about Japanese Chins to determine how well one would fit into your lifestyle.

The Japanese Chin is a fantastic dog for first-time dog owners. They’re relatively easy to care for, as they don’t require a lot of exercise or grooming, and their small stature makes them easy to live and travel with. They can live happily in smaller dwellings like apartments or houses with or without a backyard. These easygoing and versatile pups are loving toward their family members, making them a great introduction to dog ownership.

Japanese Chins are relatively easy to find. At the time of writing, there are over 25 litters currently available for adoption on the American Kennel Club’s marketplace. Since this breed is prone to numerous genetic conditions, potential adopters must do their research before choosing a breeder. All reputable breeders should happily provide proof of genetic testing for their breeding pairs to reduce the likelihood of their puppies inheriting genetic mutations in their DNA.
Japanese Chin puppies are adorable and affectionate, but they require proper training and socialization from a young age to grow into well-balanced adults.
The exact origin of the Japanese Chin is a hotly debated topic. Some believe the breed was a product of China, while others think it originated in Korea. Still, it is generally accepted that the Chin was developed primarily by the Japanese nobility between 500 and 1,000 years ago. The first Chin was brought to England in the 1600s, but they weren’t introduced to the West until the mid-1800s when Japan was reopened for trade after hundreds of years of isolation.

Japanese Chins are one of the most cat-like dog breeds. They are intelligent and independent and even groom themselves like their feline counterparts. Some Chins enjoy resting on high perches and have a decent sense of balance. Of course, they’re much more fragile than cats, so care needs to be taken to prevent injury when allowing your Chin in high places. A poorly executed jump off the sofa can result in serious injuries.
Chins are highly affectionate toward their family members. They’re bright, happy, and charming dogs that enjoy a good play session as much as a snuggle on the couch. Though they were originally bred to be companions of royalty, they aren’t content with lazing on the couch all day. Chins need exercise to stay happy, healthy, and stimulated.
The Chin is typically standoffish with strangers, which is why it’s so important to provide enough socialization early on in puppyhood to prevent this behavior. Chins are generally a quiet breed, but they won’t be shy when alerting the arrival of visitors, making them quite useful as watchdogs. However, their small stature won’t do much to scare away a burglar or protect their family.
The size and temperament of Japanese Chins make them a great option for families. They generally do well with children, though all interactions should be supervised, especially when the kids are young. Chins are a toy breed, after all, and could be unintentionally injured during play. For this reason, potential owners should consider waiting until their kids are older to adopt a Chin.
Chins can develop separation anxiety, but this can be addressed through crate training and slowly introducing them to the idea of being left alone for short periods. However, because they’re very loyal companions, they generally don’t do well with being left alone for long periods.
Japanese Chins are generally easygoing when it comes to other household pets, so long as they’ve been properly trained and socialized as puppies. It’s important to remember, however, that Chins are a toy breed, so you may want to reconsider adopting one if you have an extra-large breed, as Chins are extremely fragile and can get hurt easily.

The Japanese Chin may be prone to obesity, so they need to be fed a high-quality diet in appropriate portions. The exact portions will vary from dog to dog, depending on their age and activity levels. A veterinarian can help owners determine exactly how much to feed to ensure adequate nutrition without the risk of overfeeding.
The best food will also vary from Chin to Chin. It’s important to ensure they’re eating high-quality food that meets the nutritional recommendations, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). It’s essential to feed a life-stage-appropriate diet, especially during the first year of life, as Chin puppies require higher calories to allow for proper growth during this time. Once they reach a year old, they won’t grow any further, so the diet should slowly transition to a maintenance food designed for small breeds.
As for feeding frequency, most Chin owners opt to feed their dogs three times daily to prevent hypoglycemia.
Though they may be small, the Japanese Chin is a fairly active little pup. They enjoy going for slow-paced walks with their owners and exploring their fenced-in backyards. Thirty minutes of physical activity daily is all this breed needs to stay happy and healthy.
Due to their flat-faced facial anatomy, Chins can be prone to overheating and heat stroke, so it’s best to avoid overexerting them during warmer weather.
The Japanese Chin is an intelligent dog breed, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy to train. These pups can have an air of superiority about them, which can make training a challenge. It’s easy to see how they’ve developed this attitude when you consider that Chins were bred specifically to act as companions for royalty. Their only job throughout their centuries-long existence has been to comfort and charm their humans. Some owners describe their Chins’ temperament during training as cat-like, so it’s important to remember that when training. Owners must always use positive reinforcement and have plenty of high-value rewards on hand. Chins will shut down at the first sign of harshness, so keep sessions short, fun, and engaging.
If you have problems training your Chin, it’s okay to need professional help. Experienced trainers can provide useful advice to help you get back on the right track.
Japanese Chins have long, silky coats that look high maintenance but are relatively easy to maintain. They need to be brushed once weekly and bathed monthly, but that’s all that’s required of Chin owners to keep their coats in tip-top shape. Special care should be given to the skirt and under the ears and legs.
Chins have single coats and don’t shed much. Additionally, they’re great at self-grooming.
The breed’s unique facial anatomy does require regular cleaning. The skin folds around the nose can trap moisture, which may lead to fungal problems. The face should be wiped with a damp cloth, and the folds cleaned with a dry cotton swab occasionally. Pet wipes are also great for spot cleaning.
Of course, nails will need trimming, probably more often than you think, as they grow quite fast. Ears and teeth should be checked and cleaned regularly to avoid ear infections and dental issues.
The Japanese Chin has a shorter average lifespan than other similarly sized toy dog breeds. Papillons, for example, are around the same size as the Chin, but their average life expectancy is between 13 to 15 years, compared to the Chin’s 10 to 12 years.
The Chin can be predisposed to numerous health issues.
Brachycephalic airway syndrome (BAS) is noted in flat-faced breeds and may cause snoring, snorting, gagging, coughing, and heavy breathing. BAS can make Chin’s highly sensitive to warmer temperatures and prone to overheating.
GM2 gangliosidosis is a fatal, inherited disease only found in the Japanese Chin. It is noted by loss of nervous system functioning, which causes incoordination, tremors, difficulty eating, and vision loss. This condition is entirely preventable if responsible breeders would test their breeding line.
Eye issues like cataracts, entropion (the inward rolling of the eyelid), and distichiasis (extra eyelash growth) are sometimes noted in this breed.
Some heart conditions, such as myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVP), can develop in some Chins.
There aren’t any notable differences between male and female Japanese Chins. Unlike most dog breeds with clear differences in height and weight between genders, both male and female Chins grow to be around the same size.

So similar, in fact, that the two dogs were, at one point, considered the same breed. However, Pekingese were further developed to have a double coat and longer fur around their neck and shoulders. Additionally, despite weighing a smidge more, Pekingese are slighter and shorter than their Chin counterparts.
Japanese Chins are so small because original breeders needed them to be tiny enough to be carried in the sleeves of a woman’s kimono. Some historians claim that Chins were occasionally kept in cages and fed sake to stunt their growth.
The Japanese Chin is an intelligent breed that can be taught to perform tricks if they have the right motivation (a.k.a. lots of tasty treats). One of their favorite tricks is the “Chin spin,” in which they spin around at high speeds, often on two legs.

The Japanese Chin is a decidedly cat-like dog breed with many redeeming characteristics. These lively and affectionate dogs form strong bonds with their humans and want nothing more than to feel like part of a family. However, we don’t recommend adopting one if you have small children, as the Chin’s toy breed stature makes them extremely fragile.
Chins are great for first-time dog owners, though training them can be a challenge. Potential owners should be open to calling in reinforcements (professional dog trainers) if they run into issues while training or socializing their pups.

Chantelle is passionate about two things in her life – writing and animals. She grew up on the prairies of 
Canada  surrounded by animals and as an adult, she choose to share her home with five cats, two guinea pigs, and a bearded dragon. Chantelle, her husband, and their child take great pride in  being great animal parents - the ones who spend a thousand dollars on wall-mounted cat shelves so that their cats can have an indoor jungle gym all year round. When Chantelle isn’t snuggling her cats on the couch or taking pictures of them being funny, she’s outside exploring in the Rocky Mountains, binging the same shows on Netflix over and over, and reading about whatever random topic pops into her brain.

                Japanese Spaniel, Chin
This peculiar little dog hails not from Japan, although the breed has certainly done well there, but from China. The word ‘chin’ signifies ‘cat-like,’ and indeed this lady is one of the cattiest of dogs. The Chin climbs like a cat (if she can’t quite match the cat’s agility) and is just as likely to snooze on the the back of your sofa as on the cushion ; she grooms herself with her paws, and can even be said to have a cat-like face, through which she snorts and sneezes in a disturbing but generally harmless manner.
Life expectancy
The Japanese Chin has a life expectancy of between 12 and 14 years
Temperament
Size
Adult size

White with black and/or red symmetrical markings.
The Japanese Chin's hair length is of medium length.
Its type of coat is silky and single coated.
Black.
Purchase price
The Japanese Chin costs between £570 and £735
She likes to entertain with tricks, such as the ‘Chin Spin’ or windmill, and dancing on her back legs.
The Chin can trace her lineage back over hundreds of years, to when Chinese traders travelled the Silk Road with little dogs whom they would sometimes leave behind or give to the Buddhist monasteries they passed. The monks bred the animals so that they evolved into a similar creature to that we see today; her figure can be spotted on ancient pottery, embroidery, and on temple walls. Travelling dignitaries would acquire the dogs when they passed through the monasteries, and made gifts of them to royal courts, where they would be treated like royalty themselves, their every whim catered to by eunuchs. She first found her way to Europe in the mid-19th century; Queen Victoria had a fine pair. Today she has become very popular in the east and west alike.
Group 9 - Companion and Toy Dogs
Section 8 : Japan Chin and Pekingese
The Chin is a good-natured and affectionate companion who will expect to be treated right but will repay you with love and attention.
She likes to play although, given her size and self-opinion, games should not be too boisterous.
She is a calm and docile little dog.
The Chin is moderately intelligent and, if she won’t read you the daily news, will at least sit patiently and appear to acknowledge you as you read the papers to her.
Although, like many royals, she may have a little hunter in her from her deep prehistory, this is not likely to raise its head today.
She can be a bit shy around newcomers.
She is quite an independent type and will not take well to excessive bossing-about.
This is not a dog who appreciates alone-time. She is a companion dog, which is to say she demands your companionship and is liable to sulk if deprived of your society.
If you’ve ever tried to train a cat, you can imagine what this little princess’s education is going to look like. While she’s bright enough to pick things up, her independent streak can make it tough to convey lessons to her. Patience and time are needed, and above all the pedagogue should be careful not to give in to suggestions that the dog, rather than the human, holds authority within the pack.
She does not bark often, and then mainly when she is uncomfortable in unfamiliar company or if she senses an intruder in the home. A poorly-trained Chin accustomed to being spoilt may also bark if she feels she is not getting the attention she deserves.
The princess is a dreamer, and left alone in a poorly-fenced garden is prone to wandering in pursuit of butterflies, birds, and the frogs she desperately hopes will prove to be royalty-in-disguise (or at the very least, delicious).
While this delicate creature does not have the physical power to create undue chaos, if left alone she may certainly signal her dissatisfaction through petulant acts of sabotage.
In general, the Chin is no glutton.
The Chin does not appreciate uninvited company, and will bark to raise the alarm should an intruder appear ; however, the pack’s response had better be quick, as she is by no means equipped to tackle the fiend.
If you’ve ever tried to train a cat, you can imagine what this little princess’s education is going to look like. While she’s bright enough to pick things up, her independent streak can make it tough to convey lessons to her. Patience and time are needed, and above all the pedagogue should be careful not to give in to suggestions that the dog, rather than the human, holds authority within the pack.
The Japanese Chin makes an ideal flat dog since she requires relatively little exercise and is easy to store. She is often considered to be a lap dog, and thus needs little more space than your portable computer.
She requires regular walks, but nothing too much, and will appreciate a garden if available, but the latter is hardly mandatory. Her anti-social side and tendency to wander make the freedom of a leash-less walk in the park less than ideal.
She fits in your handbag and likes to be kept close, so travel is generally not a problem.
She should tolerate the company of cats as long as she is raised alongside them. However, beware that cats may not tolerate her company – especially if she becomes centre of attention – and can easily damage the creature due to the ready accessibility of her bulging aristocratic eyeballs.
Again, if socialised well, she should not have a problem with other dogs ; however, caution should be heeded, especially around hunter-type dogs, who may see her as cat-like enough to be ‘fair game.’
Her delicate structure makes the Chin a little vulnerable around small or boisterous children. She may snap (break) or snap (nip) if handled with insufficient respect.
The Chin is a good choice for an older person. She’s lightweight, requires only moderate exercise, and is happy to provide company and affection.
With her small footprint, incapacity to create much damage, and her affectionate behaviour, she can make a good first dog ; however, dog ownership virgins should be wary not to give in to her demanding side or to spoil her with attention and treats before she is properly trained.
The average price for a Japanese Chin dog is between £570 - £735.
The Japanese Chin can cost around £25 - £40 per month to feed and maintain.
Average
Most of the time her fur does not cause as much litter as you might expect, but once or twice a year she will shed more severely, at which point you will be very grateful you bought that DustBuster that’s been under the stairs since the 1980s.
She may look grooming-intensive, but it doesn’t actually take too much work to keep the Chin looking and feeling handsome. Brush her once a week; bathe her once a month; and clip her nails regularly. More regular brushing or combing is to be encouraged if the owner has time, particularly to avoid tangles and to keep the feathered parts looking fresh and alluring. More regular baths, however, should only be taken if necessary, as they can dry out the princess’s delicate skin. Don’t forget that, in her catlike way, the Chin will attend to a certain level of personal hygiene herself. Special attentions should be paid to the ears and nose, which are prone to build up dirt, wax, and bacteria due to their foldy nature. This should be performed by the human, since dogs cannot generally operate cotton-buds.
12-14 years.
While no twiglet, the Chin was built for pleasure, not graft; she should not be put to work or left out overnight, and may snap in the hands of an anarchistic toddler.
Due to her brachycephalic face, the Chin will soon become uncomfortable in anything approaching hot weather. She should be kept somewhere cool, given plenty of fresh water, and fanned with a giant palm leaf if the temperature exceeds expectations, as indeed it frequently will as humankind begins the slow decline towards extinction along the path of climate change.
Extreme cold can also trouble this pug-nosed little princess, but not so much as the hot weather.
While the Chin herself does not tend towards gluttony, it’s all too easy to over-treat and under-exercise her, in which case weight-gain is the inevitable outcome.
Oh no...

The Japanese Chin, also known as the Japanese Spaniel, is an ancient toy breed originating from China. They were highly revered in Japan, where they were kept as cherished companions by aristocrats and royalty. The breed was introduced to Japan in the 7th century, and from there, they made their way to Europe in the 17th century, becoming popular among European nobility as well. The breed's presence in Europe also influenced the Chin name, as it was a misinterpretation of the word Chinese.
The Japanese Chin may suffer from atlantoaxial instability, cataracts, corneal abrasions, distichiasis, entropion, early-onset heart murmurs, GM-2 gangliosidosis, GM-2 gangliosidosis type I, hypothyroidism, Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease, lens luxation, mitral valve disease, patellar luxation, persistent hyaloid artery, persistent hyperplastic tunica vasculosa lentis, persistent pupillary membranes, progressive retinal atrophy (prcd), ulcerative keratitis, and vitreous degeneration. Patella and ophthalmologist evaluations are recommended for this breed along with GM2 mutation DNA tests and cardiac exams. The Japanese Chin is a brachycephalic breed, which makes them intolerant to heat. They also cannot tolerate anesthesia.
Japanese Chins are known for their charming and affectionate nature. They form strong bonds with their human families and enjoy being lap dogs, often seeking attention and companionship. Despite their small size, they can be quite confident and lively. However, they may be reserved around strangers. They are generally well-mannered and gentle, making them excellent companions for families and seniors alike.
The Japanese Chin is often depicted in traditional Japanese art, including paintings and porcelain figurines.Despite the name "Japanese Chin," the breed actually has Chinese origins.They have a distinct "cat-like" behavior, such as grooming themselves and using their paws to touch objects.In the past, they were considered sacred dogs in Japan, and some even had their own servants.The Japanese Chin has a luxurious, long, and silky coat that features a profuse mane of fur around their neck and chest. Their coat is straight and feathered, especially on their ears, legs, and tail.

The Japanese chin is a popular toy sized dog breed from Asia. Japanese chins likely have more cat like behaviors than any other dog breed as they can easily jump onto tall furniture and counters, desire being in tall places, bat objects with their paws, and even periodically bathe themselves.
Japanese chins do well in a variety of environments, but they are companion dogs and prefer being with their owner as often as possible. Their small size makes them an ideal pet for a small home, apartment, or condo. They are considered a happy dog breed, and get along well with just about everyone and other pets.
The Japanese Chin may be the perfect companion for those seeking an indoor lap dog. Members of this breed are very versatile-- old or young, apartment or palace-- the Chin will warm your feet and your heart. They are happy, charming and very aristocratic. Japanese Chins are suitable for apartments since they are considered quiet dogs and are cat-like in their cleanliness. A great family choice, they are loving and entertaining; the Chin Spin is one such behavior where they hop on their hind legs and spin around when eager or excited. The breed is friendly towards all- kids, strangers, and other pets. Consider the following Japanese Chin facts to help you decide if this might be the perfect breed for you:
As a toy dog breed a fully grown Japanese chin will be between 8-11 inches tall and weigh 4-9 pounds. This size makes them ideal travel companions and easy to maintain, however it comes at a cost since they can easily be injured when playing roughly with people and larger pets. Because of this it's recommended to supervise the breed when they are exposed to other animals and smaller children.
The Japanese chin is an intelligent happy dog. They have a charming behavior and enjoy all types of company around them. The breed's personality is known to match the lifestyle of their owner. Energetic Japanese chins normally come from energetic owners, while reserved Japanese chins often have owners that keep to themselves. As a companion dog the breed wants to be with their family all day and can suffer from separation anxiety if they are left alone for long periods of time.
The Japanese chin has a thick silky coat with feathering on the ears and the legs. They are a clean breed and don't require baths as frequently as other dogs with similar coats. The breed does shed, but brushing their coat weekly will help keep excess hair to a minimum. Japanese chins do well with children, but due to their small size they should not be left alone around smaller kids unsupervised (due to the high risk of the child unintentionally injuring the dog).
The history of the Japanese Chin is not completely agreed upon. The breed may have actually originated in China as small dogs often accompanied travelers and traders along the silk road. The Japanese Chin Club of America states that the European Continental toy spaniel was crossed with the Chinese Chin dog or "Imperial Chin" to produce what was would become the Japanese Chin. The club also suggests that the Pekingese likely was bred out from the Japanese Chin dogs.
It is known that some were kept and bred at Buddhist monasteries as early as 528 A.D. Eventually, as many toy breeds do, they found their way into palaces of royalty and nobility and were taken out of reach of the peasants. The breed graced the lap of every aristocratic lady and, rather ironically, these elites worshiped and doted on these little dogs-- they even had their own servants.
The end of Japan's isolationism in the mid 1850's marked the introduction of the breed to the west. Three pairs were given to Commodore Perry as gifts, although only one pair survived. Nevertheless, the gates of Japan were open and the breed caught the eye of Queen Alexandra of Britain during the late 1800's. Popularity of the Chin skyrocketed in England and, therefore, throughout Europe.
In 1888, the first Chin, Jap, was recognized by the AKC as a Japanese Spaniel. The name remained until 1977 when it was renamed the Japanese Chin.
A Japanese Chin dog looks much how you'd expect a far Eastern breed. There is the large, round head with the most distinctive features being the large, round eyes that are set wide apart and the short, flat muzzle. The ears have long feathering as is the tail that is held high and curled over the back. The tail may be difficult to see since it is so profusely plumed that it seems to flow into the rest of the coat. As for the coat, it is long, silky and luxurious; the only part of the body where it is short will be the head, muzzle and fronts of legs. Acceptable colors include black and white, black and white with tan points, or red and white. The thick coat stands out more on the head, shoulders and hind quarters making it appear as if he/she has a mane and is "wearing pants". A Japanese Chin puppy's coat may not grown in completely until he/she is 2-5 years of age.
The images below represent the coat colors and patterns associated with Japanese Chins.
The Japanese Chin dog breed has few variations among individuals. Although they can be a variety of colors their overall appearance is the same. Therefore, if you see a Short-haired Japanese Chin they have likely been groomed to look that way; the coat is naturally long and luxurious.
The breed is naturally toy sized. Japanese Chins advertised "teacup" sized should be regarded with caution. First, this size is not considered standard to the breed so there is a chance the Chin you are considering is not a purebred. Also, some smaller dogs can be the result of breeding two tiny, unhealthy individuals-- this results in puppies with more health issues.
A Japanese Chin's temperament is truly charming. They were bred purely as companions for aristocracy and act as such. Compared to other toy breeds they bark very little but will alert you if the situation calls for it. The Japanese Chin's personality is also said to be very cat like; they will clean themselves and are alert, intelligent creatures. Although content to warm your lap, they are also lively outdoors-- as long as you're spending time with them. The Chin dog breed is good for families and is typically friendly with other pets and strangers. They are adaptable to many different living environments as long as they get plenty of attention every day. Japanese Chin characteristics of intelligence and nobility allow them to be easily trainable and make them excellent travel buddies.
Japanese Chin are not hypoallergenic dogs. Their long, luxurious coats will need to be brushed about twice weekly to keep them free of mats and tangles. Other than that, the Chin breed is known for being cat-like in its grooming habits. They are very clean indoor companions and should be bathed on an as needed basis.
Members of this breed are very adaptable to new people and places. They make good apartment dogs due to the trait of being quieter than most toy breeds. Indoors they will be loving, devoted companions that desire to spend time with you daily. We recommend they don't live outdoors due to their love of human companionship.
Training should be fairly easy for this breed, even for a first time owner. The combination of alertness, intelligence and devotion renders them eager to please. However, if not given enough attention and exercise, this level of smarts can turn into nuisance behavior.
The Japanese Chin typically lives 10-12 years which is not quite as long as many toy breeds. Their short muzzles and prominent eyes make them susceptible to many environmental irritants like bacteria and dust. They are also prone to several hereditary issues. Below are health issues and concerns most common in Japanese Chins:
A few preventative measures can me taken to keep your Chin as healthy as possible. First, check the eye area for "boogers" or residue frequently and wipe with a wet cloth when necessary. Also, don't keep your Chin outdoors in hot weather for too long as this can cause respiratory distress. Finally don't skip your routine veterinary visits which can help detect heart, eye, joint and thyroid problems.
Below are potential health concerns associated with Japanese Chins.

Characteristics, care tips, and other helpful information for Japanese chin owners
With their silky fur and Â large wide-set eyes, the Japanese chin has endeared themselves to people for centuries. Bred to be a small companion dog to Chinese and Japanese emperors, the Japanese chin remembers their royal roots and can put on aristocratic airs. The Japanese chin is extremely affectionate to their family, including other dogs in the household, but can be a little wary of strangers. Many pet parents say that their Japanese chin has a cat-like personality, which may explain why they are also likely to get along with felines.
ð Coming up with a pet name can be fun but tricky. Search no further! According to PetScreeningâs 2024 database, the majority of our users name their male Japanese Chins Gizmo; Yoshi is the 2nd most popular male name. Meanwhile, most of our users with female Japanese Chins love Bella, then Lily.
The Japanese chin is a relatively healthy breed, but may be genetically susceptible to minor problems that are common in smaller breeds, such as cataracts and luxating patellas. Unfortunately, they may also carry Tay-Sachs disease, which is fatal. However, this can be determined with a DNA test thatâs recommended before breeding.
Enrolling your dog in a pet insurance policy can help you pay for any medical expenses that arise down the road. Some health insurance policies restrict coverage, such as not covering congenital or genetic conditions, so it pays to shop around before settling on a company. Â If you have a senior pet or a dog with preexisting conditions, it might be a better idea to create a pet savings account instead.
Pet insurance usually works by letting you pay the full vet bill up front on a credit card and receiving a reimbursement after filing a claim. A pet savings account may benefit you more in the long run since itâs impossible to know ahead of time whether youâll receive enough credit to cover the bill.
When Commodore Matthew Perry visited Japan during one of his 19th-century voyages, he couldnât help but notice a little lap dog that quietly resided in the emperorâs palace. Perry was allowed to take some Japanese chins back to the United States to give to his daughter and President Franklin Pierce. The story spread that heâd found a new dog from Japan, and this toy breed shortly became known as the Japanese spaniel in the West.
They were readily received by the American Kennel Club, who welcomed them in as the Japanese spaniel in 1888. Maybe these little dogs were responsible for opening trade between Japan and the United States. Only history can tell.
Since Perry discovered this little dog in Japan, he assumed that they were Japanese. This wasnât quite right. The Japanese chin was originally from China, where they were bred to please the Chinese emperor. Some possible ancestors include the Tibetan spaniel, the shih tzu, and the Pekingese.
In 1979, the âJapanese spanielâ was finally recognized as the Japanese chin in the West to honor their heritage.
Once you bring your Japanese chin puppy home, youâll need to take them on their first trip to the vet and schedule their vaccinations. Your puppy will also need heartworm prevention, and flea and tick control as well unless you live in a cold climate. As a new dog owner, itâs important to puppy-proof your home and prepare for teething. Puppies are curious by nature, so you should also secure them with an ID collar like FidoAlert just in case they wander off.
Despite their aristocratic airs, the Japanese chin does need to get off the couch for daily exercise to stay healthy. Even so, they donât require as much exercise as high energy breeds. A couple of ten or fifteen minute walks every day should suffice.
The Japanese chin has a silky single coat, which is fairly rare in the canine kingdom. This single coat still sheds, so theyâre not considered hypoallergenic. However, they should shed less than the average dog with a double coat. Their hair needs special care because itâs easily damaged due to its fine texture. You should brush their coat with a pin brush a few times a week to prevent tangles.
In addition to coat care, the Japanese chin will also need frequent nail trims, ear cleanings, and teeth brushing like most breeds.
Small dogs like the Japanese chin will probably only eat 1 cup or less of dry food each day, depending on what type of food. However, what they eat has a huge impact on their overall health, so itâs important to choose a food thatâs AAFCO-certified and well-balanced to meet their nutritional requirements. Your vet is a great source to determine what type of food best suits your dogâs age, lifestyle, breed, and individual health concerns.
Most Japanese chins are eager to please their owners, but believe they are the ruler of the house and may dislike authority at first. Start training them as early as possible in brief sessions with plenty of praise and treats. Once youâve established a relationship of friendship and trust with your chin, theyâll be more likely to listen.
Adopting a dog is a huge decision. If youâre not sure that a Japanese chin is quite right for you, here are some similar breeds you might also want to consider:
Yes. As an affectionate companion dog, the Japanese chin bestows all of their love on the people in their household. Small children will need to be taught not to push their buttons, but theyâre an excellent choice for older kids. They also tend to get along well with other dogs and cats, but early socialization is a better predictor than breed.
Although they share a similar lineage to popular breeds such as the shih tzu, the Japanese chin is a relatively uncommon breed. While you might find a shih tzu at a local shelter, youâll likely need to go through a reputable breeder or breed-specific rescue to find a Japanese chin.
Yes, the Japanese chin sheds. However, since they have a single coat, they might not shed as profusely as similar dogs with a double coat, such as the Pekingese.
