The West Highland White Terrier (commonly shortened to Westie) is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat and somewhat soft white undercoat. It is a medium-sized terrier, though with longer legs than other Scottish terriers. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance.
The Westie is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. It is an energetic, boisterous, and social breed with a high prey drive, having been bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms, and needs regular exercise of around one hour per day.[1] The modern breed is descended from a number of pre-20th century breeding programmes of white terriers in Scotland. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier but did not want to be known as such.
A cousin of the Cairn Terrier, other related breeds included the Roseneath Terrier (bred by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll) and Pittenweem Terriers (bred by Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman). The Westie was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time. The breed remains very popular in the United Kingdom, with multiple wins at Cruft's, and has been in the top third of all breeds in the United States since the 1960s. Several breed-specific and non-specific health problems appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed "Westie jaw", which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring.
Westies commonly have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect.[2] Members of the breed typically weigh between 15 and 20 pounds (6.8 and 9.1 kg) with an average height between 10–11 inches (25–28 cm) at the withers.[2] The body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder.[2]
Westies have a rough outer coat that can grow to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long[3] and a soft, dense, thick undercoat.[2] The fur fills out the face to give it a rounded appearance.[2] As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is normally removed by either "hand-stripping" (especially for dog-showing) or otherwise clipping.[2] Most Westies are pure white, although there are some light wheaten colour variations.[5]
The temperament of Westies can vary greatly, with some being friendly towards children and others preferring solitude.[citation needed] They will not typically tolerate rough handling, such as a child pulling on their ears or fur, and can frequently be both food- and toy-possessive.[citation needed] This makes regular training from a young age particularly important. Westies can make good watchdogs and are normally independent, self-assured, and confident. They are loyal and bond with their owner but are often on the move, requiring a minimum of one hour of daily exercise. Westies are highly social and are the most friendly of all the Scottish terriers.[6]
A hardy breed, Westies can be stubborn and cause issues with training, potentially requiring their training to be refreshed on occasion during their lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, they tend to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. They retain the instincts of an "earthdog" such as being inquisitive and investigative,[6] as well as natural instincts to bark and dig holes.[7] Westies are tied for 47th place (with the Scottish Deerhound) in Stanley Coren's 1994 book The Intelligence of Dogs, which designates them as being of "average working/obedience intelligence" and places them almost exactly in the middle of the list.[8]
A 2015 French study found a life expectancy of 12.93 years,[9] while 2024 British study found a life expectancy of 13.4 years (averaging 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds).[10] The typical litter size is between three and five puppies.[3]
The breed is pre-disposed to conditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal hernias.[11] Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as "lion jaw", and is sometimes also referred to as "Westie jaw".[12] The disease is an autosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both of its parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under one year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary.[13]
The breed is prone to skin disorders.[3] About one quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females.[14] An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers of any age. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and alopecia. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as an allergy or less serious forms of dermatitis.[15]
An inherited genetic problem that exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease wherein the dog lacks the enzyme galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed.[16] Another genetic condition that affects the breed is "white dog shaker syndrome". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other non-white breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.[17]
Other less common conditions which appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers.[18] A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed.[19] However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher.[20] The breed is also one of the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.[21] The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.[22]
Hyperplastic dermatosis of the West Highland White Terrier, also known as epidermal dysplasia or colloquially Armadillo Westie Syndrome, is an uncommon condition exclusively identified in the Westie. It is a severe chronic hyperplastic dermatological disease that is similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis and primary seborrhoea. Due to the fact that it is identified only in Westies, and evidence of familial involvement, it is believed to be an inherited trait. Malassezia infection is associated with the onset or worsening of symptoms. Symptoms involve generalised and serious patches of alopecia, erythema, lichenification, hyperpigmentation, malodor, otitis externa, and pruritus.[23][24]
A 2021 British study looking at clinical records found predispositions to chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular death, caused by either toxins or acute liver failure; compared to other dogs, Westies are 3.23 times more likely to contract chronic hepatitis and 3.87 times more likely to contract hepatocelluar death.[25] Copper storage diseases which affect the breed can result in chronic hepatitis.[26]
Scottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen of these white terriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a gift.[4] Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak.[27] At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.[28]
Reports of a ship from the Spanish Armada being wrecked on the island of Skye in 1588 indicated the ship carried white Spanish dogs, whose descendants were kept distinct from other breeds by Clan Donald, including the families of the Chiefs.[29] Other families on Skye preserved both white and sandy-coloured dogs. One such family was the Clan MacLeod, and it was reported by their descendants that at least two Chiefs kept white terriers, including "The Wicked Man" Norman MacLeod, and his grandson Norman, who became Chief after his death.[27]
George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, bred a breed of white Scottish terriers known as the "Roseneath Terrier".[30] Another breed of white Scottish terriers also appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife developing his line of "Pittenweem Terriers" out of a female Scottish Terrier which produced white offspring.[30] The dog seemed to produce these white puppies regardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of these offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He re-dedicated his breeding programme to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark-coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes being added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the 19th century.[31]
The person most closely associated with developing the modern breed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the "Poltalloch Terrier". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed.[30] It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred.[30] In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed. The term "West Highland White Terrier" first appears in Otters and Otter Hunting by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908.[30][32]
The first breed club was set up in 1904; Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, was the society's first president. A second club was subsequently set up, with the Countess of Aberdeen as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club's second chairman. Kennel Club recognition followed in 1907, and the breed appeared at Crufts for the first time in the same year.[30] The Westie was imported into the United States in 1907–1908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch. Kiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially, it was also known at the time as the Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1908. The club was renamed during the following year to the West Highland White Terrier Club of America.[28] The breed spent the period that immediately followed as being "in vogue",[33] becoming popular almost immediately upon its arrival in the US.[33] Canadian Kennel Club recognition followed in 1909.[30] Until 1924 in the UK, Westie pedigrees were allowed to have Cairn and Scottish Terriers in them. By the time of Malcolm's death in 1930, a stable type had appeared with prick ears, a white coat, and a short back.[30]
In major conformation shows, the breed has been equally successful on both sides of the Atlantic. The first member of the breed to win a show championship was Ch. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young. The dog was registered at the time as a Scottish Terrier, and won the title at the Scottish Kennel Club show at the age of seven months. Because the breed was not yet recognised independently, the championship title was not retained when the dog was reregistered as a West Highland White Terrier.[30] The first win at a major show came at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1942 when Constance Winant's Ch. Wolvey Pattern of Edgerstoune won the title of Best in Show.[34] The same title was taken by Barbara Worcester's Ch. Elfinbrook Simon in 1962.[35] It took a further 14 years before the breed took its first Best in Show title at Crufts, the UK's major dog show. Ch. Dianthus Buttons, owned by Kath Newstead and Dorothy Taylor, took the title for the breed in 1976.[36] A Westie also won Crufts in 1990 with the Best in Show title going to Derek Tattersall's Ch. Olac Moon Pilot,[37] and in 2016 to Burneze Geordie Girl.
The popularity of the breed during the early 20th century was such that dogs were being exchanged for hundreds of guineas.[38] As of 2010, the Westie is the third-most popular breed of terrier in the UK, with 5,361 puppies registered with the Kennel Club. However, this is a decrease in numbers since 2001, when it was the most popular terrier breed, with 11,019 new dogs registered.[39] The breed's position in the United States is more stable with it remaining in the top third of all breeds since around 1960.[28] It was ranked 30th-most popular in 2001, based on registrations with the American Kennel Club, which varied around the 30s in the decade after, with it ranked 34th in 2010.[40] It was the 44th-most popular AKC breed in 2020.[41]

The West Highland White Terrier is a small, spunky dog with a long history. These dogs are commonly referred to as Westies. Westies have been around since the 18th century and have been prized for their personality, energy, and appearance. Today, the West Highland White Terrier is extremely popular due to their size and personality. These dogs will appeal to a broad audience, including small dog lovers, families, and people who appreciate purebred dogs with a rich past. The West Highland White Terrier is the 43rd most popular dog breed in 2023, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC), out of 201 total breeds.

West Highland White Terrier puppies are simply divine. When they are young, the West Highland White Terrier is a fuzzy bundle of white that is extremely adorable, playful, and tiny. The best way to get a West Highland White Terrier puppy is to source one from a reputable breeder. You can find breeders through the American Kennel Club or the West Highland White Terrier Club of America. (Many local clubs deal solely in West Highland White Terriers.) The odds of stumbling across a West Highland White Terrier puppy in a shelter or at a rescue group are very slim.
The West Highland White Terrier can trace its origins back to the early 18th century on estates owned by Britain’s elite. Britain’s estates often oversaw large tracts of farmland and would store goods like grain, hay, fodder, and wine. These goods would attract the unwanted attention of rats, which would pillage the estates and spread disease. To combat this, the West Highland White Terrier was bred to hunt rats and keep other small pests away.
The first West Highland White Terriers were bred by a group of people known as the Malcolms in Scotland. The Malcolms lived on an estate called Poltalloch, and it was here that the first litters of Westies were born. From Poltalloch, the West Highland White Terrier spread to another nearby estate called Roseneath, where more breeding was done. From there, the dog spread out into the surrounding region. The dog became known as the West Highland White Terrier because it originated in the West Highlands of Scotland.
Westies were first shown in Scottish dog shows starting in 1896. From that point, they made their way to the United States. Just a decade later, in 1906, they were recognized by the AKC and started appearing in American dog shows. In the following century, the West Highland White Terrier gained fame and popularity in the United States and is one of the most popular breeds in the country today.

West Highland White Terriers are smart, independent, playful, friendly, and loyal. These dogs are almost always happy and are a joy to be around. One of the only bothersome considerations with the West Highland White Terrier’s temperaTerrier’sheir willingness to bark. West Highland White Terriers are labeled as alert. They will bark when strangers come around or when they see something outside that excites them. West Highland White Terriers are not particularly loud, but they can bark a lot, which might be frustrating to some potential owners. Barking can be mitigated, but it cannot be completely trained out of this breed. West Highland White Terriers can also be independent, which can verge on stubbornness in some individuals.
Yes. West Highland White Terriers are phenomenal family dogs. They get along swimmingly with small children and are known to play well with kids of almost any age. These dogs do not need intensive exercise or in-depth care, so they can be slotted into almost any family unit. West Highland White Terriers are people pleasers who love spending time with their owners and have no red flags when it comes to family life.
West Highland White Terriers are known to get along decently well with other dogs and with small animals like cats. The only type of pet that the West Highland White Terrier will not get along with are rodents. West Highland White Terriers were bred to be rodent killers, so they will not do well in houses with pets like hamsters, guinea pigs, or rats. West Highland White Terriers are relatively solitary so not every member of the breed will be thrilled with having other dogs in the house, but they are also adaptable and will get along fine with most dogs.

West Highland White Terriers have no specific diet requirements. You should put your West Highland White Terrier on a high-quality diet of well-formulated dry food. It is suggested that you feed your dog food based on its age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some people like to get food that benefits skin and coat health to keep their Westies looking their best. Outside of those general recommendations, the dog’s diet is up to dog’s owner’s discretioowner’s sure to follow feeding guidelines to avoid canine obesity.
West Highland White Terriers love to play, and they should be given ample opportunities to do so throughout the day. West Highland White Terriers love to sniff around outside and run perimeters, so a fenced yard is suggested. These dogs will enjoy two walks per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, but these walks do not have to be long or high-intensity. As long as the dog gets some outside time and some play time, they will be more than happy. West Highland White Terriers do not need extensive or intensive exercise.
West Highland White Terriers are trainable, but they can be stubborn and independent. West Highland White Terriers were bred to work alone, and therefore, they are very independent. Training them to do things that they don’t want to do is challenging. Thankfully, they are small and eager to please their owners, which helps in the process. Training of West Highland White Terriers has the best results when you start early. Socialization is recommended but not necessarily required due to their size and disposition. Many people neglect the training of small dogs due to their size, but you should not neglect basic training for a West Highland White Terrier.
Grooming is essential for West Highland White Terriers. These dogs have a long coat that needs to be brushed regularly. Baths are also recommended to eliminate mats and to break up dead hair and skin. You will likely need to employ a professional groomer for the best results. West Highland White Terriers should go to the groomer once every 4 to 6 weeks to get bathed and trimmed. Neglecting the coat of a West Highland White Terrier can cause skin irritation, dirty coats, discoloration, and matted fur. If you are not willing to keep up with the grooming needs of a dog like this, you should consider getting a dog with a shorter, more manageable coat.
West Highland White Terriers are considered to be a very healthy breed. Westies have very few serious health conditions compared to other breeds. The two biggest problems West Highland White Terriers will face are hip dysplasia, which can be screened out by responsible breeders, and potential cardiac problems. Neither of these issues is very common and can be eliminated through selective breeding. Minor health problems include poor dental health (regular dental evaluations and cleanings are recommended) and luxating patella. A luxating patella causes the knees to pop out of alignment during running, but they usually resolve on their own and can be managed if the problem is identified early.
Male and female West Highland White Terriers are very similar in size and disposition. Female West Highland White Terriers are slightly smaller and less powerful than their male counterparts. While females may only stand one inch shorter than males, they can weigh 5 pounds less. This makes females leaner and less muscular overall. If you want a smaller dog that is lighter and easier to handle, you will want to consider getting a female over a male.

Due to their genetic makeup, all West Highland White Terriers are white. White is the only color that is accepted for West Highland White Terriers. Some people claim to have come across black or black and white West Highland Terriers, but those people are mistaken. If you believe you’ve seen a black West Highland White Terrier, it is likely a mixed breed or a case of misidentification.
After the bubonic plague swept through Europe, people began to realize that pests like rats were dangerous. In the wake of the plague, many regions began to breed dogs to hunt rodents, such as rats specifically. The West Highland White Terrier is one such dog. The West Highland White Terrier was bred to seek out and hunt rats. When able, the West Highland White Terrier will kill rats on sight. If the dog cannot reach the rats on its own, it will bark to alert its owners of the presence of rodents on the property.
West Highland White Terriers have a number of names. The official name is the West Highland White Terrier, but they can also be referred to as West Highland Terriers or Westies. They have also been called Poltalloch Terriers and Roseneath Terriers. These names are derived from the estates that first bred West Highland White Terriers. That totals five distinct names that these dogs have been referred to over time, which is a lot of names for a little dog.

It will come as no surprise that the West Highland White Terrier has been a popular dog breed for over 300 years. These dogs are sociable, fun, small, cute, and adaptable. They make great family dogs or adept show dogs. While most people no longer need a dog to hunt rats on their property, the West Highland White Terrier is still beloved by thousands of people all around the globe. These dogs can fit into almost any family and are sure to delight people with their heartwarming personalities. It is easy to see why this small breed has spread far beyond the West Highlands of Great Britain and into the hearts of dog lovers everywhere.

The West Highland White Terrier, often known as the Westie, is a breed of dog from Scotland. Its ancestors include the Cairn Terrier and the now-extinct Scottish White Terrier. Bred to hunt foxes, badgers, and vermin, the breed gained popularity in the 19th century after it was developed by Col. Edward Donald Malcolm of Poltalloch, Scotland, who sought a white terrier that wouldn't be mistaken for game and accidentally shot while hunting.
West Highland White Terriers, also known as Westies, can suffer from conditions such as keratoconjunctivitis Sicca, patellar luxation, copper toxicosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD), cataracts, craniomandibular osteopathy, skin disease, deafness, and globoid cell leukodystrophy. Genetic testing for craniomandibular osteopathy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, and von Willebrand’s Disease I can assist veterinarians with diagnosis and proactive care, as well as help breeders identify affected and carrier dogs.
Westies are known for their lively and friendly disposition. They are intelligent, independent, and can be stubborn at times. They are very affectionate with their families and can be friendly towards strangers. Westies enjoy being the center of attention and are known for their bold and confident nature. Despite their small size, they are robust and love outdoor activities, such as chasing balls, playing, and going on walks.
Years ago the breed was known as the Roseneath Terrier, also as the Poltalloch Terrier. The name Roseneath was taken from the Duke of Argyll's place in Dumbartonshire, Scotland.The Westie's white color was specifically bred for safety during fox and badger hunts. Any other color could be mistaken for the game, leading to potential accidents.Despite their small size, Westies are known for their strong prey drive and can be quite fearless.Westies have a significant media presence. They have been used as the face of various brands and were even featured in the popular TV show "Hamish Macbeth."

Referred to as the Westie by the folks that know and love him, the wee West Highland White Terrier is a pint-sized pup that originally hails from Scotland. A hardy and happy breed, the West Highland White Terrier is recognizable for his white fur, perky ears, and big, dark eyes. A deeply devoted canine companion, the West Highland White Terrier craves love and attention and does best with tons of affection from the entire family.
If you’re thinking about adding a West Highland White Terrier to your household, here is your in-depth guide to everything you need to know about this playful pooch.

Cute and cuddly, West Highland White Terrier puppies look like miniature white teddy bears. As soon as you set your eyes on one, you’re almost guaranteed to want to scoop him up and bring him home with you. However, there are a few things to keep in mind before you bring the West Highland White Terrier with the cheapest price tag home with you.
The West Highland White Terrier is a sought-after breed and will cost you a pretty penny. But this doesn’t mean that you should purchase a Westie puppy from a back page or internet classifieds ad. You really need to do your homework about the breeder before you commit to buying a dog.
This is because there are plenty of bad dog breeders out there, including puppy mills and backyard breeders. Out to make quick and easy money, these breeders often have little to no concern about the health and happiness of the dogs they’re selling. Many times, these facilities confine dogs to small, unsanitary cages and never get routine wellness checks from a vet for the dogs they are breeding.
All of this can add up to one anxious and scared little puppy. While the low price tag may be appealing, West Highland White Terrier puppies from puppy mills are often psychologically and physically damaged, leading to a lot of heartache and steep training and vet bills later on down the road.
Today, there are more than 10,000 puppy mills operating in the United States. These facilities sell hundreds of thousands of dogs every year. Many of these puppies are prone to hereditary and congenital conditions, such as respiratory disorders, and more.
Worse yet, many of these puppies can arrive at their new homes with numerous other health problems, like kennel cough or intestinal parasites among other things. On top of that, there are many behavioral problems puppy mill dogs can have. They may be overly shy or fearful. And you are likely to have difficulty during crate and leash training.
If you’re scoping out different West Highland White Terrier breeders, it’s vital to ensure that they are both responsible and reputable. This will guarantee that you’re purchasing a happy and healthy puppy.
Your West Highland White Terrier is a little exterminator. Originally developed in Northwestern Scotland to kill rats and other pests, Westies were also used to hunt rabbits and foxes.
Yep, that’s right! Westies were bred with vibrant, white fur to help them stay visible while they were hunting.
In order to efficiently flush out vermin, West Highland White Terriers had to be small enough to squeeze into tight spaces.
Before you bring this breed home, you need to be sure the Westie dog is the right fit for you and your family. One way to determine this is to know all about his personality and intelligence.
The West Highland White Terrier is an extremely active and energetic dog, with brains to match. He isn’t suited for the lapdog lifestyle and needs a home where he’s going to get a lot of physical exercise.
Happy and eager to please, the Westie is a lively, loving dog that thrives on attention. However, the West Highland White Terrier can also be independent and stubborn at times.
Yes, but the West Highland White Terrier is better suited for a family with older children. Due to their innate desire to hunt small pests, quick-moving and tiny children may cause a Westie to chase and even nip.
Definitely! The Westie dogs love to be part of a pack and if socialized from an early age, will even get along with the family feline.
However, keep your Westie away from rabbits, guinea pigs, or hamsters.

Now that you know about the West Highland White Terrier’s temperament, let’s explore everything he needs from you in order to thrive.
How much your West Highland White Terrier eats will depend upon his age, size, and activity level. As a general rule of thumb, you should feed your Westie 0.5 to 1.5 cups of high-quality, grain-free dog food that is divided into two meals each day.
Ask your vet for their advice if you need further guidance.
The West Highland White Terrier is a spunky, sporty dog who needs a ton of exercise each and every day. He would not do well in a tiny apartment and needs plenty of room to roam, play, run, and explore.
Aim to give your Westie about 45 minutes to an hour of exercise every day. You should walk him at least once a day. If you’re gone from home for long periods of time, hire a dog walker or enroll your West Highland White Terrier in a doggy daycare.
In addition to physical stimulation, your West Highland White Terrier needs plenty of mental stimulation too to keep his sharp mind busy. If he gets bored, your Westie could get into some naughty behavior, such as excessive yapping or chewing.
The Westie is a very smart dog and loves to please. However, he can be willful and stubborn at times.
It’s important to establish your dominance from the very start. Firm, consistent, positive reinforcement training methods work best for Westies.
Westies have a double-layered white coat. You will need to brush him a couple times per week to avoid matting. Trimming is typically needed on his feet and around his eyes and ears.
Clean his ears and clips his nails as needed.
The West Highland White Terrier is a generally healthy little dog. But, like all dog breeds, he is prone to certain types of health issues.
This is why it is so important to buy a puppy from a good breeder. They can provide you with health clearances from both of the pup’s parents, proving that the dogs have been tested and cleared of certain types of conditions.
Male West Highland White Terriers can be a tad larger than females. However, both genders generally have the same personality traits.

If you’re seeking an adorable little dog to bring into your home, consider a West Highland White Terrier. Westies are perfect for active singles or families with older children. They need lots of attention and exercise, so if you’re not home a lot, this breed isn’t for you. But if you enjoy exercise and want a dog that can always go the distance, think about buying a West Highland White Terrier!

The West highland white terrier originated from Poltalloch in Scotland. So they were initially called as Poltalloch terrier and after that they were called as Roseneath terrier. They were initially used for hunting fox, badger, otter and in killing the vermin like rats.
The breed history says that Colonel Malcolm of Poltalloch was the reason for the Westie's white colour. This is because in 19th centuryhe went for hunting with his dogs and accidentally he shot his dog as its colour was as fox. So he decided to breed only white colour dogs.
The Westie can be said as that a small dog having the talents of the big dog. They are very popular for their obedience. They are also working as therapy dogs and also some in search and rescue teams. The home having Westie will have fun always and be enthusiastic. They will suit them for country or city living, but they like to live with their family. They are well suitable for apartment living, but some training should be given to them for not barking. They can stay in home when you are at work. Westie can be taken to travel, whether it may be long vacation or a short visit.
They are quick learners and so training them is not difficult. Mistakes of them can be corrected patiently since they don't like harsh activities against them. Westie will definitely bark when he sees something or hear different sounds. He will bark on seeing visitors or even other dogs. Sometimes they will bark for very silly things but when given appropriate training in their young stage, they can bark only for alerts.
The Westie is friendly with children but not all the time. So some care should be taken while they are near children.
They like to chase rodents like rabbits as they are interested in hunting.
They are suitable for apartment living unless they are left alone for a very long time. They love cold weather more than hot.
They can be trained by giving some extra efforts.
Itchy skin and pyoderma are common in terriers. Skin diseases such as Seborrhea and epidermal dysplasia are also found in them.
Westies have possibilities of getting yeast infections in skin[Malassezia Dermatitis] and due to that hair loss will be more.
The puppy should be fed 3 to 4 times per day as it requires a considerable amount for their growth. Cooked chicken breast and turkey are best for them and also vegetables should be given to them. Beef and chicken should be kept a limit as it will lead to itchy skin and allergies.
The preferable food for the Westie is home cooked. The home food will only contain all the essential nutrients for the Westie.
Eventhough the Westie is suitable for apartment living it is recommended to have a daily walk for him to be active and refreshing.
They should be made to play for atleast 30 minutes per day for their health as to not gain overweight. Grown up children can play with them as they like it.
