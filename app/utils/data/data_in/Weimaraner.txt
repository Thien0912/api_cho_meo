Weimaraners and cats can live together in harmony, but it requires patience, understanding, and a little effort from both parties.
Weimaraners are naturally energetic dogs that need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behavior.
Cats, on the other hand, value their independence and may not appreciate the Weimaraner's enthusiasm.
Introducing a Weimaraner to a cat household requires a gradual and controlled process to prevent stress and anxiety for both animals.
A slow introduction allows the Weimaraner to become familiar with the cat's scent, sounds, and movements, reducing the likelihood of an aggressive reaction.
In some cases, Weimaraners may view cats as playmates, but this can lead to over-exuberance and potentially harm the cat.
Introducing a Weimaraner and Cat requires careful planning and patience. The key is to create positive associations and gradual introductions to help both animals feel comfortable and secure.
You'll need to have patience, and you should never force an interaction if one or both pets seem nervous or hesitant. This is especially true when introducing a Weimaraner to a cat, as they can be a high-energy breed with a strong prey drive.
Use a baby gate or a secure barrier to allow your Weimaraner and cat to see each other without direct contact. This will enable them to observe each other's body language and reactions while maintaining a safe distance.
It's essential to prioritize your cat's safety when introducing them to a Weimaraner, especially if you have a kitten. Your chances of success are greater if you introduce a kitten instead of an adult cat, as dogs often intuitively sense when a creature is young.
You might even want to introduce scents before sights, such as letting your dog sniff a blanket or toy that belongs to your cat. In the animal kingdom, sniffing is like reading someone's social media bio before meeting them in person.
Dogs often receive the most negative attention over territorial issues, but cats are actually much more aggressively possessive. Suddenly introducing an adult dog into your cat's domain can make your cat feel threatened, which almost always results in hiding or direct confrontation.
You should let your cat roam around when introducing them to the puppy, and save a spot in the house for your cat where the dog isn't allowed to visit. This will give your cat a safe space to retreat to if they feel overwhelmed.

Unless they've been raised together since puppyhood, Weimaraners will view small furry creatures as prey, including kittens.
Introducing an adult Weimaraner to a cat can be disastrous if they're not accustomed to being around small animals.
Hyper and energetic Weimaraners might not suit most cats, and a timid cat is more likely to engage a Weimaraner's prey drive.
You should have patience when introducing a Weimaraner to a cat, and never force an interaction if one or both pets seem nervous or hesitant.
Creating positive associations and gradual introductions is key to helping both animals feel comfortable and secure.
Controlled visual introductions, where the Weimaraner and cat can see each other without direct contact, can help them observe each other's body language and reactions.
Supervised interactions between a Weimaraner and cat are crucial to their successful coexistence.
No matter how well they get along, leaving a Weimaraner and cat unsupervised is not recommended.
A Weimaraner's high energy levels and prey drive mean they'll need a couple of hours of daily exercise to feel happy and healthy.
If your Weimaraner has a high prey drive or responds aggressively towards small creatures, a cat might not be the best pet for you.
If your Weimaraner has a sweet spot towards smaller animals, introducing a kitten might be a better option than an adult cat.

Creating a safe and harmonious environment for both your Weimaraner and cat is crucial to their coexistence.
To prevent food-related conflicts, it's essential to have separate feeding areas for your cat and Weimaraner.
This will allow your cat to eat in peace without feeling threatened by the presence of the dog.
To prepare your home for a Weimaraner and cat, creating a safe and harmonious environment is crucial to their coexistence.
Cats and Weimaraners should have separate feeding areas to prevent any potential food-related conflicts.
This will also allow your cat to eat in peace without feeling threatened by the presence of the dog.
Creating separate spaces for your Weimaraner and cat is essential to their overall well-being and comfort.
Having separate areas for your pets will help reduce stress and anxiety, making it easier for them to coexist peacefully.
Securing your outdoor areas is a must, especially if you have a Weimaraner. They are known for their athleticism and love for outdoor activities, so a tall fence with no gaps is recommended to prevent them from chasing or injuring neighborhood cats.
Weimaraners are naturally curious, so a securely fenced yard will give you peace of mind knowing they can't escape or get into trouble.
A tall fence is essential, as it will prevent your Weimaraner from jumping over or digging under the fence.

Creating separate spaces for your Weimaraner and cat is crucial in reducing tension and aggression. This allows each animal to have its own territory and feel more comfortable.
Cats may exhibit stress signals such as dilated pupils, flattened ears, or a swishing tail, while Weimaraners may show signs of stress like panting, pacing, or excessive barking.
Over time, you should see gradual progress in the interactions between your Weimaraner and cat, but some animals may never become best friends, and that's okay.
Living with a Weimaraner and a cat may come with its fair share of challenges. One common challenge is the potential for resource guarding, where Weimaraners may defend their food or toys from the cat.
Weimaraners are naturally protective of their family and territory, which can sometimes lead to conflicts with the cat.
To address this, you can try feeding your Weimaraner and cat in separate rooms to prevent resource guarding.
House soiling is another common issue that can arise when introducing a Weimaraner to a cat household.
Weimaraners are intelligent and active dogs that require regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behavior.
Providing your Weimaraner with enough physical and mental stimulation can help reduce the likelihood of house soiling.
Introducing a Weimaraner to a cat household can be a daunting task, but with patience and careful planning, it can be a successful experience for all involved.
Weimaraners are social dogs that thrive on interaction and attention from their family.
By gradually introducing the Weimaraner to the cat and providing a safe and comfortable environment for both pets, you can help ensure a harmonious household.
Living with a Weimaraner and a cat can be a harmonious experience, but it requires the right approach. Proper socialization is key to fostering a positive relationship between the two.
Through consistent training and creating separate spaces, you can help your Weimaraner and cat live together in peace. Every dog and cat is unique, so individual results may vary.
It's essential to gauge your Weimaraner's temperament and consider your cat's personality before making a decision. Consulting with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist can provide valuable guidance tailored to your specific situation.
With patience, dedication, and proper training, Weimaraners and cats can live harmoniously together, enriching each other's lives and bringing joy to your home.

Weimaraner or Weim is a sleek-looking dog breed known for its blue-grey shiny coat, unusual eyes and aristocratic presence. Weimaraners are originally from Germany and were used for hunting large game and accompanying their owners on the field at all times. Due to this deep bond they always shared with people, they are extremely attached to their owners and problems with separation anxiety are not uncommon among Weimaraners.
Large and athletic, Weims are good hunters and love running and all sorts of exercise. They have a strong prey drive, which makes them unsuitable to share a living with small furry pets. They can be quite demanding, as they tend to be stubborn and strong-willed, but they are also loving and extremely loyal, being the perfect house pet for those up to the task.
Weimaraners probably descend from a breed that is now extinct, the Chien-Gris (or Grey St. Louis Hound). This breed goes back to the 13th century and was used for hunting in the court of the king Louis IX of France. Some think that Weimaraners descend from the St. Hubert Hound (or bloodhound). In any case, the Weimaraner we know today started to be developed as a breed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the city of Weimar, thus the name. They are believed to be a mix of  Bloodhound,  English Pointer,  German Shorthaired Pointer, blue  Great Dane, and Huehnerhund (chicken dog).
Back in the 19th century, the Weimaraner, or the Weimar Pointer, as it was called then, was used for hunting large game, such as deer, bears and wolves, but as the German forests began to disappear, along with these animals, the breed started to be used for hunting smaller preys. They were bred exclusively for the nobility, who was after a distinctive, royal-looking hunting dog. Weimaraners were kept at home, not in kennels like other hunting dogs, which resulted in an affectionate family dog. In 1897, nobles created an exclusive club to keep the breed’s standards and control them. Anyone wanting to buy a Weimaraner had to be part of the club. In fact, Germans were so proud of their unique breed that the dogs that were sent to America were sterilized to prevent breeding and the consequent increase in their numbers.
In 1929, Howard Knight, an American fancier of the breed, tried to take some of these Weimaraners to breed in the United States, but his mission failed. Later in 1938, he finally made it and the breed started to proliferate in America. A few years later, the Weimaraner Club of America was created and the breed was recognised by the American Kennel Club. With the advent of World War II, many Weimaraners were sent to America in an attempt to save the breed – further increasing the dog breeding pool.
Later in the sixties throughout the eighties, Weimaraners became incredibly popular in the United States. The famous photographer William Wegman played an important role in the popularization of the breed, as he is known for his series of compositions involving his own Weimaraners (Man Ray, Fay Ray, and Fay Ray’s offspring) in various costumes, wearing wigs, and posing in different settings. Increased popularity led to irresponsible breeding at that time, which could fortunately be overcome by dedicated breeders who worked hard to restore Weimaraners’ health, temperament, and conformation standards. Nowadays, the Weimaraner is ranked number 30 among the 155 breeds and types recognised by the American Kennel Club.
Weimaraners are large, elegant dogs that come in different shades of grey/blue:
Their coat is short and smooth. There is also a longhaired variety, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club and it is a recessive trait, so both parents must be longhaired for a puppy to be longhaired too. The eyes of a Weimaraner can vary from light amber, grey, to blue-grey. They have webbed paws, which make them great swimmers, and their tail reaches to the hocks, although it has been traditionally docked in countries where it is permitted.
A male Weimaraner usually weighs between 32 and 37 kg (71-82 lb) and measures 63 to 68 cm (25-27 inches), while a female weighs between 25 and 32 kg (55-71 lb) and measures 58 to 63 cm (23-25 inches).
Nicknamed “The Grey Ghost” for its unusual blue coat, the Weimaraner is an all-purpose gun dog possessing great stamina and physical endurance. Although slower than other gun dogs, they are thorough and work-oriented. Very intelligent and courageous, Weimaraners were developed to be close to people, which makes them devoted pets that tend to be attached to their owners. Separation anxiety is well recognised in the breed, as well as their behaviour in such episodes. They will bark, howl, dig, and panic, destroying everything around them and even injuring themselves.
Weimaraners are good at hunting, tracking, pointing, and retrieving both from land and water, as they are good swimmers. They need mental stimulation, lots of exercise, but above all, they need to be close to their owners, whom they will follow everywhere. They are good with children and they make wonderful companions, as their bond with humans is very strong. They are loving and lively, always motivated by reward. They are quite sensitive too, and they become easily offended by harsh training or reprimands. It is not unusual for them to present their owners with gifts of dead things (frogs, birds, mice) and they expect to be rewarded accordingly.
Because they are inherently hunting dogs, they have a strong drive for chasing smaller animals and even joggers or bicyclists. Even if acquainted with cats or other small furry pets, Weimaraners should not be left alone with them, as they will respond to their most basic instincts to hunt and they may hurt and kill them. Apart from that, they are friendly dogs, as well as being very smart and assertive. Weimaraners’ fearlessness and wilfulness may translate into a certain degree of domination – both towards other dogs and owners. They can be stubborn, manipulative, and obstinate. With its strong-willed and independent mind, the Weimaraner can be quite demanding and challenging.
The Weimaraner has a great presence and a strong character. It can be wary of strangers, which, along with its alert character, makes it a good guard good. Aggression and extreme shyness are flaws that must be prevented by a correct and early socialisation and training. Nevertheless, Weimaraners are happy companions with a playful and loyal attitude.
Weimaraners should be trained at an early age, as they are a demanding breed and sometimes tough to house-train. Crate training is advised and a firm but gentle treatment should be applied. Weimaraners are sensitive and may become resentful of punishment or harsh training towards them.
Obedience classes are helpful to teach them how to be calm and to control both their dominant temperament and their strong chasing instinct. Early socialisation is also beneficial for a healthy adult life since they tend to be suspicious of strangers. Traits like aggression or shyness are preventable through correct training and socialisation.
Weimaraners are large dogs that live between 11 and 14 years. They have the potential to develop the following health issues:
Because Weimaraners are a large breed with a deep chest, they are more prone to having a bloated stomach that can twist around itself, blocking the circulation. It usually occurs after a large meal followed by exercise and the signs are restlessness, anxiety, attempts to vomit, coughing, and extreme discomfort. Treatment is surgical but the problem can be prevented by feeding the dog several small meals a day and not allowing it to exercise right after.
Cancer (Mastocytoma & Fibrosarcoma)
These are two types of cancer that may occur in Weimaraners. Mastocytomas are mast cell tumours and fibrosarcomas are considered as a group of tumours affecting different types of cells but all resembling each other. Both types are malignant and may considerably shorten a Weimaraner’s lifespan.
Hip Dysplasia
More frequent in larger dog breeds, hip dysplasia results from an abnormally formed hip joint. The constant wear and tear of the defective articulation causes inflammation, pain, and lameness. The condition is diagnosed with X-rays and hip scoring tests and the treatment available aims at alleviating the symptoms.
Skin Allergies
Skin allergies are characterized by intense itching of the affected regions and consequent licking, chewing, or scratching of the skin, which may lead to lesions and further bacterial skin infections. Treatment is usually based on anti-inflammatory medication.
Heart Disease
Tricuspid valve malformation is a condition that may occur in Weimaraners and consists of an abnormal heart valve that does not close completely, thus resulting in the blood that is pumped from the atrium into the ventricle being sent back into the atrium. The condition affects the blood flow, thus preventing the normal functioning of the heart.
Exercise and Activity Levels
Weimaraners love being outdoors with their owners and they need lots of exercise and games. They are demanding regarding exercise and also mental stimulation, as they are very intelligent dogs. They can live a happy life in an apartment if they are provided with enough exercise opportunities. They love to run and they love water.
A fenced yard will work best for them to vent all their energy and also prevents them from chasing potential preys. Weimaraners do not deal well with confinement and they master the art of escaping, either by digging holes, jumping fences, or opening doors, so it is important not to leave them alone for long periods of time or without supervision. 
Grooming
The Weimaraner’s short coat is easy to maintain and a weekly brush with a bristle brush usually suffices to keep its coat looking at its best. Additionally, wiping its silvery coat with a chamois will keep it shiny and healthy-looking. Because they have pendant ears, owners should check for signs of redness or swelling, as they are prone to inflammation and otitis.
Famous Weimaraners
Popular references to the breed include:

Man Ray, a famous Weimaraner that died in 1982 and was owned by the photographer, William Wegman. Wegman popularised Weimaraners in his art works that portrayed Man Ray in costumes and poses.
Fay Ray, Wegman’s female Weimaraner that followed Man Ray’s legacy. Both Fay Ray and its offspring were used in the photographer’s famous creations.
Heidi was the dog of the American president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Heidi was rehomed to the family’s property after ruining a very expensive carpet in the White House.

The Weimaraner is a handsome dog with their lovely silvery coats and light coloured eyes. They are native to Germany where they have always been highly prized for their hunting skills and the fact they make such wonderfully loyal family pets. But they are not the best choice for first time dog owners because Weimaraners are highly intelligent and quickly pick up on things including if an owner is not the alpha dog which sees them show a more dominant side to their natures. They are much happier living with people who lead active outdoor lives and who would like a strong canine companion at their side.
Today Weimaraners are often used as assistance dogs throughout the world thanks to the fact that in the right hands and environment they are so intelligent and good natured. Often referred to as Weims these elegant dogs have found their way into the hearts and homes of many people here in the UK and are becoming a big hit in the show ring too thanks to their charming looks and loyal intelligent personalities.
The history of the Weimaraner remains a bit of a mystery although similar looking dogs are depicted in paintings by Van Dyke that date back to the 1600's. The dogs were bred in Weimar an independent state where they were highly prized for their smart looks intelligence and their hunting skills more especially their ability to hunt point track and retrieve over all sorts of challenging terrains.
There are those who believe the breed could be a relative to the German Short-Haired Pointer and that both breeds share a common ancestry. It is also thought the breed came about by crossing Schweisshund breeds with Bloodhounds.
They take their name from the Grand Duke of Weimar and were once the preferred dog of nobility on the hunting field where they were used to track down large prey. This included wildcats deer mountain lions bears and wolves. However by the 1800's large game became rarer in Germany which led to Weimaraners numbers falling too.
For many years not much was known about their breeding because the Germans kept this a close secret. However in 1937 the first Weim was taken over to America and a few years later in 1943 the breed was recognised by the American Kennel Club. It was not until 1952 that Weimaraners were introduced to the UK by Major Petty who had become a breed enthusiast during the time he served in the army in Germany.
Today they are a popular choice as rescue and assistance dogs for the disabled. In many parts of Europe the Weimaraner is used by the Police and over the years they have proved themselves to be reliable and trustworthy companion dogs and family pets which has helped the breed gain popularity both in the UK and elsewhere in the world.
Height at the withers: Males 63 - 68 cm Females 58 - 63 cm
Average weight: Males 32 - 37 kg Females 25 - 32 kg
Their eyes are set nicely apart on a dog's face medium in size and a round shape with Weimers always having an alert kind and intelligent look in them. Their ears are long set high being long nicely lobular and have a slight fold in them. The Weimer has a strong jaw with a perfect scissor bite where their upper teeth neatly overlap their lower ones. Their necks are moderately long and clean-cut which adds to their overall elegant appearance. Front legs are strong powerful and straight.
When it comes to their coat the Weimaraner has a short sleek and smooth coat with the hair on their necks chests and bellies being longer than on the rest of the body. Longer coated Weimaraners have longer coats with the hair on their chests necks and bellies being anything from 2.5 to 5cms long and their tails and backs of their legs are nicely feathered too. The accepted breed colours for registration are as follows:
When a Weimaraner moves they do so effortlessly while covering a tremendous amount of ground when they do. They are well balanced nicely coordinated dogs that when seen from behind their back feet move in a parallel motion to their front ones. When seen from the side a Weimaraner has a strong and level topline when moving.
The Kennel Club frowns on any sort of exaggerations or departures from the breed standard and would judge any faults on how much they affect a dog’s overall health and wellbeing as well as their ability to perform or work.
Males should have both testicles fully descended into their scrotums and it is worth noting that Weimaraners can be a little shorter or taller as well as slightly lighter or heavier than stated in the KC breed standard which is to be used as guideline only.
The Weimaraner is an energetic and proud dog and one that boasts huge amount of stamina. They are immensely smart and quickly differentiate between owners they can respect and those they can show a more dominant side to the natures to which is why they are better suited to people who are familiar with their specific needs. They were originally bred for life in the field which in short means it would be hard to over-exercise a mature Weim. They are happiest living with families who lead active outdoor lives and who live in the country or who boast large back gardens.
Weimaraners are often quite highly-strung dogs which in short means they need to be carefully handled and trained from a young age but because they mature quite slowly this needs to be taken into account during their training. In short to successfully train a Weimaraner often takes a lot of time patience and understanding.
Weimaraners form strong bonds with their families becoming totally devoted to their owners which means they are best suited to households where at least one person stays at home when everyone else is out of the house. They are known to follow their owners around the house from room to room so they can be with them. If a Weimaraner spends too much time on their own they are likely to suffer from separation anxiety which can lead to dogs developing all sorts of behavioural issues and this includes being destructive around the house.
They are not a good choice for first time owners because Weimaraners are better suited to people who are familiar with their specific needs and who know how to handle and train what can only be described as a sensitive smart although sometimes highly strung and often demanding dog. They are not the best choice for people who live in apartments either because Weimaraners thrive in being in an outdoor environment as much as possible.
Weimaraners as previously mentioned are not the best choice for first time dog owners because they need to be carefully and gently handled and trained while all the time showing dogs a lot of patience and understanding.
Weimaraners were originally bred to hunt point track and retrieve but because they are highly trainable in the right environment and with the correct training a dog can be taught not to chase smaller animals they come across. With this said a badly bred and incorrectly trained Weimaraner would happily take off after smaller animals they see which means great care must be taken as to where and when they can to run free off the lead.
Weimaraners are sensitive and sometimes highly-strung dogs but in the right hands they can be relaxed and playful. They learn new things quickly and enjoy playing interactive games with the people they trust and love.
Weimaraners are not that adaptable to apartment living doing a whole lot better in homes with large secure back gardens that dogs can safely roam around in whenever possible. They need a tremendous amount of daily physical exercise combined with lots of mental stimulation to be truly happy dogs.
Because Weimaraners become so devoted to their families they hate it when they find themselves on their own for any length of time which is why they are better suited to people who work from home who lead busy outdoor lives and people who spend as much time in the great outdoors are they can preferring to do so with a loyal canine companion that boasts a tremendous amount of stamina. Dogs that are left alone suffer from separation anxiety which sees them becoming destructive around the home which is their way of relieving their boredom and the stress they are feeling.
Weimaraners are not known to be "barkers" although any dog that's left on their own for too long might show their stress by barking incessantly to get attention. If a puppy or young dog starts to bark for no reason this sort of behaviour must be gently nipped in the bud earlier on being careful not to frighten them bearing in mind that Weimaraners need to be handled carefully so as not to upset them.
Most Weimaraners love swimming and will take to the water whenever they can more especially when the weather is hot. However if anyone who owns a dog that does not like water should never force them to go in because it would just end up scaring them. With this said care should always be taken when walking a Weim off the lead anywhere near more dangerous watercourses just in case a dog decides to leap in and then needs rescuing.
Weimaraners should not be taught to be guard dogs and it would be a serious mistake to attempt to train a dog to be guard because it would only bring out the worst in them and this includes Weims being aggressive and dominant. With this said a Weim would always let their owner know when there are strangers about or if something they don't like is going on in their environment.
The Weimaraner is a highly intelligent character that’s known to be "quick-witted" which is why they do better with people who are familiar with this type of extremely smart dog. Their socialisation and training has to start early and it must be consistent throughout a dog's life. Weimaraners need to know their place in the pack and who is the alpha dog in a household. Without the right sort of guidance they may start to show a more dominant side to their nature which is something to be avoided at all costs bearing in mind that these handsome dogs are extremely confident by nature.
In the right hands and environment Weimaraners are easy to train. They thrive on knowing who they can look to for direction and guidance. They are the sort of dog that needs to know what an owner expects of them. They do not respond well to any sort of harsh correction or heavy-handed handling but they do answer extremely well to positive reinforcement training which gets the best out of a Weimaraner because this type of training method brings out their natural talents.
Puppies need to be well socialised from a young age and their education must start early too so that they understand the limits and boundaries set for them. The first commands a puppy should be taught are as follows:
Weimaraners are known to be good around children and they enjoy playing interactive games with the kids. However they are a better choice in households where the children are older and therefore know how to behave around large dogs bearing in mind that a Weimaraner also needs to be taught that the kids must be respected too. With this said care must be taken when a Weimaraner is around toddlers because they may accidentally knock a smaller child over which could end up scaring or hurting them.
When well socialised from a young enough age Weimaraners generally get on well with other dogs although they can be a little "off" with some dogs. However care has to be taken when they are around smaller animals and pets just in case. If they have grown up with a family cat in the home they usually get on well together but a Weimaraner would think nothing of chasing a cat they don't already know and would take great delight in doing so.
The average life expectancy of a Weimaraner is between 11 and 14 years when properly cared for and fed an appropriate good quality diet to suit their ages.
The Weimaraner is known to be a healthy dog and one that suffers from few hereditary health issues. The conditions that seem to affect the breed the most are as follows:
Working Weimaraners have traditionally had their tails docked a practice that has been going on throughout time. The reason spaniel's tails were docked was to prevent them from being damaged when dogs were flushing out and retrieving game in undergrowth. It was only in 1993 that a law was passed preventing anyone other than a vet from carrying out the procedure but this was further changed when The Animal Health and Welfare Act (Scotland) came into effect in 2006 which invoked a total ban on tail docking unless for medical reasons.
In other parts of the UK the Animal Welfare Act came into effect in April 2007 which meant that dog's tails could no longer be docked unless they fell into the category of a specific "working" dog or for medical reasons.
Weimaraner puppies would have been given their initial vaccinations before being sold but it is up to their new owners to make sure they have their follow-up shots in a timely manner with the vaccination schedule for puppies being as follows:
There has been a lot of discussion about the need for dogs to have boosters. As such it's best to talk to a vet before making a final decision on whether a dog should continue to have annual vaccinations which are known as boosters.
A lot of vets these days recommend waiting until dogs are slightly older before spaying and neutering them which means they are more mature before undergoing the procedures. As such they advise neutering males and spaying females when they are between the ages of 6 to 9 months old. Other vets recommend spaying and neutering dogs when they are 6 months old but never any earlier unless for medical reasons.
Some Weimaraners gain weight after they have been spayed or neutered and it's important to keep an eye on a dog's waistline just in case they do. If a dog starts to put on weight it's important to adjust their daily calorie intake and to up the amount of exercise they are given. Older Weimaraners too are more prone to gaining weight and again it's essential they be fed and exercised accordingly because obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years. The reason being that it puts a lot of extra strain on a dog's internal organs including the heart.
Weimaraners are prone to suffering from allergies and more especially a condition known as Juvenile pyoderma which affects puppies and younger dogs. As such it's important for a dog to see a vet sooner rather than later if one flares up. Any form of other type of allergy can be notoriously hard to clear up and finding the triggers can be challenging. With this said a vet would be able to make a dog with an allergy more comfortable while they try to find out the triggers which could include the following:
All responsible Weimaraner breeders would ensure that their stud dogs are tested for known hereditary and congenital health issues known to affect the breed by using the following scheme:
Other than the standard breeding restrictions for all Kennel Club registered breeds Weimaraners can either have a smooth coat or a long-haired coat and breeders can choose to register their puppies as being long-haired with the Kennel Club.
It is mandatory for all KC Assured Breeders to use the following scheme on all stud dogs and the Kennel Club strongly advises other breeders to follow suit:
The Kennel Club also recommends that all breeders adhere to the following advice:
As with any other breed Weimaraners need to be groomed on a regular basis to make sure their coats and skin are kept in top condition. They also need to be given regular daily exercise to ensure they remain fit and healthy. On top of this dogs need to be fed good quality food that meets all their nutritional needs throughout their lives.
It's best to arrange to pick puppy up when people in the home are going to be around for the first week or so which is the time needed for a puppy to settle in. Puppy-proofing the home and garden means putting away any tools and other implements that a boisterous puppy might injure themselves on. Electric wires and cables must be put out of their reach because puppies love chewing on things. Toxic plants should be removed from flowerbeds and the home too.
Puppies need to sleep a lot to grow and develop as they should which means setting up a quiet area that's not too out of the way means they can retreat to it when they want to nap and it's important not to disturb them when they are sleeping. It's also a good idea to keep "playtime" nice and calm inside the house and to have a more active "playtime" outside in the garden which means puppies quickly learn to be less boisterous when they are inside.
The documentation a breeder provides for a puppy must have all the details of their worming date and the product used as well as the information relating to their microchip. It is essential for puppies to be wormed again keeping to a schedule which is as follows:
There are certain items that new owners need to already have in the home prior to bringing a new puppy home. It's often a good idea to restrict how much space a puppy plays in more especially when you can't keep an eye on what they get up to bearing in mind that puppies are often quite boisterous which means investing in puppy gates or a large enough playpen that allows a Weimaraner puppy the room to express themselves while keeping them safe too. The items needed are therefore as follows:
All puppies are sensitive to noise including Weimaraner puppies. It's important to keep the noise levels down when a new puppy arrives in the home. TVs and music should not be played too loud which could end up stressing a small puppy out.
As previously mentioned Weimaraner puppies would have been given their first vaccinations by the breeders but they must have their follow up shots which is up to their new owners to organise. The vaccination schedule for puppies is as follows:
When it comes to boosters it's best to discuss these with a vet because there is a lot of debate about whether a dog really needs them after a certain time. However if a dog ever needed to go into kennels their vaccinations would need to be
Older Weimaraner need lots of special care because as they reach their golden years they are more at risk of developing certain health concerns. Physically a Weimaraner will start to have a greying muzzle but there will be other noticeable changes too which includes the following:
Older dogs change mentally too which means their response time tends to be slower as such they develop the following:
Living with a Weimaraner in their golden years means taking on a few more responsibilities but these are easily managed and should include rethinking a dog’s diet the amount of exercise they are given how often their dog beds need changing and keeping an eye on the condition of their teeth.
Older Weimaraner need to be fed a good quality diet that meets their needs at this stage of their lives all the while keeping a close eye on a dog's weight. A rough feeding guide for older Weimaraners is as follows bearing in mind they should be fed highly digestible food that does not contain any additives:
Older Weimaraner don't need to be given the same amount of daily exercise as a younger dog but they still need the right amount of physical activity to maintain muscle tone and to prevent a dog from putting on too much weight. All dogs need access to fresh clean water and this is especially true of older dogs when they reach their golden years because they are more at risk of developing kidney disorders.
A Weimaraner's coat is short and tight lying close to the body which means they are low maintenance in the grooming department. All it takes is a weekly brush and a wipe over with a chamois leather to keep a nice sheen on a dog's coat and to keep it in good condition. They tend to shed throughout the year although like other breeds they shed the most during the Spring and then again in the Autumn when more frequent brushing is generally necessary to remove dead and loose hair from a dog's coat.
It's also important to check a dog's ears on a regular basis and to clean them when necessary. If too much wax builds up in a dog's ears it can lead to a painful infection which can be hard to clear up. In short prevention is often easier than cure when it comes to ear infections bearing in mind that Weimaraners are very prone to suffering from ear issues.
The Weimaraner is a very smart high energy character and as such they need to be given the right amount of daily exercise and mental stimulation for them to be truly happy well-rounded dogs. They need to be given a minimum of 2 hour's exercise every day with as much “off the lead time” as possible which needs to be combined with lots of mental stimulation. Without the right amount of exercise and things to keep their minds busy a Weimaraner would quickly get bored and this can lead to dogs developing all sorts of unwanted and destructive behaviours around the house.
A shorter walk in the morning would be fine but a longer more interesting one in the afternoon is a must. These dogs also like to be able to roam around a back garden as often as possible so they can really let off steam. However the fencing has to be extremely secure to keep these active high energy dogs in because if they find a weakness in the fence they will soon escape out and get into all sorts of trouble.
With this said Weimaraner puppies should not be over exercised because their joints and bones are still growing. This includes not letting a dog jump up and down from furniture or going up or down the stairs. Too much pressure placed on their joints and spines at an early age could result in a dog developing serious problems later in their lives.
If you get a Weimaraner puppy from a breeder they would give you a feeding schedule and it's important to stick to the same routine feeding the same puppy food to avoid any tummy upsets. You can change a puppy's diet but this needs to be done very gradually always making sure they don't develop any digestive upsets and if they do it's best to put them back on their original diet and to discuss things with the vet before attempting to change it again.
Older dogs are not known to be fussy or finicky eaters but this does not mean you can feed them a lower quality diet. It's best to feed a mature dog twice a day once in the morning and then again in the evening making sure it's good quality food that meets all their nutritional requirements. It's also important that dogs be given the right amount of exercise so they burn off any excess calories or they might gain too much weight which can lead to all sorts of health issues. Obesity can shorten a dog's life by several years so it's important to keep an eye on their waistline from the word go.
Because Weimaraners are known to suffer from bloat it is very important for them to be fed twice a day instead of giving a dog just one larger meal a day. It's also a good idea to invest in a stand for their feed bowls which makes it easier for these large dogs to eat comfortably without having to stretch down to reach their food. Dogs should never be exercised just before or just after they have eaten either because this puts them more at risk of suffering from gastric torsion.
Puppies need to be fed a highly nutritious good quality diet for them to develop and grow as they should. As a rough guide a Weimaraner puppy can be fed the following amounts every day making sure their meals are evenly spread out throughout the day and it's best to feed them 3 or 4 times a day:
Once a puppy is 15 months old they can be fed adult dog food.
Once fully mature an adult Weimaraner must be fed a good quality diet to ensure their continued good health. As a rough guide an adult Weimaraner can be fed the following amounts every day:
If you are looking to buy a Weimaraner you would need to pay anything from £400 to over £900 for a well-bred pedigree puppy. The cost of insuring a male 3-year-old Weimaraner in northern England would be £29.83 a month for basic cover but for a lifetime policy this would set you back £67.32 a month (quote as of September 2017). When insurance companies calculate a pet's premium they factor in several things which includes where you live in the UK a dog's age and whether they have been neutered or spayed among other things.
When it comes to food costs you need to buy the best quality food whether wet or dry making sure it suits the different stages of a dog’s life. This would set you back between £40 - £50 a month. On top of this you need to factor in veterinary costs if you want to share your home with a Weimaraner and this includes their initial vaccinations their annual boosters the cost of neutering or spaying a dog when the time is right and their yearly health checks all of which quickly adds up to over £1200 a year.
As a rough guide the average cost to keep and care for a Weimaraner would be between £80 to £120 a month depending on the level of insurance cover you opt to buy for your dog but this does not include the initial cost of buying a well-bred Kennel Club registered pedigree puppy.
When visiting and buying any puppy or dog there are many important things to consider and questions to ask of the breeder/seller. You can read our generic puppy/dog advice here which includes making sure you see the puppy with its mother and to verify that the dog has been wormed and microchipped.
Weimaraners are an extremely popular breed both in the UK and elsewhere in the world which means that well-bred puppies command a lot of money. As such with Weimaraners there is specific advice questions and protocols to follow when buying a puppy which are as follows:

​​Weimaraners are balls of large energy with friendly and bold personalities. They crave exercise and love to run, hike, or join you in any outdoor activity. They can become frustrated and destructive without an outlet for their boundless spirit. While friendly and eager to please, these silver dogs can also be stubborn and require consistent training.
Ideally suited for active families without small children, Weimaraners thrive on camaraderie with their trusted humans and are known for being loyal, fun-loving companions. Their intelligence and alertness also make them excellent watchdogs. However, their strong personalities and need for training might not be ideal for first-time dog owners.
Nicknamed the "Gray Ghost" for their signature coat color, the Weimaraner’s origin can be traced back to approximately 1810 when Grand Duke Karl August of Weimar was believed to have developed the breed by crossing German Pointers, French Hounds, and Bloodhounds. Weimaraners remained prized possessions in Germany for over a century and were brought to the U.S. just before World War II.
Active individuals with an adventurous spirit make ideal Weimaraner companions. Their playful personalities can be a source of endless amusement (and perhaps a little mischief), so a sense of humor will get you far as an owner too. These energetic dogs require ample time for exercise and training, so any stimulating activity that challenges their minds and bodies will be a welcome addition to their routine. Weimaraners thrive in homes with older children or adults-only environments where they can keep up with their high energy levels and where small children don’t divert attention.
Weimaraners are athletes with an exercise schedule to match. Daily walks are a must, but to truly thrive they require activities that challenge their seemingly endless energy. Think running, fetching, swimming, or agility training—anything that gets them moving freely and expending that steam. A tired Weimaraner is a happy Weimaraner, less likely to exhibit destructive behaviors out of boredom.
Weimaraners are large, energetic dogs who need a fenced-in yard in a suburban or rural area with plenty of space to zoom around and exhaust themselves.
While the dog’s energy might seem endless, its grooming needs are simple. The big grey dog’s short coat requires minimal brushing with a bristle brush or hound mitt to remove loose hair and maintain a healthy sheen. Regular nail trims are crucial to prevent discomfort and potential injury. Aim for a length that just avoids clicking on hard surfaces. While their coat repels dirt remarkably well, a Weimareaner’s adorably floppy ears require regular checks for moisture and potential infections.
Weimaraners are highly intelligent dogs, which can be a double-edged sword when it comes to training. They pick up commands quickly, but that applies to both desired and undesired behaviors. Consistent, positive reinforcement training is crucial to channel their intelligence.
They operate on a "what's in it for me?" basis, so get creative and make training sessions fun and rewarding. While some sources portray them as stubborn, their eagerness to please shines through with the right approach. Once engaged, Weimaraners thrive on mental challenges—agility training being a perfect example.
​​While Weimaraners are known for their friendly and playful personalities, their energy levels can overwhelm young children. These energetic pups are like furry bundles of joy, but their bouncing enthusiasm might translate to accidental bumps and excited play that's too rough for little ones. However, in a household with older children who can keep up with their playful spirit, Weimaraners can be fantastic companions. They'll happily join in on games of fetch and adventures in the park, forming a strong bond with their active family.
The cost of a Weimaraner from a breeder is significantly more than the cost of adopting one from a local shelter or rescue. The adoption fee usually covers additional items such as spaying or neutering, vaccines, and microchipping.

The Weimaraner is a large breed dog that is well-known for its distinctive short and sleek coat, traditionally in a shade of gray. It has an aristocratic bearing, a distinctive, intelligent gaze, and a muscular physique that hints at its endurance and power.

The breed originated in Germany in the early 19th century. The Weimaraner was developed at the court of the Grand Duke Karl August of Weimar, from whom it gets its name. These dogs were specifically bred to be the perfect hunting companion, capable of handling big game like deer and bear, though they also proved adept at hunting smaller animals such as birds and rabbits. By the late 19th century, the breed was well-established and recognized throughout Germany.

The Weimaraner made its way to the United States in the early 20th century, with the first Weimaraner arriving in the United States in the 1920s. The breed's popularity surged post-World War II, and it remains popular today as both a hunting companion and a family pet.
Weimaraners can suffer from degenerative myelopathy and progressive rod-cone degeneration. Some other common health problems in this breed include hip dysplasia, gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), and certain genetic disorders such as Von Willebrand's Disease and distichiasis. They may also be susceptible to hypomyelination and tremors, hyperuricosuria, and spinal dysraphism.
Weimaraners are known for their energy, intelligence, and strong desire to work. They are excellent hunting dogs, and they also excel in various dog sports. Weimaraners are very loyal and love spending time with their families. They can be a bit reserved with strangers, but they are generally good with children and other dogs.It's important to note that Weimaraners need plenty of exercise to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive. They also benefit from having a consistent routine and positive reinforcement training methods.
During the Cold War, Weimaraners were used by the US Air Force for scent-detection work.Weimaraners have webbed feet, which makes them excellent swimmers.Famous photographer William Wegman has used his own Weimaraners as subjects in his work, making the breed a favorite among the art community.A Weimaraner owned by President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived in the White House with the first family.
