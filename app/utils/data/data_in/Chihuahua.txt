Chihuahuas are not known as the most patient breed and may not react well to children, especially any boisterous play. This breed is known to be a little snappy and they tend to do best in quieter households without children. As with all dogs, any time your Chihuahua spends with children should be supervised to make sure everyone stays safe and happy.
Chihuahuas can swim but aren’t necessarily built to be great in the water. As Chihuahuas were bred as lapdogs, swimming isn’t something that comes instinctively. However, many Chihuahuas love the water although due to their small size they can get tired easily and should always be supervised.

Choosing the right insurance for your Chihuahua can help keep them happy and healthy whatever happens. When choosing insurance make sure you check carefully the range of conditions and types of treatment covered. Examine whether the full cost of diagnostics like MRI scans or CT scans is included. Look at any limits on the cost of individual treatments and whether dental illnesses and injuries are covered especially as we see Chihuahuas are prone to mouth and teeth issues. With Petplan’s Covered for Life® dog insurance we have no additional limits for specific conditions or diagnostic tools.

Chihuahua – Fast Facts
While Chihuahuas may top the list of world’s smallest dog breeds, when it comes to personality, these feisty, fun-sized dogs are anything but small! These little guys have no problem letting the world know their opinions, it's one of their most endearing qualities.
Often nicknamed “velcro dogs,” Chihuahuas are fiercely loyal to their owners and love nothing more than to be by their side. Often the poster child for the “purse dog,” it’s not uncommon to see Chihuahuas hanging out of handbags on city streets and sidewalk cafes. Their small size and ease of portability have made them one of the most popular city pets.
Chihuahuas are a lot of fun, but they can also be a challenge. Here’s an in-depth look at owning one of these pint-sized pups!
A breed with a complex and ancient past, the story of the Chihuahua began in Mexico sometime during the 9th century. It is believed they descended from the ancient Techichi, a now-extinct dog kept by nobles of the Aztec Empire. The likeness of these dogs has been found depicted in artifacts from many sites of ancient civilizations.
The modern Chihuahua we know and love today, began to take shape during the 19th century in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Thus, how the Chihuahua got its name. During the 20th century, as more people moved to big cities and lived in apartments, Chihuahuas skyrocketed in popularity as the perfect apartment pet.
At the turn of the 21st century, Chihuahuas reached their height of popularity as the breed was famously featured in movies like Legally Blonde and television commercials for the fast-food chain, Taco Bell. The breed was also commonly paraded around in purses by celebrities like Paris Hilton. This unfortunately also led to a surge in overbreeding and Chihuahuas ending up in shelters. In the early 2000s, animal advocacy groups worked tirelessly to educate the public on the plight of this special breed.
Today, the Chihuahua is still an immensely popular breed, beloved for its small stature, adorable looks, and feisty personality.

There are several unique attributes that help define the Chihuahua breed. Here’s what you can expect from a purebred Chihuahua.
Chihuahua size and appearance
Chihuahuas are generally regarded as the world’s smallest dogs. They are in a class known as toy breeds. Chihuahuas typically weigh just 3 to 6 pounds and stand between 5 and 8 inches tall. They come in a variety of colors with markings that can include bi-color and tri-color variations. Chihuahua coats can be either smooth (short) or long.
Key traits of a Chihuahua
Chihuahuas are loyal, feisty, and quick-witted dogs. They tend to cling to their owners but be wary of strangers and other dogs. They are also very vigilant and protective of their people and their space and can be quite vocal. Chihuahuas typically have no problem standing up for themselves, even if it means staring down a much larger dog or barking at a stranger on the street.
While some Chihuahuas that were socialized early or raised with other dogs will enjoy some canine company, overall, the breed is not particularly social. They like to be with their owners, preferably curled up in their lap!
Having a good training plan for your Chihuahua is important to help curb some of their bolder behaviors. Left untrained, some Chihuahuas can become anxious or destructive. Their protective instincts can also turn into resource guarding, reactivity, or excessive barking. Early training and socialization are key to a well-rounded Chihuahua!
Chihuahua health and lifespan
The Chihuahua is a generally healthy breed with an expected lifespan of 14 to 16 years, but some have been known to make it well into their 20s. They are one of the longest-lived dog breeds. However, like all purebred dogs, Chihuahuas can be predisposed to certain health conditions such as:
Due to their size, Chihuahuas can also have a hard time regulating their body temperature. They have a very low body mass and need extra care to keep warm, especially in colder climates. Their small stature also makes them fragile. Unfortunately, Chihuahuas have been known to sustain fractures just from jumping off furniture or engaging in play. Extra caution should be taken to help prevent injuries.
While not every Chihuahua will be impacted by one of these conditions, pet insurance is always a good thing to have to help with veterinary expenses. Especially in cases of accidents or emergencies. Protect your Chihuahua with a 24Petprotect Insurance Plan.

Like all dogs, Chihuahuas have special needs but overall, they are considered a fairly low-maintenance dog breed. They don’t take up much space or have strenuous exercise needs outside of regular walks and playtime. Chihuahuas are also known as one of the cleanest dog breeds. They don’t shed much or need much grooming apart from a weekly brushing (long-haired Chihuahuas may need slightly more) and a bath every 3 to 6 weeks.
Due to their size, fragility, and temperament, Chihuahuas are typically not recommended for homes with very young children or large, rambunctious dogs. They can, unfortunately, easily get injured during play or end up nipping at children and other dogs that don’t understand how to respect the Chihuahua’s boundaries. They tend to do better in calmer environments with adults or older children.
While the Chihuahua’s extra small size is one of its most endearing qualities, it can also present some unique challenges. Sadly, due to their popularity and portability, Chihuahuas are one of the most stolen dog breeds. They are also at an increased risk for attacks by wildlife like coyotes and hawks that may mistake Chihuahuas for prey due to their size.
To help keep your Chihuahua safe, never leave them unattended outside, consider purchasing a wildlife protection vest (these have outer spikes to prevent wildlife from picking up your Chihuahua) and get them microchipped. Adding a 24Petwatch Lifetime Protection Membership will also give you access to lost pet recovery specialists and the largest microchip data registry in North America should your Chihuahua go missing.
Chihuahuas make wonderful companions, but as with all dogs, this breed is not suited for everyone. Chihuahuas can be a challenge for certain lifestyles so it’s important to do your research before bringing one into your home. Here are the top things to consider if you’re thinking about owning a Chihuahua:
Ultimately, Chihuahuas are companion dogs, they love spending time with their owners and will do best in a household that allows that. If your lifestyle requires long hours away from home or a ton of travel, a Chihuahua might not be the best breed for you.

Are Chihuahuas good with children?
Chihuahuas can be good with children, given it’s in the right environment. Due to their fragility and temperament, Chihuahuas tend to do better with older children that can respect their boundaries and use caution when handling them to prevent injury. As with all dogs, interactions with children be supervised.
Are Chihuahuas good with other dogs?
While they are not the most social dogs, Chihuahuas can get along with other dogs with proper training and socialization. It’s also important that the other dogs are a good match for their size, energy, and temperament. Interactions with large, rambunctious dogs can lead to injury and should be avoided.
Can Chihuahuas be left alone for long periods?
While some Chihuahuas do better on their own than others, overall, this breed tends to be clingy and can easily develop separation anxiety. A good rule of thumb for most Chihuahuas is no more than 4 to 6 hours without at least a potty break. If you have a job that requires long hours away from home, consider a dog walker or dog daycare service for your Chihuahua.
Do Chihuahuas bark a lot?
Chihuahuas are a very vocal breed and quite vigilant of their surroundings. It’s not uncommon for them to bark at the sight of strangers or upon hearing an unusual sound. While training can help with excessive barking, many Chihuahuas will still bark frequently. They love to play the role of security alarm!
Why do Chihuahuas shake?
Due to their small size and low body mass, Chihuahuas can have trouble regulating their body temperature which translates into shivering and shaking. Most Chihuahua owners find that sweaters and blankets are a must for this breed, especially in colder climates.

Chihuahuas are a special breed, with lots of love, and of course, lots of sass, to give! A Chihuahua will be committed to you for life, just make sure you are ready to do the same before bringing one of these special little dogs into your home.

The Chihuahua is a balanced and graceful toy breed that should weigh no more than six pounds. It has a rounded apple-shaped head with erect pointy ears. It moves swiftly and has a temperament and behavior that’s similar to a Terrier. Its eyes are round and set somewhat far apart and can be light-colored or blue in some dogs. The nose can also change color in lighter coats, or it will be black. The tail is moderately long and shaped like a sickle.
The Chihuahua is an adaptable dog breed that is well suited to almost any environment. It enjoys indoor apartments as well as running around outside. They must be indoor dogs and are sometimes intimidated and frightened by larger animals. It can also stay frightened for a long time if yelled at or scolded, and it is extremely sensitive to cold.

You will find many high-quality breeders that can deliver you a healthy puppy. You can often find Chihuahuas in animal shelters at a much lower cost than that of a breeder.
You may also need to get your dog fixed and possibly microchipped, which can add to the cost of purchase. You’ll need to purchase food, treats, and toys, along with flea and tick medication.
Owners and breeders usually describe the Chihuahua as having the temperament and behavior of a Terrier. It’s extremely alert and watchful, making this breed an excellent watchdog despite its small size. They are very sensitive and easily upset if scolded or treated meanly by people or other animals, and it can take them a long time for them to forgive and forget. The Chihuahua is timid and needs plenty of early socialization to get used to people and other pets, as well as loud noises and other things that might scare or intimidate it.
The Chihuahua is an intelligent animal that is easy to train and learns quickly. They can become bored easily if not continuously mentally stimulated, and if that happens, they often misbehave and can even become destructive. This breed is easy to housetrain and is happiest in the company of others.
The Chihuahua is great for families that don’t have any children younger than eight years old. The reason you cannot keep small children or toddlers around this breed is that the Chihuahua is small and fragile. It can easily be hurt unintentionally by a child while playing. Children aside, this breed enjoys being part of the family and does not like to be left on its own. It enjoys large homes and is also much more suited to compact city apartments than most other breeds.
The Chihuahua can get along fine with other pets if they are socialized early. Not properly socializing them will cause them to be more cautious around strange animals, except for other dogs of the same breed. However, in most cases, after a short introductory period, the Chihuahua will take to making friends unless the other party is aggressive during the introductory period. Many professional owners and breeders highly recommend doggy kindergarten and obedience classes to help with many of the issues dealing with socialization.
Here is a short list of things you should consider before you purchase a Chihuahua.
Since the Chihuahua is such a small dog, the food cost when compared to other breeds is minimal. In many cases, a cat will eat more food. Exactly how much food the dog requires will depend on its size as well as its age. Well-balanced dry dog food is usually the best option, but it’s very sensitive to chemicals, including artificial colors and preservatives. We recommend choosing a food that has lean meat, like chicken, lamb, turkey, or beef listed as its first ingredient. We also recommend foods fortified with antioxidants, probiotics, and omega fatty acids. Once you have found the brand you want, follow the directions on the package for feeding. Usually, a full-grown Chihuahua will eat between ¼ and ½-cup of food per day spread out over two or three meals.
While most veterinarians recommend high-quality dry kibble as the main food source for your pet, it can be a great idea to home-cook your dog treats. Home-cooked treats will not have the questionable ingredients that can lead to weight gain or allergic reactions found in many store-bought treats. If you are interested in cooking home-cooked treats for your pet, we recommend picking up a dog treat cookbook so that you have plenty of options to work with, as many Chihuahua are finicky eaters.
The Chihuahua is an amazingly active dog for its size, and it refuses to give up or stop to take a break. You will need to be the one to stop and take a break, or the dog will run until it drops, which can cause hyperventilating and other issues. In most cases, running around after you in your home will usually provide enough exercise for this breed, but you may opt for a short walk if they seem too rambunctious in the home after hours.
With plenty of patience and enthusiasm, the Chihuahua is easy to train. While training, it’s important to stay consistent. Doing the same routine each day will help lock the training into the pet’s long-term memory where it will remain. Training occasionally or inconsistently will be much less effective. It will take considerably longer for your pet to follow commands, and you may never achieve the desired results.
Using treats and a lot of praise is the best and fastest way to teach your pet a new trick. Once they see they are making you happy, they will work very hard to follow your commands. After they start getting the nack for the command, you can begin to phase out the treats to prevent weight gain.
A Chihuahua is available in a short coat or a long coat. Each coat requires a moderate amount of grooming. The short hair coat will require brushing at least once a week that includes the underside of the body as well as the legs. The long hair coats will require brushing at least three times a week and tend to develop tangles that need constant attention and may require trimming. You may be able to prevent tangles by brushing first and then combing through with a detangling product.
Purebred dogs like the Chihuahua are more prone to genetic disorders than many mixed breeds because breeders can selectively breed out known problems. While the Chihuahua has a long lifespan, there are several health problems that we will discuss in this section.
The Major Conditions can be life-threatening or something less serious that occurs commonly.
Luxating Patella
Luxating patella is a dislocated kneecap that occurs more and more as the dog ages. If your Chihuahua has this condition, you may notice a limp, or the dog may try to avoid using the leg at all. It may also hold the leg in the air, which can help ease the joint back into place. The dog does not seem to suffer from too much pain with this condition, and in extreme cases, surgery may help.
Hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia is a term used to describe low blood sugar. If your pet seems weak or disoriented, it can be a sign of hypoglycemia. It may also seem tired and might even lose consciousness in some cases. Hypoglycemia can be a sign of a more serious disease like diabetes or liver disease, so it’s important to take your dog to the vet immediately if you notice these symptoms. It’s best to make sure you don’t miss any meals if your pet is prone to hypoglycemia.
Tracheal Collapse
Tracheal collapse is a condition that tightens the windpipe of your Chihuahua, causing difficulty breathing, usually accompanied by a honking cough. If too much air gets blocked, you may notice their gums turn blue, and they are at risk for fainting. A collapsed trachea is fairly common, and if you can get them to the vet quickly, they can often repair the condition and give a good prognosis. You may also need to follow up with cough suppressants or steroids.
Minor conditions are those that rarely occur or present little danger to your pet’s health.
Tooth and Gum Disease
Many small breeds like the Chihuahua are predisposed to overcrowded teeth. These crowded teeth can be extremely hard to clean, which can result in the plaque and tartar build-up that causes tooth decay and gum disease. Making sure to be vigilant about brushing your pet’s teeth every day along with a supply of teeth cleaning dental chews can help reduce the amount of food trapped in the teeth keeping the gums healthier.
Hydrocephalus
The Molera is the soft spot on a Chihuahuas head very similar to the soft spot found on a baby’s head when it’s born. If the soft spot on your Chihuahuas head is larger than usual, spinal fluid can surround the brain and result in the condition known as Hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can cause numerous neurological disorders and may also cause seizures and a swollen head. While there is no treatment for this disorder, many dogs can continue to live a full life.
There is very little difference between the male and the female once you get them fixed. However, there are quite a few differences between them otherwise. The males tend to have a dominant personality and will often try to rule the house and everyone in it. They often mark their territory inside and outside of the home. They are also prone to running off, which can be dangerous because they are easy prey to many predators. Male Chihuahuas are also known for humping anything it can find.
Unfixed, the female Chihuahua is much more tolerable, but she’s known for dramatic and sudden mood swings. The female may also become withdrawn, but these symptoms tend to come and go along with her heat cycle.
The Chihuahua is an excellent pet for anyone that lives in cramped quarters or a city. It’s an extremely energetic dog, but you can often burn up the energy by playing games right in the home. These dogs aren’t advised for anyone with small children because they are very fragile and easily hurt. Early socialization is best for large families or families with other pets.
We hope that you have enjoyed this quick look at the world’s smallest dog and have decided to look into purchasing one for your home.

This Chihuahua breed profile has everything you need to know about this toy-size pooch.
The Chihuahua breed is a popular choice if you're looking for a toy-size breed. While they might be small in size, they are big in personality and aren't afraid to let you know just how they feel.
Chihuahuas can grow to around six to nine inches tall (15-23cm) and anywhere between four to six pounds (1.8- 2.7 kg) when they're fully grown. This pocket-sized breed comes in both short and long coats and can be seen in a variety of colors including chocolate, gold, white, tan, and many others. They are one of the longest-living dog breeds and can live well into their teenage years, which is great news if you're looking for one of the best dog breeds for companionship.
Contrary to many stereotypes this is not an aggressive pup and with the right training and socialization practice, this pup can easily and happily live with a family. This breed loves spending time with their loved ones and playing around with some of the best dog toys.
We spoke with vet, Dr. Rebecca MacMillan to find out everything there is to know about this adorable toy dog breed. Let's get into it!


Often referred to as 'purse-dogs' these tiny pups often spend a good amount of time with their owners as they are so easy to carry around. This makes chihuahuas one of the dog breeds most likely to suffer from separation anxiety. So knowing how to reduce separation anxiety in dogs is vital with this breed.
Also, contrary to stereotypes, this is not a naturally aggressive dog. Dr. MacMillan notes that several factors can lead to aggressive behaviors as with any breed. Due to their small size, many pet parents overlook basic training and socialization training, but it is super important just as it is with large-breed dogs. Given the right training and socialization practice, this breed will better adapt to family environments and home living.
Due to their compact size, these pups are perfect lap pets and ideal for pet parents with limited space in their homes. They will be perfectly happy running around apartments chasing after their favorite toys, or strolls around the neighborhood.

This stuffable chew toy is perfect for pooches who are looking to get their teeth into something. It is super durable and you put their favorite treats inside for an extra challenge.
Are those adorable pups good for families? Yes! But here are some things to take into consideration. As they are small pups, it is important that they are handled properly. Which can be a tricky thing to teach young children, so they may be better suited to homes with older children.
Dr. MacMillan also says, "Chihuahuas are relatively fragile compared to many other breeds of dog so injury could occur if they are not handled carefully. They also need their personal space which young children may unwittingly invade."
Like any other breed, chihuahuas can become irritable or threatened if they feel their personal space is being invaded. This can lead aggressive behaviors such as growling and biting.
Dr. MacMillan also notes that if your home is filled with hustle and bustle you should take extra care of chihuahuas running around. "Busy households need to make sure that these tiny dogs don’t accidentally get stood on, dropped, or fall from high places like sofas or beds. I have seen many small dogs, including Chihuahuas, with fractured limbs because of mistakes like these. Their ideal home isn’t too hectic, they appreciate their own space and will form close bonds with their owners."
Chihuahuas are loyal to a fault. This can make them wary to unfamiliar visitors. They also appreciate their regular routines and may become unsettled with frequent changes in routines and their home environments.

Luckily, if you are a busy pet parent you won't need to spend hours making sure your pooch gets all the exercise they need each day. They have minimal exercise requirements. Dr. MacMillan says, "Around 30 – 60 minutes per day is required, depending on their age and health. Chihuahuas will also enjoy plenty of play and social interaction between walks."
A high-quality diet of the best dog food will be enough to satisfy these tiny pups. "Due to their tiny size, you will find it won’t cost you too much to feed them the best quality food, compared to a big dog who would need to eat comparatively more," adds Dr. MacMillan.

There are certain conditions that chihuahua owners should be aware of. This breed can be prone to dental disease and a condition called luxating patellas. This condition causes the kneecaps to slip in and out of position resulting in limping. If you notice anything different regarding your pup's mobility we recommend making an appointment with your vet right away.
Dr. MacMillan notes pet parents should be aware of another condition. She says, "Hydrocephalus is a serious condition that can unfortunately be seen in Chihuahuas. It is a build-up of fluid around the brain that can cause an enlarged head, bulging eyes, seizures, and loss of coordination amongst other signs. They can be born with it, or they can develop it a bit later in life so you should keep an eye out for the signs."

There are several reasons for Chihuahuas tremble.  Chihuahuas typically tremble when they’re excited or anxious. Trembling can also be a sign of various health conditions, including low blood sugar or allergies. If you’re worried about your pet, it’s best to seek an opinion from your vet.
Chihuahuas are considered to be light to moderate shedders, whether they are of a long or short haired variety. There’s nothing you can do to stop shedding, but brushing your dog regularly will help to remove some of that loose hair and keep your Chihuahua’s coat in tip top condition!
When it comes to learning tricks, Chihuahuas are not considered the quickest learners. However, their independent streak means that they are clever when it comes to learning how to do things for themselves. When training a Chihuahua, patience is key – as soon as your pet realises what’s in it for them, they’ll quickly respond!
Chihuahuas are not known as the most patient breed and may not react well to children, especially any boisterous play. This breed is known to be a little snappy and they tend to do best in quieter households without children. As with all dogs, any time your Chihuahua spends with children should be supervised to make sure everyone stays safe and happy.
Chihuahuas can swim but aren’t necessarily built to be great in the water. As Chihuahuas were bred as lapdogs, swimming isn’t something that comes instinctively. However, many Chihuahuas love the water although due to their small size they can get tired easily and should always be supervised. A Chihuahuas small stature also means they can easily come overwhelmed when faced with large expanses of water, so if your pet is a swimmer it’s best to stick to smaller ponds and pools.
Feisty and independent, Chihuahuas are easily provoked and very vocal. A big dog in a small dog’s body, the Chihuahua is quick to make their unhappiness known and will become vocal and snappy if they feel the need. It’s important to remember that for this diminutive breed, anti-social behaviours are usually triggered by your Chihuahua feeling threatened or afraid so early socialisation and plenty of regular exposure to other dogs and people is crucial for nurturing a well-rounded and confident pet.

Choosing the right insurance for your Chihuahua can help keep them happy and healthy whatever happens. When choosing insurance make sure you check carefully the range of conditions and types of treatment covered. Examine whether the full cost of diagnostics like MRI scans or CT scans is included. Look at any limits on the cost of individual treatments and whether dental illnesses and injuries are covered especially as we see Chihuahuas are prone to mouth and teeth issues. With Petplan’s Covered for Life® dog insurance we have no additional limits for specific conditions or diagnostic tools.

If there was ever a creature that proves size doesn’t matter, it is the diminutive Chihuahua. These pint-sized canines are a walking contradiction. They’re a trembling, quivering mess one minute, launching a full-scale attack at visitors the next. They are one of the most loving, affectionate, and cuddly dogs on the planet but also one of the breeds most likely to bite your fingers and ankles. So, which is it? Fierce warrior or frightened weakling? Most Chihuahua dog owners will agree that it is both.
We’re going to embark on a journey to learn all there is to know about the Chihuahua, including where they came from, what makes them tick, and why you should not judge them by their tiny size.
Height:
5–8 inches
Weight:
Under 6 pounds
Lifespan:
14–16 years
Colors:
Black, black & tan, blue & tan, chocolate, chocolate & tan, cream, fawn, fawn & white, red
Suitable for:
Families with older children, apartments, people who want a constant companion
Temperament:
Protective, playful, loving, yappy.
In their myriad colors, the Chihuahua can be either short-haired (smooth coat) or long-haired, but the smooth coat is the more commonly kept of the two. These “handbag dogs” experienced a surge of popularity in the mid-20th century, appearing under the arms of major celebrities such as Billie Holiday, Mickey Rourke, Paris Hilton, Cesar Millan, and Madonna. Their portability and cuddly nature make them the ideal companion for frequent travelers. However, there is even more to love about these tiny but fierce dogs.
If you think a Chihuahua dog is tiny, wait until you see their puppies! At 3–4 weeks old, the average Chihuahua puppy weighs around the same as a can of beans (15 ounces) and will be around 30–50 ounces by the time they’re 4 months old. Because of that, many breeders will hold onto pups until they are around 12–14 weeks old before letting them go to their new homes so that they are a little more resilient. Vaccinations and microchipping are often done a bit later due to their tiny size.
It is common for Chihuahua puppies to have delayed closing of the growth plates in the skull, resulting in open fontanelles, which is the same as the “soft spot” often found on the back of a baby’s head. In most breeds, these fontanelles close between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks, but it is quite common for them to persist beyond 12 weeks in the Chihuahua. Some apple-head dogs can have fontanelles that never fully close, which are called moleras.
Like almost everything else about the Chihuahua, the size of their litters tends to be pretty small. They give birth to one to three puppies, on average, sometimes more. The apple-head Chihuahuas have a higher incidence of dystocia (birthing difficulties) due to the size of the puppy’s head compared to the mother’s pelvis. Despite these factors, Chihuahua pups are relatively easy to come by, likely because breeders can easily make space to have more than one litter at a time.

Although the Mexican state of Chihuahua is generally regarded as their native land, some believe that the Chihuahua may have been introduced from Malta or even China. Early depictions are of a rather rotund version of the dog we know today, known as the Techichi, which was most likely bred as a source of food rather than companionship.
In the 11th Century, when the Aztecs conquered the Toltec people, the dogs became more than just dinner and started to feature in religious traditions. It is believed that the Chihuahua was created by breeding the Techichi with the Xoloitzcuintli (Mexican Hairless Dog) to produce a dog with more refined features, which gained popularity as a companion for nobility. Historians also believe some people sacrificed Chihuahuas to accompany the bodies of deceased nobles to guide them through the afterlife.1
Unlike most breeds, the Chihuahua was not bred for a specific role other than companionship, which is a vital part of understanding their nature. The breed we know today started to gain the attention of North Americans in the mid-1800s and was officially recognized as an AKC breed in 1908.2

Since they were developed to be companions rather than workers, the Chihuahua’s personality and temperament tend to be an exciting blend of helpless, devoted, protective, anxious, confident, playful, and mischievous. While their bodies may be small, their personalities are enormous, and there are a few characteristics they are known for, such as their “bitey behavior,” which most likely stems from their small stature, as well as their almost constant quivering, which could be due to many reasons, such as being cold, low blood sugar, and anatomy issues.
Chihuahuas prefer to be part of a group, whether dogs or humans. Because they are so tiny, they may not be the ideal pet for younger kids who might be a bit too playful, but because they enjoy playing as much as snuggling, they are the ideal companion for families who are looking for a compact canine that will enjoy fun and games just as much as they love cuddling up on a lap.
The Chihuahua wasn’t bred for work; they were bred for love. This impacts their behavior because they don’t have an underlying drive or urge to seek out other activities like other breeds. They weren’t bred to hunt rats, herd sheep, or retrieve birds; they were bred to love and be loved and are not easily distracted from that particular path! Although it’s not unusual for a Chihuahua to become particularly attached to a single person, they are generous with their affection and happy to cuddle up to the nearest warm body.
In addition to enjoying the company of humans, Chihuahuas also like to be part of a pack and feel more secure when surrounded by other canines. It’s common for the smallest dog in the house to take over the leadership of a group of dogs, which is partly due to their assertive nature and partly a survival mechanism. Being tiny and submissive can put them at risk of being bullied, missing out on food, or being squeezed out of the action.
Care needs to be taken when introducing a Chihuahua to new dogs since they can be accidentally injured, but it is also important to allow them to meet each other properly and establish boundaries. You would be surprised how gentle a large dog can be once they learn how to treat their tiny friend.
Chihuahuas enjoy a game of chase, and cats that are likely to run away can become targets of relentless pursuit. However, if you have cats that are used to the company of dogs, a Chihuahua can tolerate them. However, we recommend trimming your cat’s claws as a precaution to keep those bulging Chihuahua eyes safe.

Most Chihuahuas only need to eat around half a cup of dry food or 6–10 ounces of wet food per day. It might not seem like much, but when you consider the size of their stomachs, it’s plenty. Chihuahuas have reputations for being picky eaters, while others know them to be very greedy. Being so small, it’s not uncommon for a Chihuahua to skip a meal here or there, but if you offer them something extra tasty when they miss a meal, they’ll remember your generosity and may expect it in the future.
Feeding them wet and dry food is okay, but it’s best to find a brand with smaller pieces if you use dry food.
Chihuahuas love to run, play, sleep, and relax. They are ideal for people in smaller homes or apartments, and their exercise needs can be met with a short, daily walk. However, they’re notorious for despising bad weather and prefer playing indoors rather than getting soaked in the rain.
In the same way that the exercise needs or dental care of Chihuahuas can sometimes get overlooked because of their tiny stature, training can sometimes be seen as an optional activity, which is definitely not the case. Training and socialization are just as crucial for the Chihuahua as for a Pit Bull, but their size can make it more challenging.
Some Chihuahuas have three settings: eating, sleeping, and up to something, especially when you have more than one! They love to chew, bite, and play with things, and silence should always be treated with suspicion. Indoor accidents are easy to miss, so you may miss the opportunity to interrupt them from going potty indoors and moving them outside.
Using a crate can be useful when toilet training a Chihuahua, but you must use a fairly small crate. If the crate is too roomy, the dog may use one corner as a toilet! Ideally, the crate should be the size of their bed and include space for a small water bowl.
When it comes to grooming, the Chihuahua dog is a pretty low-maintenance canine. Even the longer coats need little more than a daily brushing and perhaps a quick swipe of a cleaning wipe. However, they need regular nail trims, so get them used to having their toes played with from day one.
Chihuahuas are prone to tear staining (more on that later), so it’s a good idea to get them used to having their eyes examined and wiped with an eye cleaner as part of their daily routine. Using a lubricating gel is a great way to keep their eyes comfortable.
The average Chihuahua lifespan is 12-14 years, making it one of the longest-lived breeds, and this is largely due, once again, to their size! Although the internal organs scale down relative to the dog’s size, their hearts don’t have to work as hard to keep blood circulating around their little bodies, which is why Chihuahuas with heart disease will often survive longer than other breeds. Despite that, there are a number of health issues that the Chihuahuas are predisposed to.
There isn’t a significant difference between the male and female Chihuahua; even a fully mature male isn’t significantly larger than the female. Although there will always be individual variations, male Chihuahuas are more assertive and affectionate, while females can be slightly more reserved.
We’re not talking about digging holes in the garden but about beds and blankets. Chihuahuas are like heat-seeking devices when it comes to finding the warmest, most comfortable spot in the house, which might be in bed with you, in your laundry pile, or in the linen cupboard.
As we mentioned above, Chihuahuas will seek out warmth, and they’ll be even happier if you can provide something extra! A hot water bottle, a warming bed, or a spot in the sun will satisfy them, and don’t be surprised to find yours has snuck into your bed to snuggle behind your knees.
While most of a Chihuahua’s day is spent sleeping, napping, and relaxing, they eventually need to burn off some energy! Most Chihuahuas love to play and will start doing laps around your home at a mile a minute until their little legs can’t go any further.
Chihuahuas are feisty, affectionate, devoted, and mischievous dogs that are so much more than their “land shark” reputation lets on. Like any breed, intense selective breeding has led to exaggerated physical traits in some individuals that can make them susceptible to several health concerns, but they also have one of the longest life expectancies of all breeds.
If you want a loving companion that requires minimal space, is relatively low maintenance, and demands very little from you apart from warmth and affection, you might want to consider welcoming a Chihuahua into your life. Their quirky personalities have been known to win over the most dedicated large-dog devotees, and with the proper healthcare, nutrition, and love, these tiny canines can bring you several years of joy.

The Chihuahua is a balanced and graceful toy breed that should weigh no more than six pounds. It has a rounded apple-shaped head with erect pointy ears. It moves swiftly and has a temperament and behavior that’s similar to a Terrier. Its eyes are round and set somewhat far apart and can be light-colored or blue in some dogs. The nose can also change color in lighter coats, or it will be black. The tail is moderately long and shaped like a sickle.
The Chihuahua is an adaptable dog breed that is well suited to almost any environment. It enjoys indoor apartments as well as running around outside. They must be indoor dogs and are sometimes intimidated and frightened by larger animals. It can also stay frightened for a long time if yelled at or scolded, and it is extremely sensitive to cold.

You will find many high-quality breeders that can deliver you a healthy puppy. You can often find Chihuahuas in animal shelters at a much lower cost than that of a breeder.
You may also need to get your dog fixed and possibly microchipped, which can add to the cost of purchase. You’ll need to purchase food, treats, and toys, along with flea and tick medication.
Owners and breeders usually describe the Chihuahua as having the temperament and behavior of a Terrier. It’s extremely alert and watchful, making this breed an excellent watchdog despite its small size. They are very sensitive and easily upset if scolded or treated meanly by people or other animals, and it can take them a long time for them to forgive and forget. The Chihuahua is timid and needs plenty of early socialization to get used to people and other pets, as well as loud noises and other things that might scare or intimidate it.
The Chihuahua is an intelligent animal that is easy to train and learns quickly. They can become bored easily if not continuously mentally stimulated, and if that happens, they often misbehave and can even become destructive. This breed is easy to housetrain and is happiest in the company of others.
The Chihuahua is great for families that don’t have any children younger than eight years old. The reason you cannot keep small children or toddlers around this breed is that the Chihuahua is small and fragile. It can easily be hurt unintentionally by a child while playing. Children aside, this breed enjoys being part of the family and does not like to be left on its own. It enjoys large homes and is also much more suited to compact city apartments than most other breeds.
The Chihuahua can get along fine with other pets if they are socialized early. Not properly socializing them will cause them to be more cautious around strange animals, except for other dogs of the same breed. However, in most cases, after a short introductory period, the Chihuahua will take to making friends unless the other party is aggressive during the introductory period. Many professional owners and breeders highly recommend doggy kindergarten and obedience classes to help with many of the issues dealing with socialization.
Here is a short list of things you should consider before you purchase a Chihuahua.
Since the Chihuahua is such a small dog, the food cost when compared to other breeds is minimal. In many cases, a cat will eat more food. Exactly how much food the dog requires will depend on its size as well as its age. Well-balanced dry dog food is usually the best option, but it’s very sensitive to chemicals, including artificial colors and preservatives. We recommend choosing a food that has lean meat, like chicken, lamb, turkey, or beef listed as its first ingredient. We also recommend foods fortified with antioxidants, probiotics, and omega fatty acids. Once you have found the brand you want, follow the directions on the package for feeding. Usually, a full-grown Chihuahua will eat between ¼ and ½-cup of food per day spread out over two or three meals.
While most veterinarians recommend high-quality dry kibble as the main food source for your pet, it can be a great idea to home-cook your dog treats. Home-cooked treats will not have the questionable ingredients that can lead to weight gain or allergic reactions found in many store-bought treats. If you are interested in cooking home-cooked treats for your pet, we recommend picking up a dog treat cookbook so that you have plenty of options to work with, as many Chihuahua are finicky eaters.
The Chihuahua is an amazingly active dog for its size, and it refuses to give up or stop to take a break. You will need to be the one to stop and take a break, or the dog will run until it drops, which can cause hyperventilating and other issues. In most cases, running around after you in your home will usually provide enough exercise for this breed, but you may opt for a short walk if they seem too rambunctious in the home after hours.
With plenty of patience and enthusiasm, the Chihuahua is easy to train. While training, it’s important to stay consistent. Doing the same routine each day will help lock the training into the pet’s long-term memory where it will remain. Training occasionally or inconsistently will be much less effective. It will take considerably longer for your pet to follow commands, and you may never achieve the desired results.
Using treats and a lot of praise is the best and fastest way to teach your pet a new trick. Once they see they are making you happy, they will work very hard to follow your commands. After they start getting the nack for the command, you can begin to phase out the treats to prevent weight gain.
A Chihuahua is available in a short coat or a long coat. Each coat requires a moderate amount of grooming. The short hair coat will require brushing at least once a week that includes the underside of the body as well as the legs. The long hair coats will require brushing at least three times a week and tend to develop tangles that need constant attention and may require trimming. You may be able to prevent tangles by brushing first and then combing through with a detangling product.
Purebred dogs like the Chihuahua are more prone to genetic disorders than many mixed breeds because breeders can selectively breed out known problems. While the Chihuahua has a long lifespan, there are several health problems that we will discuss in this section.
The Major Conditions can be life-threatening or something less serious that occurs commonly.
Luxating Patella
Luxating patella is a dislocated kneecap that occurs more and more as the dog ages. If your Chihuahua has this condition, you may notice a limp, or the dog may try to avoid using the leg at all. It may also hold the leg in the air, which can help ease the joint back into place. The dog does not seem to suffer from too much pain with this condition, and in extreme cases, surgery may help.
Hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia is a term used to describe low blood sugar. If your pet seems weak or disoriented, it can be a sign of hypoglycemia. It may also seem tired and might even lose consciousness in some cases. Hypoglycemia can be a sign of a more serious disease like diabetes or liver disease, so it’s important to take your dog to the vet immediately if you notice these symptoms. It’s best to make sure you don’t miss any meals if your pet is prone to hypoglycemia.
Tracheal Collapse
Tracheal collapse is a condition that tightens the windpipe of your Chihuahua, causing difficulty breathing, usually accompanied by a honking cough. If too much air gets blocked, you may notice their gums turn blue, and they are at risk for fainting. A collapsed trachea is fairly common, and if you can get them to the vet quickly, they can often repair the condition and give a good prognosis. You may also need to follow up with cough suppressants or steroids.
Minor conditions are those that rarely occur or present little danger to your pet’s health.
Tooth and Gum Disease
Many small breeds like the Chihuahua are predisposed to overcrowded teeth. These crowded teeth can be extremely hard to clean, which can result in the plaque and tartar build-up that causes tooth decay and gum disease. Making sure to be vigilant about brushing your pet’s teeth every day along with a supply of teeth cleaning dental chews can help reduce the amount of food trapped in the teeth keeping the gums healthier.
Hydrocephalus
The Molera is the soft spot on a Chihuahuas head very similar to the soft spot found on a baby’s head when it’s born. If the soft spot on your Chihuahuas head is larger than usual, spinal fluid can surround the brain and result in the condition known as Hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can cause numerous neurological disorders and may also cause seizures and a swollen head. While there is no treatment for this disorder, many dogs can continue to live a full life.
There is very little difference between the male and the female once you get them fixed. However, there are quite a few differences between them otherwise. The males tend to have a dominant personality and will often try to rule the house and everyone in it. They often mark their territory inside and outside of the home. They are also prone to running off, which can be dangerous because they are easy prey to many predators. Male Chihuahuas are also known for humping anything it can find.
Unfixed, the female Chihuahua is much more tolerable, but she’s known for dramatic and sudden mood swings. The female may also become withdrawn, but these symptoms tend to come and go along with her heat cycle.
The Chihuahua is an excellent pet for anyone that lives in cramped quarters or a city. It’s an extremely energetic dog, but you can often burn up the energy by playing games right in the home. These dogs aren’t advised for anyone with small children because they are very fragile and easily hurt. Early socialization is best for large families or families with other pets.
We hope that you have enjoyed this quick look at the world’s smallest dog and have decided to look into purchasing one for your home.

Famously small, Chihuahuas have a truly colossal personality. Classified as a toy breed, these pint-sized pups are chock-full of confidence and attitude. In fact, they'll likely hold their own amongst dogs ten times their size. To the ones they love, Chihuahuas have a reputation for being intensely loyal, protective, and sweet dogs.
Although these little bruisers aren't for everyone, Chihuahuas can make excellent companions. If you're looking for love in miniature form, the Chihuahua might be the right dog for you.
Table of contents
Also Known As.. Chi, Chi-chi, Chi-ken nugget, Mr. Big, hell-raiser, ankle-biter, "That's the biggest little dog I've ever seen!"
Chihuahuas are one of the oldest dog breeds in the world. Mexico's national symbol originated in Chihuahua, their largest state. Mexicans started selling these pups to American tourists in the late 1800s when they crossed the border from Texas. It was during these exchanges that the dog picked up the name of its home state.
It's speculated that Chihuahuas are the descendants of the ancient dog, Techichi. These thin-framed companion dogs roamed pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations. Archaeologists have also discovered figurines of these dogs, which illustrate the similar characteristics they share with the modern day Chihuahua.
Later, during the period of the Mayans (1800 BC to 900 AD) these 10–20 pound canines were often found buried with their humans. The Aztecs (1200s BC) may have had a cold reputation, but they adored teeny tiny dogs, and so selectively bred the Techichi to create the modern pocket-sized Chis.
Some historians postulate that Chihuahuas were created through the breeding of Techichi dogs and Chinese crested dogs, which generally weigh in at around 10 pounds. Others argue that they're of European descent. Still, new DNA evidence supports the theory that Chihuahuas are solely the great-great-great (great) grandchildren of ancient Mexican dogs. Regardless of where the tiny titans originated, they can be found all over the world today as our companions.

Height: 5–8 inches tall

Weight: Generally not exceeding six pounds.


Chihuahuas are one of the longest-living dog breeds with an average life expectancy of 14–16 years.

As Genie once said, "Phenomenal cosmic powers!... Itty bitty living space." That's a Chi in a nutshell (figuratively—they're small, but not lamp small).
Chihuahuas don't receive a lot of recognition for their gentle natures, but perhaps they should! This breed grew in popularity during the early 1900s, partially due to their sweet dispositions and adoration of their humans. Still, their impressive "big dog" personalities get a lot of attention for obvious reasons. Chihuahuas are clever dogs that will rule your home (and your neighborhood) in the absence of other leadership.
They're are also known to be highly devoted to just one or two people in their families. Even though they're less likely to be a friend to everyone they meet, they're still often fun-loving and entertaining. Plus, Chihuahuas make excellent alarm systems.

They'll likely yap at any potential intruder—be it the mailman, the neighbor's cat, or a squirrel. When you're that small, you have to make a big impression somehow!


Depending on the athleticism and physical capabilities of each individual dog, Chihuahuas may benefit from a slow daily trot to the park. Others may enjoy two short, brisk walks per day. The majority of Chis enjoy running, playing, and chasing toys in a small, confined space.

But keep in mind that, with this breed, there is a risk of overexertion. If a Chihuahua starts to pant, lies down, or is struggling to keep up, it's time to scoop her up and carry her home.

One of the many enjoyable aspects of living with a Chihuahua is watching them boldly prance around the room, greeting any familiar person who arrives. They're generally wary or even standoffish with strangers on the street, but can be socialized to be more accepting.
Chihuahuas are too delicate to deal with roughhousing from young children (not that any dog should have to deal with roughhousing). They also might growl, snap, or bite when they feel threatened by kids. As they're far more susceptible to injury due to their small stature, it's best to have Chihuahuas around older, well-behaved children.
That said, around responsible and calm kids, Chihuahuas can be wonderful dogs. They often like playing fetch, cuddling on the couch, and taking a stroll around the block. Just watch where you step when you share a home with them!
While some Chihuahuas can become over-sheltered and develop low self-esteem or fear, they're typically friendly with other dogs and cats. That stated, low confidence—as well as overprotectiveness and dominance—can all manifest as reactivity. Like all dogs, this breed needs to be socialized and trained before visiting the dog park or rooming with a cat.
It's also important to keep Chihuahuas' safety in mind around other animals at all times. Extra small or meek-mannered Chihuahuas are especially vulnerable to attack.
Due to the Chihuahua's excessively small size, it's important to keep in mind the threat of bad weather and predators. Special care must be taken when the temperature drops in the winter, as Chihuahuas have thin coats and low body fat.
Furthermore, these small dogs are so tiny that they're vulnerable to wildlife. If you're in an area where birds of prey, coyotes, or raccoons may be present, always keep your Chihuahua on a leash directly next to you, and never leave them unattended in a yard.
Don't let the small noggin fool you—alert and vivacious, Chihuahuas are highly trainable. Despite their intimidating attitudes, Chihuahuas are often eager to please their human companions. With positive and clear training practices, most Chihuahuas learn a variety of tasks and behaviors quickly. They'll also likely excel in obedience classes, as long as they're not overwhelmed by much larger, over-excited dogs.
Chihuahuas do need a strong leader (that's you!). When they're itty-bitty puppies, people can make the mistake of letting Chihuahuas do want they want. Every dog deserves to be well socialized and trained so they can exist peacefully with others. Without direction and guidance, Chis are liable to take over your home and rule with a feisty, furry fist.
This breed is generally healthy. Over the decades, though, as Chihuahuas have been bred to become smaller and smaller, some medical problems have arisen. If you plan on acquiring a Chihuahua from a reputable breeder, it's important to screen for common health issues, which include heart problems, eye disease, patellar luxation, and epilepsy.
Pay special attention to treats when it comes to a dog this small—the calories add up quickly when you're only 6 pounds. Chihuahuas are more prone to obesity than other breeds due to their pint-sized proportions. On top of regular daily exercise, this dog should receive a high quality, balanced diet (with treats being no more than 10% of their daily caloric intake).
Chihuahuas are also at higher risk for dental disease1, since their small mouths mean the teeth are more crowded than in larger breeds. It's essential that they receive routine teeth-brushings and yearly professional dental cleanings to avoid infection in the mouth. If infection occurs as a result of advanced dental disease, bacteria can spread to the heart and other body systems.
When choosing a responsible breeder, you'll also want to stay away from buzzwords like "teacup" or "miniature." These often indicate Chihuahuas that have been bred down to become even smaller, disregarding the health issues that occur as a result.
Given that these variations in breed aren't recognized by any official dog breed organizations, it's also likely that breeders are simply charging more money for the same type of dog. The only recognized differentiations in Chihuahuas are variations in their coat (smooth-coat or long-haired) and the shape of their head ("deer head" or the rounded "apple head").
Chihuahuas come in two different coat varieties: smooth-coat or long-haired. The smooth-coat Chihuahua needs very minimal brushing to keep them looking dapper. Long-haired Chihuahuas require more maintenance. Try to brush them at least once a week to avoid any mats or tangles forming.
While this breed usually keeps itself pretty clean, occasional bathing will also help them continue looking their best.


Exact cost is difficult to determine, but at a minimum, expect to spend around $500+ per year.

Aside from the cost to acquire the dog itself, Chihuahuas are medium-to-large size dogs that eat anywhere from 1/2–1+ cups of food per day. Expect a quality bag of food to cost around $20–$60+ per bag every few weeks to a month or so depending on how much they eat.

Take into account the cost of maintaining proper vet care as well. The average veterinary appointment will run you at least $50 each visit, not including treatment (vaccines, heartworm tests, etc.) Vets typically recommend a yearly wellness visit, and that doesn’t include treatment that may pop up for issues along the way, like x-rays, antibiotics, or surgeries.


Monthly heartworm, flea, and tick medications typically cost $100+ for a year’s worth of doses depending on your pup’s weight.


Grooming costs for a Chihuahua are on the lower end if you choose to groom yourself. You’ll need a dog-friendly shampoo for bathtime, a brush designed for their coat, tooth-brushing supplies, toenail clippers, and an ear-cleaning solution with cotton balls, at minimum. If you choose to have a groomer take care of these tasks, a single session may cost around $25–$40.

Toys, treats, beds, and accessories (leash, collar, bowls, training tools) add up as well, but they’re definitely the most fun to shop for!
Small beds cost around $25-$50+ depending on size and style, and walking accessories and training supplies usually clock in around ~$40 minimum for such small pups.
Chihuahuas deserve joy delivered every month!
