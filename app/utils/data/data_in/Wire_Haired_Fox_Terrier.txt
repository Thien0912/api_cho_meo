When it comes to coat care, Wire Haired Terriers require regular grooming to maintain their characteristic wiryâ¤ coat.

In addition, âregular trimming of the coatâ around the ears, feet, and underbelly is necessary to keep them neat and tidy. Bathing should be done as needed, using âa mild dog â¢shampoo to avoid strippingâ¢ the natural âoils from the coat.

They are loyal and âaffectionate, and they form strongâ bondsâ with their owners.
Due to their huntingâ¤ instincts, wire haired terriers may notâ always get along with other pets, especially smaller animals.

Wire Haired Terriers are known for their high energy levels and need for regular exercise. These dogs are intelligent â¢and active, and they require a consistent and structured exercise routineâ to keep them mentally and physically stimulated. Daily walks, runs, or play sessions are â¤essential to help them burn off excess energy and maintain a healthy weight. They also enjoy engaging in activities such as agility training, flyball, or obedience âtraining.
Additionally, wire haired terriers benefit from âmental stimulation through training activities. Training routines should be challenging and varied to keep these intelligentâ dogs engaged. Incorporating puzzle toys, obedience training, and interactive games can â£help keep their minds sharp and prevent behavioral issues âassociated with boredom.
It’sâ important toâ¢ note that wire haired terriersâ¤ can be independent and strong-willed, so consistent and positive reinforcement training methods are crucial forâ their successful development. âWith proper exercise and training, wire hairedâ¢ terriers can become well-behaved and well-adjusted companions for their owners.
Wire Haired Terriers are aâ¤ beloved breed known for theirâ energetic and spirited nature, but like all âdogs, âthey are prone to certain health issues that requireâ¢ special care and attention. Understanding these common health issues and how to properly care for your Wire Haired Terrier is âcrucial for maintaining their overall well-being and quality of life.
One of the most prevalent health concernsâ£ for Wire Haired Terriers is skin allergies and dermatitis. Their wiry coat can âmake them more susceptible to skinâ¢ irritation and allergic reactions to various environmental factors, such as pollen, dust, and certain grooming products. Regular grooming, including brushing andâ¤ bathing, âand paying attention to their diet and environment can help toâ alleviate these issues. Additionally, regular visits to â¤the veterinarianâ£ for check-ups and possible allergy testing may be necessary to properly manage and treat skin allergies.
Another common health issue for Wire Haired Terriers is dental problems. Due to their small size andâ¤ unique jaw structure,â¤ they are prone to tooth decay, gum disease, andâ¢ other dental issues. Proper dental care, including regular brushing and providing dental treats,â can help prevent these problems. Additionally, annual dental check-upsâ with a veterinarian and professional teethâ cleaning may be required to maintain good oral health for the breed.
Wire haired terriers, such as the Wire Fox Terrierâ¢ and the Airedale Terrier, have â¤distinct coats that require regular grooming and maintenance to keep them looking their best. Here are some essential  that will help youâ£ keep your furryâ friend healthy and happy:
Regular brushing is essential for wire haired terriers to prevent their coarse, wiry coats from â¤becoming mattedâ¤ and â¤tangled. Use a slicker â¢brush or a âgrooming rake to remove loose hairâ¢ and prevent the formation of mats. Additionally, a professional trim every few monthsâ can help maintain the shape and texture of the âwire haired terrier’s âcoat.
Wire â£haired terriers are prone â£to ear infections due to their long,â floppy ears. âIt’s important to check and clean âtheir ears regularly to prevent wax build-up and infections. Additionally, keepingâ¢ their nails trimmed and filed is crucial to prevent discomfort and issues withâ mobility.
Wire Haired Terriers are friendly, energetic, and intelligent âdogs that make wonderful companions. However,â£ like all dogs, they require âproper socialization to ensure they grow into well-behaved and balanced adults. Here are â£some  toâ¢ help them become âhappy and well-adjusted members of your family.

Step into the dynamic world of Wirehaired Fox Terriers, a breed that perfectly blends devotion, energy, and charm. Here's what you need to know about these little firecrackers that will spice up your life.
Wirehaired Fox Terriers are the epitome of alertness. These dogs are always ready to jump into action, whether it's playing fetch or guarding the house. They are keenly energetic, making them fantastic companions for those with an active lifestyle. But they don't just watch; they take part! Their role as excellent watchdogs is well-earned.
These dogs are not just playful; they're also exceptionally brave and adventurous. When it comes to loyalty and protectiveness, a Wirehaired Fox Terrier will be your steadfast defender. Couple this with a quirky and entertaining personality, and you've got a pet who's both fun and devoted.

As charming as they are, these terriers can present a few challenges. They require plenty of mental and physical activities to keep them from getting bored—and potentially destructive. Separation anxiety can also be an issue if they're left alone for long periods. They have an independent and strong-willed streak, which means they might test boundaries from time to time. They're also prone to wanderlust, so a securely fenced yard is advisable. If not properly socialized, they can be a bit wary of strangers and may bark excessively.
Despite these little quirks, a Wirehaired Fox Terrier is a package full of joy. Their enthusiasm, playfulness, and feisty nature make them lovable companions who will keep you entertained and feel loved.
Originating in 17th-century Britain, these terriers were initially bred to keep farms free of rats and mice and to assist in fox hunting. Their fearlessness and courage were highly valued traits that made them exceptional hunting dogs. They love to be trained and can quickly pick up new tricks, underlining their intelligence and eagerness to please. However, they do prefer human attention and may not get along well with other dogs.
Fortunately, Wirehaired Fox Terriers are generally a healthy breed, boasting an average lifespan of 13-14 years. Proper care and regular check-ups can help ensure a long, healthy life for your lively companion.
In summary, if you're looking for a pet that brings together intelligence, energy, and a dash of whimsy, a Wirehaired Fox Terrier might just be your perfect match. With the right attention and training, you'll have a fun-loving family member who's always ready for the next adventure.

These cute furballs can be prone to several eye conditions, some of which are pretty serious! Glaucoma, for instance, is a no-joke eye condition that can occur in both humans and our four-legged friends. It can escalate to blindness quickly if untreated, and it's painful! We might not always catch that our dogs are in pain, but imagine the feeling of being poked in the eye with an ice pick! Yikes! So if you notice symptoms like squinting, watery eyes, or a change in eye color, it's an emergency—rush to the vet ASAP!
If you notice the lenses of their eyes getting cloudy during vet check-ups, it could be cataracts. Don't fret, though; dogs are adaptable creatures and many adjust well to vision loss. And surgery is also an option to restore their sight. Another thing to look out for is Primary Lens Luxation (PLL), an inherited condition that causes the lens inside the eye to fall out of place, often leading to secondary glaucoma. If you notice anything odd, early treatment could make a world of difference.
Did you know that while humans might sneeze and get watery eyes from allergies, our Wirehaired Fox Terriers get itchy skin instead? Yep, it's called ‘atopy,' and it's pretty common among these breeds. You'll often notice them licking their paws or rubbing their faces a lot. The good news? Lots of treatments are available to make your pup more comfortable.

Ever notice your Fox Terrier running around and suddenly skipping or hopping? That's likely due to patellar luxation, a condition where the kneecap slips out of place. It might look odd, but mild cases often don't require more than some arthritis medication. If it's severe, though, surgery might be necessary.
Some Wirehaired Fox Terriers may exhibit a 'drunken sailor' walk due to a condition known as wobbler disease. This condition can make your dog's hind legs unstable and lead to stumbling or even falling. Multiple treatments are available, ranging from medication to surgery, so keep an eye out for any signs and consult your vet.
Heart failure is a concern for older Fox Terriers. Whether it's weakening valves leading to heart murmurs or inherited conditions like pulmonic stenosis, it's vital to have regular vet check-ups for early diagnosis and effective management.
Megesophagus is a condition where the food doesn't make it all the way to the stomach, which can cause your pup to throw up undigested food. Special feeding postures and diet modifications can help manage the condition. It's essential to address it early to avoid complications like pneumonia.
If your Wirehaired Fox Terrier is prone to seizures, early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in their quality of life. Medication is usually needed to control seizures, so talk to your vet about the best options.
Your pup might look perfectly healthy, but some Wirehaired Fox Terriers have inherited bleeding disorders that only become apparent when they get injured or undergo surgery. Routine testing before surgical procedures can be a lifesaver.
This is a heartbreaking disease similar to ALS in humans, causing hind leg weakness and eventually paralysis. Sadly, there's no cure, but treatments like rehab and dietary supplements can provide some relief.

Demodex mites live in all dogs, but Wirehaired Fox Terriers sometimes have a population explosion, leading to skin irritations. Thankfully, this is often a condition they outgrow.
From overbites to underbites, these dogs can have some dental challenges. Yes, dogs can get braces, and early intervention can prevent many problems down the line.
Cancer is a leading cause of death in older Wirehaired Fox Terriers. Regular check-ups can help with early detection and treatment, potentially adding years to your dog's life.
Lastly, hereditary deafness can be an issue in some Wirehaired Fox Terriers. If you think your dog might be affected, consult your vet for a thorough hearing workup.

Since the ancestors of the Fox Terrier, the hunt terriers, contained broken coated, wire coated and smooth terriers, it is understandable that the early Fox Terriers contained dogs of all three coats and in the early show classes they were shown together. In the 1870s the Wires were given separate classes and from that time interbreeding of the two coats was discouraged.
Whilst the Smooth variety had been the first to be established, registered separately and had been more popular until 1920, the development of the Wire from the turn of the century was such that it overtook the Smooth as the most popular breed. Post war Britain saw many children learning to walk with the aid of the most popular toy: a model of a Wire Fox Terrier on a wheeled frame.
Sadly, the demands of trimming and presentation have made the breed less popular in modern society and in the show ring.
Dogs originally bred and used for hunting vermin. 'Terrier' comes from the Latin word Terra, meaning earth. This hardy collection of dogs were selectively bred to be extremely brave and tough, and to pursue fox, badger, rat and otter (to name but a few) above and below ground. Dogs of terrier type have been known here since ancient times, and as early as the Middle Ages, these game breeds were portrayed by writers and painters.

Sharp, independent minded and clever, the quick little Wire Fox Terrier is a formidable foe should you happen to be a rat, mouse or fox. Typical of the terrier type, the Wire Fox is inclined to kill first, ask questions later, and so owners should be aware of their high prey drive and desire to behave like a terrier!  Around the house, Wire Fox Terriers are good and amusing companions, if given sufficient training and solid socialisation and habituation to family life – however a bored or under-stimulated Fox Terrier is likely to be loud and destructive.
Developed in the 19th Century from a variety of working terrier types, particularly the wire coated black and tan terriers from Wales, Derbyshire and Durham. They were used to flush out foxes who had gone to ground and for general ratting and watch dog purposes. Originally the Fox Terrier was classed as one breed with two coat varieties, the Wire and the Smooth, however they are now considered separate breeds with their own respective breed standards.
If you enjoy hand stripping and grooming, along with entertaining a smart yet sparky terrier, the Wire Fox Terrier might be your ideal companion. You’ll need to enjoy long walks, and training both on basic manners and entertaining trick training. With socialisation, training and common sense management the Fox Terrier does well in a rural setting, on a stable yard or similar outdoorsy lifestyle.
Although the modern Wire Fox Terrier is primarily a show and companion dog, the working ability remains strong. An hours walk per day should be considered the minimum, with much more exercise being welcome, alongside training, games and doggy sports or competition.
Suited to most homes whether country or urban but they will need a very secure garden, and plenty of interesting walking routes with space to run and play games.
Small dog breeds, such as the Wire Fox Terrier, have a fast metabolism, meaning they burn energy at a high rate, although their small stomachs mean that they must eat little and often. Small-breed foods are specifically designed with appropriate levels of key nutrients and smaller kibble sizes to suit smaller mouths. This also encourages chewing and improves digestion. You can find out more about balanced diets for dogs with our step-by-step guide.
The thick, wiry coat of the Wire Fox Terrier is 2-4cm in length and the undercoat is short and soft. The facial hair gives the breed a most distinguished look. So, dog grooming for this breed involves a brush and comb through every other day will keep the coat knot-free. But it will also need to be hand stripped (where the dead hair is plucked out) three to four times a year or it will open out and become fluffy, attract dirt and let in water easily.
Best motivated with food and toys and the opportunity to play out the ‘chase-grab-kill’ sequence in appropriate ways, the Wire Fox Terrier may be fun to train for the clever and dedicated trainer. If dog training is not your thing however, this may not be the pet for you. Focus on teaching a rock-solid recall, and socialise well with other animals when young, as a fearful Fox Terrier is likely to respond aggressively rather than shying away.
Better suited to quiet, steady homes either with no children or older children who can follow rules and respect a dog’s space. Although good with their own children, terriers are not inclined to tolerate clumsy or overbearing children. For those who like training as a hobby or enjoy long walks, the Wire Fox Terrier can be an excellent companion.
While many dogs are traditionally thought of as being good with children, all dogs and children need to be taught to get on with and respect each other, and be safe together. Even so, dogs and young children should never be left alone together and adults should supervise all interactions between them.
The name ‘terrier’ derives from the Latin ‘terra’ meaning earth. Small terriers like the Wire Fox Terrier were original bred to go to ground, down into the holes that foxes and badgers live in. This means being small enough to fit into those holes, brave enough to face a frightened fox or badger head on, and nimble enough to drive them out of their den. It is therefore not a surprise that many terriers believe themselves to be far bigger and more fearsome than their actual size suggests.
