The Siamese cat (Thai: แมวไทย, Maeo  Thai; แมวสยาม, Maeo Sayam) is one of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat. It derives from the Wichianmat landrace. The Siamese cat is one of several varieties of cats native to Thailand (known as Siam before 1939). The original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.[1] Siamese cats have a distinctive colourpoint coat, resulting from a temperature-sensitive type of albinism.
Distinct features like blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an elongated, slender, and muscular body, and various forms of point colouration characterise the modern-style Siamese. The modern-style Siamese's point-colouration resembles the "old-style" foundation stock. The "old-style" Siamese have a round head and body. They have been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat. Siamese and Thai cats are selectively bred and pedigreed in multiple cat fancier and breeder organisations. The terms "Siamese" or "Thai" are used for cats from this specific breed, which are by definition all purebred cats with a known and formally registered ancestry. The ancestry registration is the cat's pedigree or "paperwork".[2][3]
The Siamese is a part of the foundation stock for crossbreeding with other cats. The crossbreeding resulted in many different types of cats, like the Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair. The Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair were developed to expand the range of coat patterns. The breeding of the Oriental and Colourpoint Shorthairs resulted in a long-haired variant called the Himalayan. The long-haired Siamese is recognised internationally as a Balinese cat. The breeding also created the hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and blue-point Siamese cat.
A description and depiction of the Wichianmat (Siamese cat) first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand. The manuscripts have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library and National Library of Australia.
At the end of the Burmese–Siamese war, the capitol was sacked on 7 April 1767. The Burmese army burned everything in sight and returned to Burma, taking Siamese noblemen and royal family members with them as captives. A Thai legend states that the King of Burma Hsinbyushin found and read the poem for the Thai cats in the Tamra Maew. The poem describes Thai cats as being as rare as gold, and anyone who owns this cat will become wealthy. He told his army to round up all the Suphalak cats and bring them back to Burma along with the other treasures. Today in Thailand, people tell this legend as a humorous explanation of the rarity of Thai cats.[4]
The pointed cat known in the West as "Siamese", recognised for its distinctive markings, is one of several breeds of cats from Siam described and illustrated in manuscripts called "Tamra Maew" (Cat Poems). The "Tamra Maew" is estimated to have been written from the 14th to the 18th century.[5] In 1878, U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes received the first documented Siamese to reach the United States. The cat, named "Siam," was sent from Bangkok to the American Consul. 
[6] In 1884, the British Consul-General in Bangkok, Edward Blencowe Gould (1847–1916),[7] brought a breeding pair of the cats, Pho and Mia, back to Britain as a gift for his sister, Lilian Jane Gould (who, married in 1895 as Lilian Jane Veley,[8] went on to co-found the Siamese Cat Club in 1901).  In 1885, Gould's UK cats Pho and Mia produced three Siamese kittens—Duen Ngai, Kalohom, and Khromata—who were shown with their parents that same year at London's Crystal Palace Show. Their appearance and behaviour attracted attention, but all three of the kittens died soon after the show, their cause of death not documented.[9]

In the 1950s–1960s, as the Siamese was increasing in popularity, many breeders and cat show judges began to favour the more slender look. Breeders created increasingly long, fine-boned, narrow-headed cats through generations of selective breeding. Eventually, the modern show Siamese was bred to be extremely elongated, with a lean, tubular body, long, slender legs, a very long, very thin tail that tapers gradually into a point, and a long, wedge-shaped head topped by extremely large, wide-set ears.[citation needed]
By the mid-1980s, cats of the original style had largely disappeared from cat shows. Still, a few breeders, particularly in the UK, continued to breed and register them, resulting in today's two types of Siamese: the modern, "show-style", standardised Siamese, and the "Traditional Siamese", both descended from the same distant ancestors, but with few or no recent ancestors in common, and effectively forming distinct sub-breeds, with some pressure to separate them.[citation needed]
In addition to the modern Siamese breed category, The International Cat Association (TICA) and the World Cat Federation (WCF) now accept Siamese cats of the less extreme type, and any wichianmat cat imported directly from Thailand, under the new breed name Thai.[12][13] Other, mostly unofficial, names for the traditional variety are "Old-style Siamese" and "Classic Siamese", with an American variation nicknamed "Applehead".[14][15]
The breed standard of the modern Siamese calls for an elongated, tubular, and muscular body and a triangular head, forming a triangle from the tip of the nose to each tip of the ear. The eyes are almond-shaped and light blue, while the ears are large, wide-based, and positioned more towards the side of the head. The breed has a long neck, a slender tail, and fur that is short, glossy, fine and adheres to the body with no undercoat. Its pointed colour scheme and blue eyes distinguish it from the closely related Oriental Shorthair. The modern Siamese shares the pointed colour pattern with the Thai, or traditional Siamese, but they differ in head and body type.
The pointed pattern is a form of partial albinism, resulting from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated tyrosinase enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures but becomes active in cooler (< 33 °C) areas of the skin.[16] The heat-sensitive enzyme results in a dark colouration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, like the extremities and the face, which are cooled by the airflow through their sinuses. Siamese kittens are cream or white at birth and develop visible points in the first few months of life in colder parts of their body.[17] By the time a kitten is four weeks old, the points should be sufficiently distinguishable to recognise which colour they are.[citation needed]
Siamese cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult Siamese living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. Originally the vast majority of Siamese had seal (extremely dark brown, almost black) points, but occasionally Siamese was born with "blue" (a cool grey) points, genetically a dilution of seal point; chocolate (lighter brown) points, a genetic variation of seal point; or lilac (pale warm grey) points, genetically a diluted chocolate. These colours were considered "inferior" seal points and were not qualified for showing or breeding. These shades were eventually accepted by the breed associations and became more common through breeding programmes specifically aimed at producing these colours. Later, outcrosses with other breeds developed Siamese-mix cats with points in other cat colours and patterns, including red and cream points, lynx (tabby) points, and tortoise-shell ("tortie") points. (For more information on cat coat terminology, see Cat coat genetics.)[citation needed]
In the United Kingdom, all pointed Siamese-style cats are considered part of the Siamese breed.[citation needed] The Cat Fanciers' Association, considers only the four original fur colours as Siamese:
Oriental Shorthair cats with colour points in colours or patterns aside from these four are considered Colourpoint Shorthair in that registry. The World Cat Federation has also adopted this classification, treating the Colourpoint Shorthair as a distinct breed.[13]
Many Siamese cats from Thailand had a kink in their tails, but over the years, this trait has been considered a flaw. Breeders have largely eradicated it, but the kinked tail persists among street cats in Thailand.[citation needed]
Siamese are usually very affectionate and intelligent cats, renowned for their social nature. Many enjoy being with people and are sometimes described as "extroverts". Often they bond strongly with a single person.[9] Myrna Milani describes the Siamese as being more diurnal, more likely to stay close to their owner, and less likely to hunt than other cats.[19]
Based on Swedish insurance data, which tracked cats only up to 12.5 years, Siamese and Siamese-derived breeds have a higher mortality rate than other breeds. 68% lived to 10 years or more and 42% to 12.5 years or more. The majority of deaths were caused by neoplasms, mainly mammary tumours. The Siamese also has a higher rate of morbidity. They are at higher risk of neoplastic and gastrointestinal problems but have a lower risk of feline lower urinary tract disease.[20][21] A UK study of veterinary records found a life expectancy of 11.69 years for the Siamese compared with 11.74 years overall.[22]
The Siamese has been found to have a predisposition to progressive retinal atrophy.[23]
The same albino allele that produces coloured points means that Siamese cats' blue eyes lack a tapetum lucidum, a structure which amplifies dim light in the eyes of other cats. The mutation in the tyrosinase also results in abnormal neurological connections between the eye and the brain.[24] The optic chiasm has abnormal uncrossed wiring; many early Siamese were cross-eyed to compensate, but like the kinked tails, the crossed eyes have been seen as a fault, and due to selective breeding the trait is far less common today. Still, this lack of a tapetum lucidum even in uncross-eyed cats, causes reduced vision for the cat at night. This trait makes them vulnerable to urban dangers such as night-time vehicular traffic. Unlike many other blue-eyed white cats,[25] Siamese cats do not have reduced hearing ability.
The Siamese suffers from abnormal visual projections due to the lateral geniculate body of the eye differing from normal felines. Fibres located in the temporal retina cross over in the chiasm instead of remaining uncrossed.[26]
The Siamese is predisposed to periocular leukotrichia, pinnal alopecia, and psychogenic alopecia.[27]
Young Siamese cats are predisposed to histiocytic cutaneous mast cell tumours.[28]
The Siamese is one of the more commonly affected breeds for gangliosidosis 1. An autosomal recessive mutation in the GBL1 gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.[29]
Siamese cats have been protagonists in literature and film for adults and children since the 1930s. Clare Turlay Newberry's Babette[32] features a Siamese kitten escaping from a New York apartment in 1937. British publisher Michael Joseph recorded his relationship with his Siamese cat in Charles: The Story of a Friendship (1943).[33] The "Siamese Cat Song" sequence ("We are Siamese if you please") in Disney's Lady and the Tramp (1955), features the cats "Si" and "Am", both titled after the former name of Thailand, where the breed originated. The 1958 film adaptation of Bell, Book and Candle features Kim Novak's Siamese cat "Pyewacket", a witch's familiar.
The Incredible Journey (1961)[34] by Sheila Burnford tells the story of three pets, including the Siamese cat "Tao", as they travel 300 miles (480 km) through the Canadian wilderness searching for their beloved masters. The book was a modest success when first published but became widely known after 1963 when it was loosely adapted into a film of the same name by Walt Disney. Disney also employed the same Siamese in the role of "DC" for its 1965 crime caper That Darn Cat!,[35] with The New York Times commenting "The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb. [...] This elegant, blue-eyed creature is a paragon of suavity and grace".[36]

Cat Breeds
If you've been looking for a cat that likes to talk back to you, consider the Siamese. Among the most vocal of all breeds, these chatty cats love nothing more than to spend time alongside their favorite people, eagerly offering advice and opinions about everything that happens throughout the day.
Talkative tendencies are just the beginning. Siamese cats are friendly and playful, with the ability to get along well with just about everyone as long as they are properly socialized as kittens.
The Siamese cat's beautiful blue eyes contribute to the breed's stunning appearance. Since looks aren't everything, it's important to note that the Siamese cat is highly intelligent and more than a little curious. These cats keep their families amused with their antics and they are usually more than happy to learn simple tricks. Playing fetch is a favorite pastime, and outdoor walks on leashes are often enjoyed, as well.
Very busy families might do better with a cat that requires less attention, as the Siamese can quickly develop unwanted behaviors if left alone for too long. The good news is that if you have always wanted a Siamese kitten, having a second cat or a friendly dog that's willing to stand in as a playmate can be a remedy for the kind of boredom that can lead to destructive tendencies. This doesn't mean that you'll be able to leave your cat to its own devices, but it helps to have another animal to provide companionship when you cannot be at your cat's beck and call.
Overall, Siamese cats are marvelous companions and fantastic snugglers. No wonder the Siamese is one of the world's most popular cat breeds!
The Siamese cat has no special nutritional needs, however it is vital to offer a high-quality diet that is appropriate for your cat's life stage. A diet that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates can help prevent obesity, particularly later in life.
Thanks to their short, single layer coats, Siamese cats are very easy to care for. Simply give your cat a good rubdown with your fingers once or twice per week to remove any loose hair and cut back on shedding. In addition, you might want to use a chamois cloth or a silk scarf to polish your cat's coat to a gleaming shine.
Siamese cats are prone to periodontal disease, so make dental health a priority. You might be able to cut back on expensive dental cleanings by brushing your cat's teeth at home every day.
Last but not least, consider clipping your cat's claws. Siamese cats have a tendency to use their front paws like hands, getting into drawers and cupboards. Keeping their toenails clipped can help prevent damage to your furniture.
The Siamese is a naturally playful, active cat with a tendency to seek high places. Provide a tall cat tree to satisfy the natural urge to jump and climb, and take time out to offer interactive play sessions. Siamese cats enjoy all kinds of toys, particularly those that stimulate the mind. For example, a puzzle toy that dispenses treats is likely to be a favorite with any Siamese.
Siamese tend to be very healthy cats and many enjoy exceptionally long lives, often surviving into their 20s. Even so, there are several potential health concerns to be aware of including respiratory infections and a type of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Siamese cats are also more sensitive to anesthesia than other cats, meaning that surgical procedures can pose a higher risk.
Crossed eyes and kinked tails are two common issues for Siamese cats. Neither is serious, although crossed eyes can prevent the affected cat from enjoying good peripheral vision.
The Siamese cat is a natural aristocrat, originally bred in the kingdom of Siam, which we know as Thailand today. Because these cats were considered sacred in ancient Siam, only members of royalty and Buddhist monks were allowed to keep them.
The breed was first described in the ancient Tamra Maew manuscripts also known as The Cat-Book Poems, which was curated during the Ayutthaya Kingdom between 1351 and 1767.
When European dignitaries began visiting Siam in the 1800s, they were often impressed with the cats and as a gesture of goodwill, members of the Siamese royal family began offering Siamese cats as gifts. These cats made their way to Europe with their new families, quickly gaining popularity for their exquisite appearance and unique personalities.
In 1878, Bangkok’s American consul gave a Siamese cat named “Siam” to U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes and First Lady Lucy Hayes. Siam was the first Siamese to reach America.
In 1884, British Consulate General Edward Blencowe Gould brought a breeding pair of Siamese cats to his sister, Lilian Jane Gould, who co-founded Britain’s Siamese Cat Club in 1901. Most British Siamese cats can be traced back to just 11 original imports.
The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) granted official recognition in 1906, making the Siamese one of the oldest pedigreed cat breeds in existence.
By the 1950s and 1960s, the Siamese had gained popularity worldwide. Today, the breed is accepted by all cat registries. Long-haired Siamese cats are typically registered as Balinese.
There are two main types of Siamese cats: the traditional (old-style) Siamese and the modern (wedge-head) Siamese. The modern Siamese has a longer, leaner appearance, while the traditional Siamese has rounder lines.
Seal point is the most common Siamese color, and was first to be accepted by the CFA.
All Siamese kittens are born white; the color points develop as the kittens grow.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The Siamese, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed Siamese or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase a Siamese, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
Siamese cats cost between $600 - $1200.
Siamese cats tend to be small in size. A fully grown Siamese cat might weigh between 8-15 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 8"- 10" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for Siamese is 15-20 years.
Siamese are short-haired cats. Therefore, they do not shed as much as long-haired cat breeds.
What’s a cool name for a male purebred Siamese kitten?
My Siamese is extremely large she is not ey sociable and her coat is chocolate from the shoulders down her tail is very long and she is quite vocal she doesn’t get along with other cats but she had a love affair with my multese since he passed she is not so affectionate is shea true siemese she was all white as a kitten
She sounds lovely! Thanks for sharing, Lily 🙂
I adopt a Siamese cat a week ago. I’m worried because she isn’t playful. She hides a lot from me and my daughter. She doesn’t play with her toys and she only eats when my daughter puts her to her plate. Any suggestions on what we can do?
Hi Tris, it sounds like your new kitty is most likely just taking a bit of time to settle into the home and family, but you should have her see a vet to confirm that she’s healthy. Assuming that everything looks okay, you can follow the steps in our guide to helping a new cat feel at home in 8 steps.
Do cats bite and pin down another cat of the same breed in the household because the one being attacked is sick?  My siamese cats are both males and 17 years old. Have had them from kittens.  However, now the larger cat has been very mean and aggressive at times to the smaller one, biting his neck and pinning him down until he screams.  Is the smaller cat maybe sick?
Hmm, that’s a good question. I haven’t been able to find an indication that cats will take advantage of the weakness associated with illness, though it does seem like there has been some change in the social hierarchy here. Since they’ve presumably gotten along for the last 17-ish years and are suddenly having this problem, I’d point more towards a change in the bully cat’s mind than a change in the victim’s health. Have any other household dynamics changed? Any changes, like a house move, refurnishing or remodeling, new family members, or even your own stress levels, could contribute to this shift. They are both pretty mature cats, so I also wonder if (sadly) the older cat may be dealing with dementia..this can cause anxiety and aggression in cats. I hope all is well with both of your kitties, at any rate.
My Siamese is a DSH they are all black but seem to have all the chartrists of the pointed ones. Is it just because they are mixed bread that they are all Black?
Not sure what you mean! Is your cat Siamese or a DSH (domestic shorthair)? It sounds to me like your cat is simply a shorthaired black moggy. Many cats will share some traits with Siamese cats, but that doesn’t mean that they are related to the Siamese at all.
Met my first Siamese when I was 10….fell in love. Only Siamese for me. Got my first Seal Point kitten 39 years ago. He was beautiful, loving, cuddly, playful and curious. Had several loving Siamese rescues since, one we thought was Lynx point Siamese, turned out to be Siberian. Broke my Siamese only, but he was very sweet. Our current Meezer, now 3, came to us at about 8 months, and had been passed through 3-4 homes. He had been trained, hopefully unintentional,  to bite and attack to play or to get what he wants, therefore none kept him. Loves dogs, not so much other cats, and fears people he doesn’t know. He is still unlearning those behaviors, be we are making progress. People adopting Siamese must understand them first. Besides beautiful, Siamese are very intelligent, demanding, overly curious, easily bored, talkative and sometimes argumentative, energetic – very well known for frequent ‘zoomies’.  We also love our dogs and our Siamese have always been a good match with them. Our current loves leash walking, alone or with the dogs, and gone on many hikes while camping. Siamese are absolutely the best from the feline world!
I have a Manx and Siamese cross, she is independent/dependent and quite curious especially with any task I am doing.  Mila can be very stubborn when she wants to do something and its hard to persuade her not to do something. Has been dog trained so she does more dog behavior but she is still a cat.  I can’t imagine life without her.
My beloved Siamese, Mufasa, rules me with an iron paw, and takes shocking advantage of it. I adore him, and he knows it.
My Siamese is on the large side, 25″ long, 17″ tall and 22lbs. People fawn over him not only for his beauty but his impressive size. He has a few tricks he likes to show off – his favorite is catching treats thrown to him. Am very lucky to be able to be with him almost 24/7. A Siamese can be the best cat companion!
Sounds absolutely stunning. Lucky you—be sure to give him some extra appreciation today.
My husband and I had   a Siamese Seal Point   during our early marriage!   He was intelligent, vocal and very loving.      Enjoyed company when they visited, too.
Nice! Thanks for sharing.
acts like a dog, is cute though.

8 – 10 inches
Weight:
6 – 12 pounds
Lifespan:
14 – 20 years
Colors:
Gray, black, blueish-gray, bi-colored gray and white
Suitable for:
Owners who are looking for a highly interactive and engaging pet
Temperament:
Affectionate, curious, and easily adaptable to new unfamiliar environments
Siamese cats are a fascinating breed known for their unique appearance and distinct personality traits. While they’re not a mix of other breeds, Siamese cats actually have a long and rather interesting history. Originating in Thailand (formerly known as Siam), these cats were highly valued by royalty and revered for their beauty and grace. They were even believed to possess mystical powers, believe it or not.
One of the most striking features of Siamese cats is their blue almond-shaped eyes. Their short, sleek coat comes in various color points, with the body being lighter in color than the face, ears, paws, and tail. This pattern is caused by a gene that affects the production of pigment in their fur.
In terms of personality though, Siamese cats are known for being very intelligent and social creatures. They’re often described as being very vocal, with a distinct and loud voice that they use to communicate their needs and desires.

Siamese kittens, like most kittens, are full of energy and curiosity, often exploring their surroundings with great enthusiasm. They’re highly social animals and enjoy the company of humans and other pets. Siamese kittens are also known for their vocal nature, often communicating with their owners through a range of meows and purrs. Their striking blue eyes and sleek coat add to their charm, making them a popular choice for cat lovers.
And when it comes to buying Siamese kittens, it can vary in terms of ease depending on your location and availability. In some areas, there may be breeders or pet stores that specialize in Siamese cats, making it relatively easy to find and purchase a kitten. However, in other areas (like in smaller cities or rural areas), Siamese kittens may be less common, requiring more effort to locate a breeder or source.
The cost of Siamese kittens can also vary significantly depending on various factors. Purebred Siamese kittens from reputable breeders are generally more expensive compared to mixed or non-purebred kittens. The price can also be influenced by factors such as the kitten’s lineage, coloration, and the breeder’s reputation. On average, Siamese kittens can range anywhere from $500 to $2,800 or more. It’s important to consider the cost as well as the long-term commitment involved before deciding to bring a Siamese kitten into your home.

Definitely. Siamese cats can make great additions to families due to their affectionate and super social nature. These cats are known for being highly interactive and forming strong bonds with their owners, including children. They seem to even thrive on human companionship and enjoy being involved in family activities. Siamese cats are often described as being loyal, gentle, and playful, making them suitable companions for families with children.
While individual personalities can vary, Siamese cats tend to be friendly and adaptable, making it easier for them to get along with other animals in the household. However, as with any pet, proper introductions and a slow, measured approach are important to ensure a harmonious relationship between Siamese cats and other pets (especially large dogs).
When introducing a Siamese cat to another pet, it’s essential to provide a controlled and safe environment. This can be done by initially keeping the pets in separate areas and allowing them to become familiar with each other’s scents before any direct contact is made. You may also want to closely supervise all initial interactions with your cat and any other pets in your home. Like any other feline, these cats can and will become aggressive if they feel threatened in any way. The success of the introduction largely depends on the personalities of the animals involved. Just try to remember that every cat is an individual, and some Siamese cats may have a more dominant or territorial nature that could affect their ability to get along with other animals.
It is also worth noting that proper socialization from a young age can greatly increase the chances of a Siamese cat getting along well with other pets. Exposing them to different animals early on can help them develop positive associations and reduce the likelihood of fear or aggression towards other pets in the future.

Siamese cats are known for their active and energetic nature, so a diet that provides them with the right balance of nutrients is essential. The number of calories a Siamese cat needs per day can vary depending on factors such as age, weight, and activity level. On average, an adult Siamese cat requires around 200–300 calories per day. However, note that this is just a general guideline and individual cats may have different needs.
Also, look for cat food brands that specifically cater to the needs of Siamese cats, as these will contain the necessary proteins, vitamins, and minerals to keep them healthy. Some of the best cat food brands for Siamese cats include Royal Canin Siamese Breed Nutrition, Blue Buffalo Wilderness High Protein Dry Cat Food, and Hill’s Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach & Skin Dry Cat Food.
These brands are known for their high-quality ingredients and comprehensive nutritional profiles. However, it’s always a good idea to consult with your vet to determine the specific dietary requirements of your Siamese cat – especially if it’s your first one. A vet can tell you about the health conditions that these cats are prone to and advise accordingly. We’ll discuss some of these in more detail in a bit.
Siamese cats are known for their high energy levels and active nature. They require a good amount of daily activity and exercise to keep them physically and mentally stimulated. It’s recommended that Siamese cats engage in at least 30 minutes to an hour of exercise each day. This can include playing with toys, interactive games, or even going for walks on a leash. Regular exercise not only helps to keep them fit and healthy but also helps to prevent behavioral issues that may arise from pent-up energy.
To keep Siamese cats entertained, try to provide them with a variety of stimulating activities. Interactive toys such as puzzle feeders or treat-dispensing toys can keep them engaged and mentally stimulated. Playing hide-and-seek games or engaging in interactive play sessions with their owners can also provide a great source of entertainment for Siamese cats – many of these toys you can make yourself with stuff you have around the house.
It’s important to note that Siamese cats are really social animals and thrive on human companionship. Spending quality time with them, such as grooming or cuddling, can also help to keep them entertained and happy. Also, providing them with vertical spaces like cat trees or shelves can give them opportunities for climbing and exploring, which can be highly entertaining for them.
Training a Siamese cat can be a rewarding experience and can help them to become easier pets to handle once they reach adulthood. The good thing is that they’re highly intelligent and just need positive reinforcement and consistency to get things down. So, start training your Siamese cat from an early age.
Siamese kittens are like little sponges and can easily pick up on cues and commands. Begin with basic obedience commands and perhaps some potty training. Use treats as a reward and be patient with your cat. Siamese cats respond well to a calm and consistent training approach.
Siamese cats also enjoy interactive play sessions. Use toys that encourage mental stimulation and physical exercise. Puzzle toys and treat-dispensing toys are great for keeping Siamese cats entertained and mentally engaged. Incorporate playtime into your daily routine to keep your Siamese cat happy and active.
Siamese cats have short, sleek coats that require minimal grooming. And due to their grooming habits, these cats generally don’t require regular baths. However, there may be certain circumstances where a bath is necessary. For example, if your Siamese cat gets into something sticky or dirty, a bath may be needed to remove the substance from their fur. Additionally, if your Siamese cat has a skin condition or allergies that cause excessive oil production or itching, a bath with a specially formulated shampoo recommended by your veterinarian may be beneficial.
Also, regular grooming can help keep their coats healthy and shiny. So, you’ll need to brush your Siamese cat’s coat once a week to remove any loose hair and prevent matting. You can use a soft bristle brush or a grooming glove to gently brush their fur. It’s also important to trim your Siamese cat’s nails regularly to prevent them from becoming too sharp or causing any injuries. You can also simply take your cat to the groomer every 6 to 8 weeks and have them do these things.
Minor Conditions
Serious Conditions
One of the most noticeable distinctions between the two sexes is their physical appearance. Male Siamese cats tend to be larger and more muscular than their female counterparts. They typically have a more robust frame and a broader head. On the other hand, female Siamese cats are generally smaller and more petite, with a somewhat slimmer and daintier appearance. These differences can vary from cat to cat, but they are commonly observed among the breed overall.
Another significant difference between male and female Siamese cats lies in their temperament and behavior. Male Siamese cats are often more laid-back and easygoing compared to females, which tend to be more assertive and independent. Males are typically known for their affectionate nature and enjoy being lap cats, seeking out attention and cuddles from their human companions. Females, on the other hand, may display a slightly more aloof demeanor and prefer to maintain their own personal space. They can still be loving and affectionate, but they may not seek out attention as actively as males.
One particular aspect where male and female Siamese cats differ is in their vocalization. Siamese cats are famously known for their talkative nature, but males tend to be more vocal than females. Male Siamese cats often have a louder and more persistent meow, which they use to communicate their needs or seek attention from their owners. Females, although still vocal, may not exhibit the same level of intensity in their meowing.

Siamese cats are believed to have originated from Thailand, which was previously known as Siam. They were considered sacred and were kept by members of the royal family. Siamese cats were highly valued and were often given as royal gifts.
Siamese cats are known for their vocal nature and ability to communicate with their owners – sort of like Huskies. They have a wide range of vocalizations, including loud meows, chirps, and even trills. They’re also not afraid to express their opinions and will often engage in fun “conversations” with their owners.
Siamese cats have a unique trait called “temperature-sensitive albinism.” This means that their coat color is affected by their body temperature. The cooler parts of their body, such as the extremities, have darker color points, while the warmer parts, such as the body, have lighter fur. This phenomenon is known as “point coloration” and is one of the defining characteristics of these gorgeous cats.

Siamese cats are also known for their intelligence and curiosity, so they require physical and mental stimulation to keep them entertained. Owners willing to dedicate time and energy to playing with their Siamese cats will find they make wonderful companions. Additionally, Siamese cats are known for their vocal nature, so owners who enjoy a chatty pet will appreciate their constant communication. Siamese cats are also known for their playful and mischievous nature, keeping their owners entertained with their antics. Overall, these adorable cats are best suited for owners who can provide them with a loving and interactive environment.

Siamese cats are a beautiful breed known for their vivid blue almond-shaped eyes, short coat, and unique color-point pattern. Because this breed is social, the Siamese cat thrives in loving and interactive homes where their need for attention and mental stimulation is met. The Siamese cat personality is also known for their highly extroverted nature. To that end, don’t be surprised if these cats follow you around, boop their faces against yours, or engage in vocal chatter. These cats are very talkative!
Like many other cat breeds, they enjoy interactive play sessions and puzzles that challenge their minds. Sure, they have no problem spending time napping throughout the day, but they also need their sharp minds challenged. You’ll want to spend time playing with these kitties to keep them from getting bored. Because of their social nature, these cats often get along well with other pets and children. However, they can become anxious if left alone for long periods, so providing them with company and attention is crucial for their well-being.
When considering a Siamese cat, it’s advisable to prioritize adopting from rescue organizations or shelters to provide a loving home to a cat in need. However, if you decide to purchase a Siamese kitten, it’s crucial to choose a reputable breeder. Conduct thorough research to ensure that the breeder follows ethical practices and prioritizes the well-being of their cats. Reputable Siamese breeders prioritize the health and temperament of their cats. They also conduct necessary health screenings, and provide a nurturing environment for the kitties. This active approach ensures that you bring home a healthy and happy kitty while discouraging unethical breeding practices.
Some cat breeds are typically independent and aloof, even if they’ve been raised by the same person since kittenhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn’t the only factor that goes into affection levels; cats who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.

If you’re going to share your home with a cat, you’ll need to deal with some level of cat hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary among the breeds.

Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems. This doesn’t mean that every cat of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they’re at an increased risk. If you’re looking only for purebred cats or kittens, it’s a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you’re interested in.

Some cats are perpetual kittens—full of energy and mischief—while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful kitten sounds endearing, consider how many games of chase the mouse-toy you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other animals who can stand in as playmates. A classic wand cat toy like this one is perfect for playful felines!

Some breeds sound off more often than others with meows, yowls, and chattering. When choosing a breed, think about how the cat vocalizes and how often. If constant “conversation” drives you crazy, consider a kitty less likely to chat.

Being tolerant of children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a nonchalant attitude toward running, screaming youngsters are all traits that make a kid-friendly cat. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual cat will behave; cats from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences and personality.

Some breeds require very little in the way of grooming; others require regular brushing to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a cat who needs daily brushing. You should definitely pick up this awesome de-shedding tool for cats of any hair length!

Some cat breeds are reputed to be smarter than others. But all cats, if deprived the mental stimulation they need, will make their own busy work. Interactive cat toys are a good way to give a cat a brain workout and keep them out of mischief. This scratcher cat toy can keep your smart kitty busy even when you’re not home!

The sophisticated Siamese looks dressed for an elegant masquerade ball in pale evening wear with chic black accessories and tanzanite-blue eyes. Cats with light-colored coats set off with black mask, ears, paws and tail have been known in Thailand (formerly Siam) for centuries. Ancient manuscripts depict the cats, but they were not seen in the West until the late nineteenth century, when they were exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in London.
Not everyone appreciated their unusual appearance, but they quickly became fashionable pets. By the turn of the century, if not earlier, they were popular in the United States as well. President Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) and his wife Lucy were the recipients of a Siamese cat shipped to them in 1878 by David B. Sickels, a U. S. diplomat stationed at the consulate in Thailand. A letter from Sickels detailing the gift is on file at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio.
At first, only the cats with seal points—a dark brownish-black—were shown, but blue, chocolate and lilac-point Siamese were soon developed and accepted in the show ring. Today Siamese come in many different point colors and patterns, including tabby points and smoke points.
The Siamese itself is a natural breed, meaning its original pointed pattern was the result of a genetic mutation. The breed has contributed to the creation of many other breeds, including the Balinese, Oriental, the Himalayan division of the Persian, the Tonkinese and the Havana Brown.
The Siamese is recognized by all cat associations. The International Cat Association also recognizes the Thai, described as the original form of the native pointed cat of Thailand. In Thailand the cats are called Wichienmaat. Some people refer to it as an old-style Siamese. It shares the pointed coat and domineering personality of the Siamese but has a more moderate body type.
Siamese cats are generally of medium size, with a slender and elegant build. Adult male Siamese cats typically weigh between 11-15 pounds, while adult females usually weigh between 8-12 pounds.
“We are Siamese if you please. We are Siamese if you don’t please.” Those lines, sung by two haughty Siamese cats in Disney’s Lady and the Tramp, express the Siamese personality perfectly. Perhaps the most important thing to know about these cats is they are talkative and opinionated. They will tell you exactly what they think, in a loud, raspy voice, and they expect you to pay attention and act on their advice.
Siamese cats are extremely fond of their people. They like to be “helpful” and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Siamese will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. Do not get a Siamese if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane.
On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, the Siamese can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Siamese do not like being left alone for long periods, and if you work during the day it can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.
The Siamese is highly intelligent, agile, athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty.
Choose a Siamese cat if you look forward to spending time with and interacting with your cat. This is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention. In the right home, however, he thrives for years.
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Problems that may affect the Siamese include the following:
The short, fine coat of the Siamese is easily cared for with weekly combing to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing.
It’s a good idea to keep a Siamese as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Siamese who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
What the Siamese looks like depends on the breed standard of each particular organization. Most cat associations call for the Siamese to have a svelte but muscular body with long lines. The wedge-shaped head is long and tapering from the narrow point of the nose outward to the tips of the ears, forming a triangle. The unusually large ears are wide at the base, pointed at the tip, giving them the same triangular shape as the head. Medium-size almond-shaped eyes are always a deep vivid blue.
The body is often described as tubular and is supported by long, slim legs, with the hind legs higher than the front legs. The Siamese walks on small, dainty, oval paws and swishes a long, thin tail that tapers to a fine point.
The International Cat Association allows for a range of colors beyond the four point colors recognized by CFA. They include tabby points, red points, cream points, silver tabby points, smoke points and particolor points. The Traditional Cat Association recognizes two types of Siamese, the Traditional and the Classic, both with a very different look than the modern Siamese recognized by CFA, TICA and other cat associations. The TCA’s Traditional Siamese has a round head and a big-boned, rounded body. The TCA’s Classic Siamese is also big-boned but has a slightly more elongated body than the Traditional Siamese and a wide wedge-shaped head. They come in the same four colors recognized by CFA, plus albino.
What about the Thai? The TICA breed standard calls for it to have modified wedge-shaped head of medium width with rounded cheeks and a muzzle that tapers to a rounded end, much like a tapered garden spade. The head is longer than it is wide, but not to an extreme degree. The eyes have a full almond shape and the ears are medium size to slightly large, with the tip pointing outward at a slight angle. The lithe, graceful body is moderately long but not tubular. Medium-length legs are graceful and are supported by medium-size oval-shaped paws. The tail is as long as the torso, tapering at the tip. The coat is short and silky with a pale, off-white body color and dense, even point colors.
The active and social Siamese is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. He will play fetch as well as any retriever, learns tricks easily and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect.

The Siamese cat is one of the most recognized cat breeds there are. The cat hails from Thailand and is the foundation stock for a number of other breeds.
It comes in two distinct variations -  traditional and the more modern Siamese.
In the United States, most of the top cat registries only consider the 4 original fur colors as Siamese – chocolate point,  seal point, blue point, and lilac point.
The Siamese cat is a medium-sized cat. Today’s Siamese cat is recognized by the triangular-shaped head, the slender, muscular body, the blue almond-shaped eyes, the largish ears, and the cream point colored coat.
The face of the Siamese also has a mask of the same point color. Weighing at between 3 – 5kg,  the Siamese has a long neck and slender tail.
All Siamese kittens are cream or white at birth, but they develop visible points in the first few months of life. The coat is short and glossy. By the time the kitten is 4 weeks old, the points are clearly distinguishable.
Siamese are affectionate, curious, playful, intelligent cats and are known for their vocal, social natures.
With the Siamese cat, you may see him bonding strongly with one particular person in the family.
They’re active cats and are also one of these cat breeds that are described as being more dog-like. Some of them become so attached to their human owners that they can become depressed or suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods of time.
Because of the cat’s intelligence, he can be easily trained to respond to simple commands.
The Siamese cat is such a popular breed and with good reason. It makes a splendid companion for single people, families, couples, and older people. It gets on well with children and other pets too.
However, it is an energetic cat and won’t relish lying around day after day. He will want you to play with him and exercise him too, providing him with a stimulating environment.
These are such affectionate cats too, that it will be too sad if he lands up in a home where people don’t provide him with love and care. In exchange for that, you couldn’t ask for a better companion and friend.
With good care, your Siamese cat can live to be between 12 and 20 years of age. It is a slim cat, so you want to keep him that way as becoming overweight can put a whole lot of pressure on the cat’s joints and bring on other health issues.
There are always some common cat diseases to watch out for and one of these is mammary tumors. They also battle with gastrointestinal problems and lung infections.
They are actually prone to respiratory problems, but this is more seen in younger cats. Upper respiratory infection with the Siamese cat will usually last about a week or it can go on longer.
Your cat with have a nasal or eye discharge, will be drooling as well as have ulcers around the nose and mouth with aches and pains aa well as lethargy.
Make sure that your Siamese cat is up to date with his vaccinations.
Good diet is one of the most important ways to care for your Siamese cat. Your cat is a carnivore and you therefore need to ensure he gets an appropriate diet otherwise you’re going to be spending more time at the vet with a sick cat than you’d like to.
Always check with your vet if you have any uncertainties about feeding your Siamese kitten. Kittens will eat different food to an adult, and even in adulthood, there is commercial cat food manufactured for adult cats, pregnant felines, lactating cats, energetic cats, senior cats and sick cats.
Where possible, you will need to try and provide your cat with some fresh, raw meat too.
Never leave your cat without a bowl of fresh, cool water night and day.
The coat of the Siamese cat is thick, soft, and silky and he will require a brush every week to keep it like that.
They are agile, athletic cats, loving to jump up onto perches so it will be a good idea to provide a climbing tree or some other equipment where the cat can leap up onto.
Provide your cat with a litter box and make sure that the cat’s feces are removed every single day.
