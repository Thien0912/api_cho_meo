The Mexican Hairless cat, also known as Aztec cat or New Mexican Hairless was a purported breed of cat first documented in 1902 by Mr. E. J. Shinick, who owned a pair of hairless cats. Despite having long whiskers and eyebrows and being known to sprout light fur around their backs and tails in the winter, the cats were considered novelties at the time due to their lack of a furry coat. Their lack of a coat causes them to lose more body heat than other cat breeds. This resulted in this breed being both heat-seeking and warm to the touch.
In 1902, a couple from New Mexico received two hairless cats from a local Pueblo community. These were ostensibly the last survivors of an ancient Aztec breed of cat. The cats were littermates and noted to be 25% smaller than local shorthair cats. They were normally whiskered and seasonally coated, growing a ridge of fur down the mid-back and tail during the colder seasons. These were not the first hairless cats exhibited in the US, but they became the most famous. An earlier detailed report was of a pair of hairless cats in The Boston Post, January 22, 1878. Those cats were a brother and sister, with the brother being named "Scud" and the sister, “Mystery”. They were owned by William P. Marshall and were exhibited. Although novelties, they had an ordinary background, being born to a normal shorthair cat, and did not become a sensation.[1]
In The Book of the Cat (1903, Public Domain), Frances Simpson reproduced a letter written by Mr. E. J. Shinick to Mr. H. C. Brooke regarding Mr. Shinick's hairless cats. Mr. Brooke commented "A most extraordinary variety, of which next to nothing appears to be known, is the hairless cat, and we cannot do better than quote in extenso the description given by the owner of what, if his surmise should unhappily prove to be correct, was the last pair of these peculiar animals, a portrait of which we give. We can only add, while deeply regretting that Mr. Shinick did not mate his cats, the earnest hope that we may hear that he has discovered the existence of other specimens."[2]
From The Book of the Cat, Frances Simpson, 1903 (public domain):
In answer would say my hairless cats are brother and sister. I got them from the Indians a few miles from this place. The old Jesuit Fathers tell me they are the last of the Aztec breed known only in New Mexico. I have found them the most intelligent and affectionate family pets I have ever met in the cat line; they are the quickest in action and smartest cats I have ever seen. They are fond of a warm bath, and love to sleep under the clothes at night with our little girl. They seem to understand nearly everything that is said to them; but I have never had time to train them. They are marked exactly alike - with mouse coloured backs; with neck, stomach and legs a delicate flesh tint. Their bodies are always warm and soft as a child's. They love to be fondled and caressed, and are very playful; will run up and down your body and around your waist like a flash.
"Nellie" weighs about eight pounds, and "Dick" weighed ten pounds; but I am sorry to say we have lost "Dick". We have never allowed them to go out of the house, as the dogs would be after them. They were very fond of our water spaniel and would sleep with her. "Dick" was a sly rascal and would steal out. One night last year he stole out, and the dogs finished him. His loss was very great, as I may never replace him. The Chicago Cat Club valued them at 1,000 dollars each. They were very anxious for me to come on with them for their cat shows, but I could not go. They were never on exhibition; as this is a small city, I feared they would be stolen. I have made every endeavour to get another mate for "Nellie" but have not been successful. I never allowed them to mate, as they were brother and sister, and I thought it might alter "Nellie's" beautiful form, which is round and handsome, with body rather long. In winter they have a light fur on back and ridge of tail, which falls off in warm weather. They stand the cold weather the same as other cats. They are not like the hairless dogs, whose hide is solid and tough; they are soft and delicate, with very loose skin.
"Nellie" has a very small head, large amber eyes, extra-long moustache and eyebrows; her voice now is a good baritone, when young it sounded exactly like a child's. They have great appetites and are quite dainty eaters - fried chicken and good steak is their choice. Have never been sick an hour. The enclosed faded picture is the only one I have at present - it is very lifelike, as it shows the wrinkles in its fine, soft skin. "Dick" was a very powerful cat; could whip any dog alone; his courage, no doubt, was the cause of his death. He always was the boss over our dogs. I have priced "Nellie" at 300 dollars. She is too valuable for me to keep in a small town. Many wealthy ladies would value her at her weight in gold if they knew what a very rare pet she is. I think in your position she would be a very good investment to exhibit at cat shows and other select events, as she doubtless is the only hairless cat now known. I have written to Old Mexico and all over this country without finding another. I would like to have her in some large museum where she would interest and be appreciated by thousands of people.
E. J. Shinick, Albuquerque, New Mexico, February 3, 1902  [3][4]
In Animal Life and the World of Nature (Vol 1, 1902-1903),[5] Mr. Shinick was quoted:
"Dick was a very powerful cat and could whip any dog alone; his courage no doubt was the cause of his death. He was a sly rascal and would steal out, and one night he got out and several dogs killed him. His loss was very great, and I may never replace him. The Chicago Cat Club valued him at 1,000 dollars. I have sent all over the country and endeavoured to get a mate for 'Nellie,' but I fear the breed is extinct".
Mr. Shinick's cats, acquired in 1894,[6]  were reported in the press as Aztec cats, the last of their kind.  At that time, distinctive non-pedigree cats were sometimes exhibited as curiosities or celebrities and their stories were displayed on their cages. It is conceivable that the story of a nearly extinct Aztec breed was invented to make random-bred hairless cats appear more exotic.
According to a report in The Albuquerque Citizen, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated Wednesday, May 6, 1903:
T. J. Shinick was about the last man to shake hands with the president (Roosevelt). . . . Shinick gave him a little present for his sick boy Archie. It was a large photo of Aztec cats raised by the Indians, and the only two hairless cats known in captivity. Both the President and Secretary Loeb was greatly pleased with the picture.[7]
The male cat, Dick, died in 1902 or 1903. In 1908, the female, Nellie, died. According to The New York Times of December 31, 1908:[8]
Cats and chickens were rivals for popular favor in Madison Square Garden yesterday, and the cats on the occasion, of the formal opening of the Atlantic Cat Club’s seventh annual 'Championship Show' had a shade the advantage. The opening of the cats’ part of the exhibition was attended by the announcement of the demise of the greatest feline curiosity of the show in transit from Albuquerque, N. M., to make her appearance as a metropolitan star. The deceased was the hairless cat which had aroused great Interest among the exhibitors as the Aztec cat. The animal was regarded as something more than a curiosity, because of the antiquity attributed to its species, and it was stated by Dr. Cecil French of the Atlantic Cat Club that with the consent of the owner, T. J. Shinick, the hairless body would be presented to the Museum of Natural History here and may be offered in evidence that the cat had a part in Aztec as well us in Egyptian civilisation. The Aztec cat's misfortune gave opportunity for understudies, however, and a tame lynx and a tame ocelot now are rivals for the quarters that the hairless cat will not occupy.
According to the New York Tribune, also of December 31, 1908,[9] “Death, too, has invaded the exhibit, for the Mexican hairless cat died on the way to the scene of her expected triumph. This cat, which was the property of Miss. L. Spink, of Big Lake, Minnesota, is said to be the last of a famous Aztec race.” The owner's name appears to be an error.
In The Albuquerque Journal of December 29, 1928 [10] (probably a reprint of an earlier article), it was reported, “T. J. Shinick, of this city, received a letter from Washington yesterday saying that the hairless cat, Nellie, which he sent to the national cat show, died of dropsy.” Dropsy is an accumulation of water in the soft tissues, which can be due to heart failure or, in cats, feline infectious peritonitis.
After that time, other randomly occurring hairless cats were also called (New) Mexican Hairless or Aztec cats. The term became generic instead of referring to the cats' location of origin.  Charles Henry Lane reported in his book "Rabbits, Cats and Cavies" (1903) [11]  that a Mexican Hairless Cat called "Jesuit" belonged to the Hon. Mrs. McLaren Morrison (a notable cat breeder and collector of rarities). This was the only specimen Mr. Lane had seen, and he believed it to be the only one ever exhibited in England. A portrait of the cat was included in his book. Jesuit could have been the result of another random mutation, because Nellie was considered by her caretaker as being too valuable to travel.
The San Francisco Chronicle, May 11, 1919[12] reported: “Dr. Cecil French of Washington owned perhaps the strangest pet feline of all – a hairless Aztec cat. On account of the great difference in climatic conditions between Washington and Mexico, the home of this feline curiosity, Dr. French housed ‘Moko,’ as his Aztec pet was known, in a glass case with regulated temperature.” It doesn't give the date when Dr. French owned a hairless cat, but 1919 is a decade after Nellie's death.
Interest in the hairless cats of New Mexico was revived by Mr. H.C. Brooke in 1926. His queries were printed in The Albuquerque Journal of January 12, 1926 and The El Paso Herald (Texas) of March 15, 1926. Mr. Brooke's letter read: "They were obtained from some Indians, and that the Jesuit Fathers thought they were the last survivors of an ancient Aztec breed. Most unfortunately, Mr. Shinick didn’t mate the pair, because they were brother and sister, and apparently did not preserve the bodies on death."[13][14]
Mr. Shinick's daughter, Mrs. Michael Palladino, replied in a letter to The Albuquerque Journal on January 14, 1926: According to Mrs. Palladino, her father had two of the hairless cats, a male and a female. He intended to mate them, but the male was stolen. The female he kept until she was about 13 years old, then sent her to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. She died soon after arriving in Washington, and Mrs. Palladino said the body was mounted for display in the museum. Mrs. Palladino believed that was in December 1909. She did not know where her father obtained the cats.[15]
The Montana Butte Standard, December 26, 1937 reported "Mexican hairless cats are supposedly extinct, a specimen is owned in New Mexico, says Mr. Crawford, and there may be others," but this claim was not substantiated.[16]
On March 20, 1956, The Albuquerque Journal printed another request for information:
John White, head of the department of information of the state extension service and the Experiment Station at New Mexico A&M College, has a letter from an El Pasoan who wants information on what is called the Mexican, and sometimes New Mexico, hairless cat. White is stumped. So are the others in the department. The El Paso man first wrote to Mexico City College, Mexico City, for information. The college apparently told him the animal was mouse-colored and the underparts were pinkish. The animal also has a ridge of fur along the back and upper surface of the tail. Mexico City College advised the El Pasoan to write to New Mexico A&M. Many know of the Mexican hairless dog, but, says white, if anyone has seen a New Mexico Hairless cat, or knows there is such an animal, he’d like to hear about it.[17]
Mrs. Palladino replied in The Albuquerque Journal, April 3, 1956 that her father, the late Thomas J. Shinick, had given her two hairless Mexican cats as pets in approximately 1894. She named them Dick and Nellie, and owned them for several years. One morning Dick didn't come home, and the family told her that the milkman had stolen him.  When Nellie was about 15 years old, her father decided that because hairless cats were so rare, the Smithsonian Institution might be interested. Officials of the institution requested to see the cat Nellie.  Mrs. Palladino said Nellie had arrived in Washington in good condition, but died a month later, after which she was exhibited as a taxidermy specimen.[18]
This indicates that the Mexican Hairless, or Aztec, breed was a pair of hairless siblings given a fictionalized account of their origin and the romantic suggestion that they were the last of their breed. The term Mexican Hairless Cat became a generic term for any hairless cat until 1931 when hairless kittens were born to ordinary furred cats in France and were exhibited by Professor E. Letard.[19]

We’ve all heard of the Sphynx, yes? You know, the classic hairless cat that steals the show everywhere they go? But did you know that there is another hairless cat breed that is thought to precede the Sphynx?

7–14 pounds
Lifespan:
8–14 years
Colors:
Cream/brown/gray skin (hairless)
Suitable for:
Active families, homes with multiple pets or children
Temperament:
Affectionate, curious, intelligent, friendly, energetic
The Mexican Hairless Cat is also known as the Aztec Cat or the New Mexican Hairless Cat. While rumors are flying of possibly revamping of the breed—they are all just whispers in the wind. Here’s what we know and think about the Mexican Hairless Cat in this article.

The Mexican Hairless Cat was first documented in 1902 by Mr. E.J. Shinick, who owned a pair of hairless cats, a male and a female. Mr. Shinick lived in New Mexico, and he supposedly got the cats from local Native Americans of the Pueblo tribe and was told that they were the last remaining ancient cats of the Aztecs.
Although these weren’t the only hairless cats in America at the time, they were well known because of their origins and the mystery surrounding them.

A post shared by Shania | England, UK🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (@shanias.critters)

The Mexican Hairless Cat gained popularity after word got out that these cats were the last of a hairless Aztec breed. The press got wind of the cats, and since hairless cats were an oddity at the time and the cats didn’t have a pedigree, they quickly became a curiosity among the general public.
They were called Mexican Hairless Cats, New Mexican Hairless Cats, and Aztec Cats due to their mysterious origins. However, it is unclear whether these cats really were the last of an Aztec breed, or if that was a story that was told in order to make them seem more exotic when they were really just the result of a random genetic mutation like other hairless cats.
Unfortunately, Mr. Shinick never bred his two cats, and the cats had both passed by 1908. So, if these really were an Aztec breed, that was the last of them.
However, other hairless cats were born due to a natural genetic mutation, and eventually hairless cats were bred intentionally, with the Sphynx breed originating in 1966 due to selectively breeding a natural-born hairless cat with a domestic shorthair, and then breeding that offspring with other hairless cats to ensure more genetic diversity in the breed. Hairless cats are still super popular today, even if they aren’t Mexican Hairless Cats.
Although there are rumors around the web that people are trying to revitalize the Mexican Hairless cat, no solid evidence has really come up that this was even a distinct breed. Some cat fanciers may have tried to revitalize or recreate the breed, but nothing has been openly successful, and any attempts to revive it are mostly just speculation.
The Mexican Hairless Cat might not be around these days, but they certainly paved the way for the other hairless cuties we know and love. Breeds like the Sphynx, Bambino, and Peterbald allow you to have a similar breed to the Mexican Hairless Cat, and these breeds have been well-researched and genetically tested to ensure that they will be around for a long time.

It makes sense when you think about it, since these cats don’t have a coat of fur to protect them. As such, you have to keep a sweater or some other kind of sun protection on them to prevent sunburn as well as keep their skin wiped down to keep it clean and moisturized. If you’re interested in owning one of these cats, speak to your vet about how to care for their skin, and never use human sunscreen on a cat.
Even though they are called hairless cats, some of them actually have a very thin layer of light-colored hair, or “fuzz.” This layer will often be white or gray in color. But they still require special care for their skin even if they have a thin coat of hair.

Hairless cats are often marketed as being better for people with allergies due to the fact that they don’t shed. However, cat allergies are due to a protein found in a cat’s dander, saliva, and urine, so a cat can still trigger allergies even if they don’t have fur, and no cat is 100% hypoallergenic. But a hairless cat is still a good choice if you don’t want cat hair everywhere.

Owning a hairless cat might be very different from the regular felines you’re used to. You might not have ever even met someone who owns a hairless cat, and it’s simply the idea of them that piques your interest. We don’t blame you!
Hairless cats certainly are unique specimens. However, there are two sides to everything and there are downfalls to owning a hairless cat just as there are benefits. Here are some of them now, but we definitely recommend that you read up on different hairless cat breeds before committing to make sure you are well-informed.

Hairless cats are pretty cool, if we do say so ourselves. They have a one of the kind appearance and definitely put a new spin on cat ownership.
Hairless cats tend to be very friendly and outgoing. They make the best candidates for people who have frequent visitors. Inquisitive and eager to learn, most hairless cats are the life of the party. They are real brainiacs capable of learning simple to complex concepts. They can be leash and command trained.
Hairless cats make amazing companion animals to almost any living situation. They get along very well with cats and dogs—as long as they are socialized properly. With mannerly kids, hairless cats also quite enjoy the company and exuberance of children—they love to play!
Hairless cats are known for their numerous health issues. A majority of cases involved some type of gastrointestinal upset, as these cats are notoriously sensitive.
If you’ve ever seen the price of hairless cats, you know it’s definitely not a cheap number! These cats are pricey! A Sphynx alone can cost upwards of $6,000 for a healthy bloodline. If you get a specialized cat like the Munchkin Sphynx mix, also known as the Bambino, you might even pay more than that!

Now you understand that the Mexican Hairless Cat is a breed that was thought to stem from ancient Aztec cats. However, the breed simply didn’t survive through the years and is thought to be extinct. Instead, we have other hairless cats today that have totally stolen the show.
Of all the things you learned about hairless cats, what fact was your favorite?

Have you ever heard about the Mexican cat breed, also known as the Mexican Hairless cat?
You probably haven’t, or you might think that it’s one of those new exotic cat breeds.
Well, keep on reading to find out more about these hairless cats, where they come from, and what they’re like.
When I say “hairless,” most of you think about Sphynx cats.
However, the Sphynx isn’t the only hairless cat breed in the world, just the one that makes the news.
Besides the Sphynx, other hairless breeds include the Bambino, Peterbald, Donskoy, and Ukrainian Levkoy.
But it all comes back to the Mexican hairless cat.
Don’t feel bad if you’ve never heard about the Mexican cat breed or seen cute pictures of it.
It’s a supposedly extinct breed that was documented in the early years of the 20th century.
One of the earliest reports of hairless cats dates back to 1878, when two kittens were born to a short-haired cat.
While they were a novelty, their appearance didn’t cause much of a sensation. However, in 1902, hairless cats made the news.
As the story goes, the Pueblo people gave two hairless kittens to a couple from New Mexico. The Puebloans claimed that the kittens were the last of an ancient Aztec cat breed.
Mr. Shinick, the owner of the cats, said that the cats were littermates and that they were smaller than the local short-haired cats.
He described that the cats would grow fur on their backs and tails during the winter and that the female, Nellie, had long eyebrows and whiskers.
The owner also mentioned that the cats liked to sleep beneath the bed covers and that they were some of the most affectionate cats he had ever seen.
Per his word, the cats seemed to understand almost everything he said, and they were always warm to the touch.
Unfortunately, the male, Dick, died quite young after a confrontation with dogs. Nellie, the female, lived to be 15 years old.
Apparently, her body was preserved in the Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington until it was lost.
Since the two cats were littermates, Mr. Shinick never attempted to breed them, and there were no hairless kittens born to continue this ancient Aztec breed.
Due to the popularity of these two hairless felines, people used the names Mexican Hairless Cat, New Mexican Hairless Cat, and Aztec Cat to describe them.
That practice continued until the 1930s, when a French cat gave birth to hairless kittens.
How much of that story is true is hard to say. Likely, the Aztec part of the story was invented to make the cats sound exotic and attract the attention of the public.
But stories about hairless cats go back to Aztec times, so the Aztecs might have had such cats.
Since Mexican hairless cats were a rare event, people didn’t make any conscious efforts to mate with them until the 1960s.
It all happened when a hairless kitten (Prune) was born in Toronto to a black and white shorthair cat.
The owner fell in love with the appearance of the kitten and decided to reproduce Prune and mate him with his mother.
Later on, another cat breeder from Ontario found three hairless kittens abandoned on the streets and sent them to the Netherlands.
These kittens were bred successfully to a Devon Rex. Wadena, Minnesota, greatly contributed to the hairless cats’ breeding program.
Milt and Ethelyn Pearson noticed that their domestic shorthair cats often had hairless kittens. They sold some of these kittens to breeders who crossed them with Cornish Rex.
It wasn’t easy in the beginning because the gene pool was tiny and the breeders had very little information about the genetics of these hairless cats.
Unfortunately, a lot of kittens didn’t survive, and some had severe health problems.
However, the breeders’ efforts paid off, and the new breed was known at first as the Canadian Hairless Cat, not the Mexican hairless.
Later on, these unique cats were given the name Sphynx after the impressive Egyptian statue and the mythical creature from Greek legends.
Sphynx cats aren’t completely hairless. They have very short, fuzzy hair, and that’s why they look bald.
What causes it is a mutation in a gene called keratin 71 (KRT71).
This gene is responsible for producing hair follicles, and its mutation damages the structure of the cat’s fur.
While hair can still form, it falls easily. That’s why Sphynx cats have short, fuzzy hair instead of a short/long coat.
The Sphinx’s mutated gene is close to the one that determines the Devon Rex’s short coat and the curly fur of the Selkirk Rex.
That’s why breeders were able to produce hairless kittens by crossing them with Devon Rex. It’s also a recessive gene, which means that it’s inferior to the other hair genes.
That’s why you might have furry kittens if you breed the Sphynx with other breeds (not that you should try it).
Buying a Hairless Mexican cat costs between $75-$100, whereas buying one from a breeder can be as much as $1,000.
No matter what hairless cat you have at home, caring for such cats is slightly different than caring for normal, furry ones.
For once, hairless cats are prone to chills because they don’t have short or thick coats to protect them from the elements.
You’ll need to maintain their body temperature, dress them up, or provide heating blankets in winter. Besides being sensitive to cold, Sphynx cats also easily overheat.
As such, you have to keep an eye on them on hot and humid days and keep them cool.
The lack of fur also means that hairless cats can burn in the sun and have more sensitive skin than ordinary cats.
Moreover, hairless cats require even more grooming than some long-haired ones. That’s because you have to bathe your cat often, or they get smelly.
You also have to dry them thoroughly to prevent bacteria overgrowth, feed them high-quality food, trim their nails, clean their ears, and wash between the toes.
It’s a lot of work, so consider yourself warned. You also have to keep in mind that purebred cats, such as the Sphynx, are prone to some diseases.
As such, you should get your cat from a respectable breeder who tests for hereditary conditions.
If you’re thinking about getting any hairless cats, you should know that a lack of fur doesn’t mean that the cat is hypoallergenic.
It’s the amount of danger that triggers allergies, not how much fluff they have. So, the Sphynx might not be the best cat breed for people with allergies.
It’s funny to think that people who used to practice human sacrifices bred and took care of hairless cats hundreds of years ago.
And while Mexican Hairless cats might be extinct, they’ve inspired people to create the Sphynx and other hairless cat breeds.

The Mexican Hairless Cat is often known as the Aztec Cat or the New Mexican Hairless Cat. Whereas rumors are flying of probably revamping of the breed—they’re all simply whispers within the wind. Right here’s what we all know and take into consideration the Mexican Hairless Cat on this article.
Vitality

A high-energy cat wants lots of bodily and psychological stimulation to maintain wholesome and joyful, whereas a low-energy cat wants minimal bodily exercise, however nonetheless wants psychological stimulation. When selecting a cat, It’s essential to make sure their power ranges match your life-style.

Cats which might be easy-to-train are extra keen and expert at rapidly studying prompts and actions with minimal coaching. Tougher-to-train cats are often extra cussed or aloof and require a bit extra endurance and observe.
Well being
+
Sure cat breeds are extra inclined to numerous genetic well being issues, and a few greater than others. This doesn’t imply that each cat in these breeds may have these points, however they do have an elevated threat, so it’s essential to grasp and put together for any further wants they could require.
Lifespan

Some cat breeds are extra social than others, each in direction of people and different cats and animals. Cats which might be extra social generally tend to rub up on strangers for scratches or soar on laps for cuddles, whereas cats which might be much less social shrink back, cover, are extra cautious, and even probably aggressive. Regardless of the breed or gender, it’s essential to socialize your cat and expose them to many various conditions.


The Mexican Hairless Cat was first documented in 1902 by Mr. E.J. Shinick, who owned a pair of hairless cats, a male and a feminine. Mr. Shinick lived in New Mexico, and he supposedly obtained the cats from native Native People of the Pueblo tribe and was advised that they have been the final remaining historic cats of the Aztecs.
Though these weren’t the one hairless cats in America on the time, they have been well-known due to their origins and the thriller surrounding them.
The Mexican Hairless Cat gained recognition after phrase obtained out that these cats have been the final of a hairless Aztec breed. The press obtained wind of the cats, and since hairless cats have been an oddity on the time and the cats didn’t have a pedigree, they rapidly turned a curiosity among the many basic public.
They have been known as Mexican Hairless Cats, New Mexican Hairless Cats, and Aztec Cats as a consequence of their mysterious origins. Nevertheless, it’s unclear whether or not these cats actually have been the final of an Aztec breed, or if that was a narrative that was advised with a view to make them appear extra unique after they have been actually simply the results of a random genetic mutation like different hairless cats.
Sadly, Mr. Shinick by no means bred his two cats, and the cats had each handed by 1908. So, if these actually have been an Aztec breed, that was the final of them.
Nevertheless, different hairless cats have been born as a consequence of a pure genetic mutation, and finally hairless cats have been bred deliberately, with the Sphynx breed originating in 1966 as a consequence of selectively breeding a natural-born hairless cat with a home shorthair, after which breeding that offspring with different hairless cats to make sure extra genetic variety within the breed. Hairless cats are nonetheless tremendous fashionable at this time, even when they aren’t Mexican Hairless Cats.
Though there are rumors across the net that individuals are making an attempt to revitalize the Mexican Hairless cat, no strong proof has actually come up that this was even a definite breed. Some cat fanciers might have tried to revitalize or recreate the breed, however nothing has been brazenly profitable, and any makes an attempt to revive it are largely simply hypothesis.
The Mexican Hairless Cat may not be round as of late, however they definitely paved the way in which for the opposite hairless cuties we all know and love. Breeds just like the Sphynx, Bambino, and Peterbald let you have the same breed to the Mexican Hairless Cat, and these breeds have been well-researched and genetically examined to make sure that they are going to be round for a very long time.

It is smart when you concentrate on it, since these cats don’t have a coat of fur to guard them. As such, you must hold a sweater or another form of solar safety on them to forestall sunburn in addition to hold their pores and skin wiped all the way down to hold it clear and moisturized. For those who’re fascinated by proudly owning certainly one of these cats, communicate to your vet about  care for his or her pores and skin, and by no means use human sunscreen on a cat.
Despite the fact that they’re known as hairless cats, a few of them even have a really skinny layer of light-colored hair, or “fuzz.” This layer will usually be white or grey in colour. However they nonetheless require particular care for his or her pores and skin even when they’ve a skinny coat of hair.
Hairless cats are sometimes marketed as being higher for folks with allergic reactions as a consequence of the truth that they don’t shed.

Energy
+
A high-energy cat needs a lot of physical and mental stimulation to keep healthy and happy, while a low-energy cat needs minimal physical activity, but still needs mental stimulation. When choosing a cat, It’s important to ensure their energy levels match your lifestyle.
Trainability
+
Cats that are easy-to-train are more willing and skilled at quickly learning prompts and actions with minimal training. Harder-to-train cats are usually more stubborn or aloof and require a bit more patience and practice.
Health
+
Certain cat breeds are more prone to various genetic health problems, and some more than others. This doesn’t mean that every cat in those breeds will have these issues, but they do have an increased risk, so it’s important to understand and prepare for any additional needs they may require.
Lifespan
+
Due to their size or potential genetic health issues of a specific breed, some cats have shorter lifespans than others. Proper nutrition, exercise, mental stimulation, and hygiene also play an important role in your cat’s lifespan and quality of life.
Sociability
+
Some cat breeds are more social than others, both towards humans and other cats and animals. Cats that are more social have a tendency to rub up on strangers for scratches or jump on laps for cuddles, while cats that are less social shy away, hide, are more cautious, and even potentially aggressive. No matter the breed or gender, it’s important to socialize your cat and expose them to many different situations.


The Mexican Hairless Cat was first documented in 1902 by Mr. E.J. Shinick, who owned a pair of hairless cats, a male and a female. Mr. Shinick lived in New Mexico, and he supposedly got the cats from local Native Americans of the Pueblo tribe and was told that they were the last remaining ancient cats of the Aztecs.
Although these weren’t the only hairless cats in America at the time, they were well known because of their origins and the mystery surrounding them.
The Mexican Hairless Cat gained popularity after word got out that these cats were the last of a hairless Aztec breed. The press got wind of the cats, and since hairless cats were an oddity at the time and the cats didn’t have a pedigree, they quickly became a curiosity among the general public.
They were called Mexican Hairless Cats, New Mexican Hairless Cats, and Aztec Cats due to their mysterious origins. However, it is unclear whether these cats really were the last of an Aztec breed, or if that was a story that was told in order to make them seem more exotic when they were really just the result of a random genetic mutation like other hairless cats.
Unfortunately, Mr. Shinick never bred his two cats, and the cats had both passed by 1908. So, if these really were an Aztec breed, that was the last of them.
However, other hairless cats were born due to a natural genetic mutation, and eventually hairless cats were bred intentionally, with the Sphynx breed originating in 1966 due to selectively breeding a natural-born hairless cat with a domestic shorthair, and then breeding that offspring with other hairless cats to ensure more genetic diversity in the breed. Hairless cats are still super popular today, even if they aren’t Mexican Hairless Cats.
Although there are rumors around the web that people are trying to revitalize the Mexican Hairless cat, no solid evidence has really come up that this was even a distinct breed. Some cat fanciers may have tried to revitalize or recreate the breed, but nothing has been openly successful, and any attempts to revive it are mostly just speculation.
The Mexican Hairless Cat might not be around these days, but they certainly paved the way for the other hairless cuties we know and love. Breeds like the Sphynx, Bambino, and Peterbald allow you to have a similar breed to the Mexican Hairless Cat, and these breeds have been well-researched and genetically tested to ensure that they will be around for a long time.


It makes sense when you think about it, since these cats don’t have a coat of fur to protect them. As such, you have to keep a sweater or some other kind of sun protection on them to prevent sunburn as well as keep their skin wiped down to keep it clean and moisturized. If you’re interested in owning one of these cats, speak to your vet about how to care for their skin, and never use human sunscreen on a cat.
Even though they are called hairless cats, some of them actually have a very thin layer of light-colored hair, or “fuzz.” This layer will often be white or gray in color. But they still require special care for their skin even if they have a thin coat of hair.
Hairless cats are often marketed as being better for people with allergies due to the fact that they don’t shed. However, cat allergies are due to a protein found in a cat’s dander, saliva, and urine, so a cat can still trigger allergies even if they don’t have fur, and no cat is 100% hypoallergenic. But a hairless cat is still a good choice if you don’t want cat hair everywhere.
