Scotties are known to be intelligent self-starters with a strong work ethic, family-oriented social nature, and strong loyalty. Decidedly not low-energy couch potatoes, the Scottish Terrier makes a great watchful companion for families with older kids, seniors, or singles. Let’s learn some more about this animatedly aristocratic breed down below.

Scottish Terriers are less numerous than they once were but still popular enough that you shouldn’t have too hard a time finding one. The Scottish Terrier Club of America is the official kennel club for the breed where you can learn about the breed and possibly make connections with owners who can give references to reputable breeders.
You should do your homework when searching for a Scottish Terrier breeder because crossbreeds with the Scottie are becoming very popular. Shifty, disreputable breeders will gladly pass off a Scottie mix as purebred if they can. Just make sure that you’re purchasing from a reputable breeder before bringing one of these dogs home.
The modern Scottish Terrier is related to the West Highland White Terrier and is also thought to be related to an old breed called the Skye Terrier (not the modern Skye, either). A very old breed, the oldest depictions of the Scottie go back to the 17th century. They were very popular in England after King James VI became enamored with them, but they’ve recently declined as crosses of the Scottish become more popular among dog owners.

This breed is marked by their intelligence just as much as their courage. Scottish Terriers are more partners than pets, and that makes them delightful dogs for the right family. Some Scotties are said to know the difference between their family’s footsteps and a stranger’s. If you’re looking for a spirited family companion with a mind of their own, the Scottish Terrier could be the right dog for you.
Scottish Terriers are known to bond closely with their family and some can even be one-person dogs. They’re not the best small breed for families with young children, sadly, because they’re not very tolerant of shenanigans. At worst, they could bite when poked and prodded without supervision. They can be a great companion for singles, families with kids, or seniors as well. What’s important is that Scotties get enough human time because they thrive with their people even if they don’t show it.
This breed can be a little overbearing with other dogs, and the Scottish Terrier may even attempt to dominate larger dogs! Early socialization helps mellow them out a little bit, but they’re still best suited for dog-only households. Scotties are happy to terrorize or chase cats, and their high prey drive makes them potentially fatal for small prey pets, like hamsters or rabbits.

Scottish Terriers might be little dogs, but they still need the best quality nutrition. The AKC says that Scotties do well with dog food containing mid-20% protein, but they’ll need more when they’re puppies. A good puppy kibble will offer everything they need to grow up strong and healthy. A complete and balanced diet will also have healthy carbs, fats to help produce energy, and a bunch of vitamins/minerals that help promote healthy organ development and function.
Scottish Terriers appreciate a well-rounded meal with ingredients like meat, veggies, and occasionally fruit, even if they get everything they need from a good kibble. You can offer them some lean meat like beef, turkey, lamb, or chicken daily with no ill effects. Veggies should be in moderate amounts, opting for fiber and vitamin-rich choices like sweet potato, carrots, broccoli, kale, and spinach. Leafy greens in particular are good for Scotties and are known to delay their risk of developing bladder cancer. However, any human foods should be offered as rare treats, unless you’ve had their homemade diet cleared by a pet nutritionist.
Scottish Terriers are an active but little dog that’s easily satisfied with half an hour to an hour of exercise every day, but that’s not all! Scotties are inquisitive and excel at athletic pursuits when they put their mind to them. Specifically, they’re great at Earthdog digging and agility courses where they can best show off their skills in a controlled but independent setting. Scotties are notorious diggers who will find a way to satisfy their natural instinct to dig, so some folks recommend having a designated digging zone for them to do their thing where it won’t do any harm.
Mental stimulation keeps the Scottish Terrier engaged without being destructive, and bored Scotties are known to turn to digging or chewing to vent their frustrations. Give them enough toys to keep them occupied during downtime, and consider mental games or interactive toys like snuffle mats to tap into their love for digging.
Scottish Terriers are hard to train for first-time dog owners because they were bred to work apart from their owners in the field. Less eager to please than other breeds, you have to work with the Scottie on their own terms to an extent. It helps a lot if you find a treat they love to incentivize training and to use as positive reinforcement. Scotties give out their trust sparingly, and it can take some time to build a solid bond with them.
Scottish Terriers have a unique wire coat that requires periodic stripping to keep the coat in sleek, clean condition. If you don’t want to do this yourself, a dog groomer would be happy to assist with the task. Otherwise, the Scottie doesn’t shed a ton, and you can brush them once a week to keep the worst of the hair off your furniture. Baths should be fairly sparse—every 2 months should do the trick unless your Scottie gets visibly dirty. Use a gentle shampoo with nourishing ingredients.
Most Scottish Terriers are healthy dogs that live to 12 years or older, but the breed is predisposed to develop certain health problems more often than other dogs. Good breeders have health screenings done to detect health problems, but such screenings can’t rule out all health problems. Let’s look at the most common health problems for the Scotties so you can be more aware of what health issues they may face later in life.
Minor Conditions:
Serious Conditions:

The main difference between male and female Scottish Terriers is their size. Males are a little bigger at 21 to 22 pounds, while females may only grow to 19 or 20 pounds. Every dog has their own vivid and unique personality, and there’s no real personality difference between the sexes.

The delightfully spunky Scottish Terrier has won over some of the most famous people in recent history. Just a few famous people who have owned them include US Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and George W. Bush, Queen Victoria, Shirley Temple, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, and Eva Braun.
They might be called the Scottish Terrier, but they’re really just one of Scotland’s five native terrier breeds. The others are the modern Skye Terrier, Cairn Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier. The Scotties themselves are more closely related to the West Highland White Terrier than any of the others.
Scotties are famously vocal dogs that naturally settle into the watchdog role at home. Unlike some other small breeds, the Scottish Terrier has a surprisingly deep bark that can dissuade potential intruders all on its own. They can quickly descend into nuisance barking without proper training.

Scottish Terriers aren’t as popular as they used to be, but their rugged can-do attitude and loyal nature make the Scottie a perfect watchdog for almost any family. They require some grooming to stay presentable and can give you trouble during training, but once you click, the Scottish Terrier is a spectacular addition to your family.

The Scottish Terrier, affectionately known as the Scottie, has a long and storied history that reaches back over 500 years. Originating from Scotland (as their name suggests), these hardy dogs were bred to hunt small game such as badgers, foxes, and rabbits. One of the oldest terrier breeds, their exact ancestry is largely untraceable, but it's believed they share a common lineage with other Scottish terriers, such as the Skye, Cairn, and West Highland White Terriers.

The peak of popularity for this breed was the 1930s and early 1940s, when iconic Hollywood stars like Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis owned Scotties. The Scottie also became popularized when it was associated with Depression-era knickknacks and advertising.
Scottish Terriers are generally healthy, but may suffer from Scotty Cramp, cerebellar abiotrophy, patellar luxation, ligneous membranitis, von Willebrand Disease (a blood clotting disorder), and chondrodystrophy (with or without chondrodysplasia). They are also predisposed to a genetic condition called craniomandibular osteopathy, which causes excessive bone growth in the jaw.
Scotties are known for their independent, confident, and spirited temperament. While they can be somewhat reserved with strangers, they are typically affectionate and loyal to their families. These dogs are intelligent, but their stubborn streak can make training a challenge. Early socialization is important for this breed to prevent them from becoming overly suspicious or aggressive toward strangers and other animals.Scottish Terriers are energetic dogs that require regular exercise to keep them fit and to prevent boredom. However, their hunting background means they have a high prey drive, and they should always be kept on a leash or in a secure area to prevent them from chasing after small animals.
Scottish Terriers have won the Westminster Dog Show Best in Show more than any other breed except for the Wire Fox Terrier.They are sometimes referred to as a "Diehard" due to their determined and robust nature. This nickname was first used by George, the fourth Earl of Dumbarton, for his pack of incredibly brave Scottie dogs in the 17th century.They're famous for their distinctive silhouette, characterized by their bearded face, bushy eyebrows, erect ears, and a tail that stands up like an antenna.Scottish Terriers were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885, and they have been a popular breed in the United States since the 1930s. Two of the most famous Scotties were Fala, owned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Barney, owned by President George W. Bush. Two Scottish Terriers named Caacie and Telek were also owned by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Height:
10 – 11 inches
Weight:
18 – 22 pounds
Lifespan:
11 – 13 years
Colors:
Black, brindle, black brindle, red brindle, silver brindle, wheaten
Suitable for:
Active families without small children, elderly or those who are looking for companionship, those looking for a low-shedding dog, homes without pools
Temperament:
Stubborn, Independent, Confident, Dignified, Smart, Loyal, Alert
Many of us had our first experience with the Scottish Terrier in Walt Disney’s Lady and the Tramp. Jock the Scottish Terrier was Lady’s mentor and protector throughout the film, and he had a certain dignified air about him.
That being said, their independent streak does not always allow for them to seek out great deals of praise and attention. And as a Scottie parent, you may find that they prefer time alone more than anything else.

There are definitely a few considerations you need to think about before getting a Scottish Terrier. While they’re a deeply loyal breed, they may show preferential treatment and respect to particular family members.
There are many stories where a Scottie will be over-protective of a certain family member, even nipping at those who come too close. They are among the nippiest of pups, especially if they feel threatened, uncomfortable, or bothered.
This is why we don’t recommend picking up a Scottie Dog if you have small children. There are many times when smaller children take things a bit too far when it comes to playing with dogs. And the Scottish Terrier won’t tolerate it as much as a Golden Retriever or an American Bully.
Their independent and often defiant streak also makes them much more difficult to train than other dogs. And that’s because they were originally bred to work on their own terms, digging through burrowing animal dens. Scottish Terriers can also be prolific barkers. They’re set to defend their territory and master at all costs, and they’re not afraid to let you know.
Another thing to keep in mind is their love for water. Scotties have been known to just love wading around in puddles and small pools. But due to their physical build, they aren’t swimmers. Their short legs and dense bodies cause them to sink too fast. If you own a pool that remains uncovered, you’ll need to be extra careful and monitor your pup around it.
Also, due to their original backgrounds, they’re diggers. No way around it. What’s best is to allow them a designated digging zone somewhere in the yard to let them get it out of their systems. And if you’re feeling really froggy, go fill their holes back in after and let them start again.
However, these traits don’t mean that the Scottish Terrier isn’t a great dog breed. In fact, they’re one of the best companion dogs around. These are just a few things you should think about depending on your home life and situation.
Scotties are notorious barkers, especially towards strangers or individuals they feel uneasy about. And as a matter of fact, they are often ranked right alongside German Shepherds and Rottweilers in alarm barking.
The first Earl of Dumbarton, George Douglas, once owned an exceptionally fierce and brave pack of Scotties that would ride into battle with him. They were nicknamed “Diehards”—a moniker still held by the pups today.  But not only were the dogs called diehards, but the name spread to the entire Royal Scots regiment.
These dogs were first bred in Aberdeen, Scotland in the 1700s and were meant to chase den animals around the area. It wasn’t until the late 1800s until they were formally recognized as Scottish Terriers.
Just because the Scottie has a few personality quirks doesn’t mean they’re not that bright. As a matter of fact, they’re actually extremely intelligent. And that’s what makes them a bit more difficult to handle. They like to do things their way. And while they’ll still love you, they’re just going to do it their way. This could mean being loving and playful. Or it could just mean staring at you from across the room. Each case and personality is different with the Scottish Terrier.
Scottie Dogs can make good family dogs despite their quirks. For a Scottie, it’s not about you adopting them into your home — it’s about them taking you on as their people. And once that happens, they’re fiercely loyal to the end. The biggest concern would be with smaller children. Scotties do have a tendency to nip when they are put in uncomfortable positions.
If raised alongside another dog, there will be zero issues at all. The Scottie would simply accept that dog as family. However, introducing a new dog needs to be done gently. Once your Scottish Terrier has accepted the new dog’s place in the family, there are little to no issues. And they may really enjoy having a new playmate!
But that’s with other dogs. Scottish Terriers have extremely high prey drives. Cats, rodents, or other pets may become targets of unwarranted aggression for your Scottie — so be sure to keep an eye on this.

Now that we’ve got their quirks out of the way, let’s talk about the basics. You’ll need to know just how much food, exercise, and grooming your Scottie is going to need in order to be a successful parent.
Scotties are big dogs only at heart, which means they only require a smaller amount of food. Feeding them 1-1.5 cups of high-quality dry food per day should be sufficient to keep them full and energized. It’s important not to overfeed your Scottie in order to prevent obesity.
Scottish Terriers have high energy levels, but they’re easily batted down with a short walk or some good playtime. They don’t need as long of an exercise period because of how they’re built. A simple walk around the block may just whet another breed’s appetite for exercise. However, the same walk may tire a Scottie right out.
The key to training a Scottie is to start early and adapt throughout the process. Their independent streak can make them exceptionally difficult to train. However, by starting young and adapting to processes that actually work, you can make some serious headway.
Also, you need to start socializing your Scottish Terrier at an early age as well. The older they get, the more grumpy and stubborn they get. And that makes it much more difficult to socialize or train.
Scottish Terriers require special grooming considerations. They tend to have sensitive skin, so bathing should only really be done when necessary. And their double layer coat requires constant grooming. Some owners recommend a weekly grooming including haircut — and that’s just for family dogs! Show dogs may need daily grooming.
This is because their coat doesn’t stop growing, and it grows very quickly. But that’s good news for those looking for a low-shedding dog. Since their hair keeps growing, it doesn’t tend to fall out or shed as much when compared to other dogs.
All in all, Scottish Terriers are a generally healthy breed. However, there are a few ailments that tend to show up more often than others.
Serious conditions to look out for include von Willebrand’s Disease and craniomandibular osteopathy. The former is an inherited blood disease that affects the dog’s blood’s ability to clot. This could mean simple cuts or surgeries can become complicated. However, this trait is often isolated from the breeding pool. Craniomandibular osteopathy normally only happens during the first year of life and is often outgrown as the dog matures. This is where the skull bones of the puppy become abnormally enlarged during the growing process.
Scotties also have their very own ailment called the Scottie cramp. This only happens when the dog is stressed or overstimulated. Their muscles will flex out in certain positions in these situations making movement difficult. However, Scotties with this disorder generally live long healthy lives.
There are no real discernable characteristics between males and females other than sex. Males may be slightly larger and consume more food than females who aren’t pregnant. But other than that, Scotties are quite similar between the sexes.

The Scottish Terrier is a feisty, yet stoic breed that believes no challenge is too big. And the air of dignity in which this pup holds themselves is second-to-none.
However, they are an amazing companion and deeply loyal to their owners and family. So, if you’re looking for a new addition to your family and can handle the eccentricities of this breed, a Scottie Dog might be a great option for you.

If you've opened your home to a Scottish Terrier, commonly referred to as a Scottie, then you already know you're in for a vibrant life with a dog full of personality. From their robust build to their undeniable intelligence, Scotties make wonderful companions for the right owners. Here's everything you need to know about your unique furry friend.

Scotties are not without their challenges. They respond poorly to harsh training methods and are better suited to positive reinforcement techniques. Their inquisitive nature and strong prey drive make them prone to chasing smaller animals, and they can be wary of strangers. Digging is a favorite pastime, and their independent nature means they often have a mind of their own.
Originally bred in Scotland for vermin control and hunting, Scotties have a rich history. They gained international prominence in the late 19th century and have the unique distinction of being the chosen breed of three U.S. Presidents. While their feisty nature may make them less suitable for homes with small children or other pets, their loyalty and intelligence make them a cherished member of many households.
Scottish Terriers are generally robust dogs with a lifespan of 12-15 years. While they're a hearty breed, like all dogs, they have their specific health concerns, so regular vet check-ups are crucial.
So, is a Scottish Terrier the right dog for you? If you're looking for a spirited, intelligent, and intensely loyal companion—and you're prepared to meet her needs for mental and physical stimulation—then the answer is a resounding yes. With the right care and training, your Scottie will be a cherished member of your family for years to come.

If your fur baby seems to be more sluggish, drinks water like it's going out of style, and has a sudden appetite that could rival a teenage boy, don't dismiss these signs! They could point to a common issue in dogs, especially among Diehards—cushings disease. This condition affects the adrenal glands, making them produce an excess of steroid hormone. It's a slow creeper, so it's easy to miss the early symptoms. As it progresses, you may notice your pup developing a potbelly and thinning skin. Treatment usually consists of oral medications, so you'll want to be in close coordination with your vet for the perfect dosage. Early detection and treatment can go a long way!
When it comes to a dog's well-being, their eyes play a starring role. Sadly, Scottish Terriers are susceptible to various eye issues that could lead to blindness or be downright painful. Cataracts, for instance, can cloud the eyes and cause blindness over time, but many dogs adapt well, and there are surgical options to restore vision. Another condition, Distichiasis, features extra hairs growing inside the eyelid, leading to chronic eye pain. It sounds like an annoying eyelash, but way worse! Then, there’s Persistent Pupillary Membrane, which isn't usually a big problem but can be if unlucky. Regular eye checks will help to catch and treat these issues before they get out of paw.
Blood clotting disorders are particularly challenging because they often go unnoticed until a crisis occurs—like surgery or severe injury. Scottish Terriers are more likely than most dogs to inherit Von Willebrand's Disease, which affects blood clotting. To be on the safe side, vets usually conduct specific DNA blood tests before any surgical procedures. So, you can breathe a little easier knowing these precautions are in place for your loyal companion.
Ah, allergies. For humans, they usually mean sneezing fits and watery eyes. But for Scotties, they manifest as itchiness, especially around the feet, belly, skin folds, and ears. This pesky condition—known as atopy—often becomes noticeable between the ages of one and three and may escalate with age. The symptoms include paw licking, face rubbing, and frequent ear infections. But fret not; there's a doggy antihistamine out there for your pup with various treatment options available.
No one likes to think about it, but cancer is a reality for many older dogs. Scottish Terriers, given their longer life span, are even more susceptible to different types of cancer. Lymphoma is one such cancer that affects white blood cells and is quite treatable with chemotherapy. Another, Mast cell tumors, often show up as skin lumps. These lumps can be tricky because they often look benign but can be quite nasty. Early detection, usually through blood tests or lump checks, is your best line of defense. If you notice anything suspicious, don't hesitate to consult your vet for the next steps is necessary.

If you're dreaming of a house full of puppy paws, there's something crucial you need to know about breeds like the Diehard: they tend to have difficulties during the birthing process due to a large head and small pelvis. Often, a C-section is needed to ensure both mama and pups are safe. So, before you consider playing matchmaker for your Diehard, consult with us. We can help you make an informed decision based on the physical characteristics of both the sire and dam.
Imagine feeling the constant need to pee but being unable to do so. Sounds painful, right? Scottish Terriers are more likely to develop kidney and bladder stones than other breeds. Blood in the urine or straining to urinate is not just a concern—it's a full-blown medical emergency. Luckily, routine urine tests can catch this problem early on, so make sure you keep up with your vet appointments.
If you notice your Scottie running along and suddenly hopping like a bunny, it could be a sign of patellar luxation, a condition where the kneecap slips out of place. Mild cases may only need arthritis medication, but severe ones might require surgery to keep the kneecap in place. Hip dysplasia, another joint issue, is also common in Scottish Terriers and can make getting up from a lying-down position tough for your pup. Early detection via X-rays and weight management can help manage these conditions more effectively.
Is your young Scottie having a tough time eating or showing signs of discomfort when opening their mouth? It could be craniomandibular osteopathy, a peculiar condition where there is a temporary, abnormal overgrowth of bone in the jaw or head. It typically resolves by itself by the time they turn one, but pain medication, a soft diet, and sometimes a feeding tube may be necessary to help your little friend.
If your Scottish Terrier experiences seizures, it's essential to know that there are different types. Some seizures could be due to metabolic issues or toxins (reactive), while others could be due to more serious problems like tumors or strokes (secondary). In cases where no cause can be found, the condition is known as primary or idiopathicepilepsy. Lifelong medication is often required to keep seizures at bay, and it's crucial to keep track of their length and frequency for medical evaluation.

You might find your Scottish Terrier or Cesky Terrier puppy showing an unusual gait or arching of the spine after a good round of play. This condition, known as Scotty Cramp, isn't painful but can be disconcerting to watch. There's no specific cure, but medications can provide some relief. Because this condition is hereditary, it's recommended not to breed affected dogs to prevent passing it on to future generations.
Hyperphosphatemia is a condition where there's an elevated level of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the bloodstream. Interestingly, affected Scotties often show no visible signs of illness. However, liver cell abnormalities might be spotted under microscopic examination. While elevated ALP can be a marker for other, more serious conditions, if those are ruled out, no treatment is usually necessary.
