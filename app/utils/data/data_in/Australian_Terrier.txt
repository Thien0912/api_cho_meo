The Australian Terrier is a dog breed that originated from Tasmania and was bred with various European breeds. It is known as the national breed of Australia and was the first breed to be developed there. Originally, it had different names such as Toy, Blue, and Rough-coated Terrier. The dog was initially exhibited as the ‚Äúbroken-coated terrier of blackish blue sheen‚Äù. It was known for its tan and blue variations, with sandy and red markings being developed later. The Australian Terrier was developed in the 1800s using a combination of Dandie Dinmont, Skye, Scottish, Manchester, and Yorkshire Terriers. Its original purpose was to kill snakes and vermin while also serving as a loyal companion.
The Australian Terrier Club was established in Melbourne in 1887, with The Australian Rough-Coated Terrier Club being the first organization to develop the breed to its standard. The official standard for the breed was established in 1896. The Australian Terrier gained popularity in British households and made its first appearance in the United States in 1925. It was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1960.

‚ö° Fun Fact: Australian Terrier dogs are a social breed. They enjoy being around people or other animals. This breed doesn‚Äôt tolerate being left alone.
They are a social dog by nature, and their interactions with others reflect their feisty attitude and sense of sass. This dog, although they can be obstinate, is known for its wit and love of people. They thrive on their independence. A medium-energy canine needs exercise to stay happy and in good physical and mental balance. The Australian Terrier is known as a vibrant dog and has an attentive demeanor. It could be challenging for this hunter to get along with cats and tiny rodents because they were initially developed to hunt and kill pests. They have, however, been shown to adapt to coexisting with different species given training. Either living with one individual or with family members is an option for them. Although initially wary of strangers, this dog will eventually become friendly.
Australian Terrier dogs thrive when they are the sole pet in a household, as they prefer to have all the attention to themselves. While they are generally friendly towards strangers, they may not be the most outgoing breed. However, Australian Terriers are known to be great with kids, making them a suitable choice for families with children. On the other hand, they do not get along well with cats or other dogs, so they may not be the best fit if you have other pets or if you want to have multiple dogs or participate in dog meetups.

Regular brushing also lessens shedding. Every 6 to 8 weeks, dead hair should be stripped off. It is advised to bathe the dog at least once every four weeks to maintain hygiene. A dull-looking coat will result from over-bathing. To encourage oils for a glossy finish, the undercoat should be carefully brushed. To preserve a stylish appearance, trimming is advised if hair around the eyes and ears becomes too long. The nails should be cut every three to four weeks, like with most dogs, to prevent tears brought on by overgrowth. Weekly ear checks are recommended to avoid ear wax accumulation, which can result in infection. The Australian Terrier is a fairly odor-free dog that sheds very little to no hair.

As pups, Australian Terriers are extremely curious and like to thoroughly explore their surroundings. They learn a great deal during puppyhood, like what‚Äôs acceptable behavior and what isn‚Äôt. Potential puppy owners should know that boundaries will be pushed! These sweet-natured puppies want nothing more than to fit in with their human pack. They don‚Äôt like being isolated from their companions and can develop destructive behaviors if left alone for too long.
These puppies typically love playing with children and learning new skills with a bit of direction. While feisty and playful during the day, an Australian Terrier puppy usually has no problem cuddling up for a nice sleep at night. Puppyhood is the perfect time to start obedience training and to socialize with other people and animals.
It all started for the Australian Terrier when Australians desperately needed help controlling rodent infestations in gold mines, waterfronts, and farms. They decided to develop a small but sturdy breed with a protective coat that could handle the job of keeping rodents at bay. They utilized short-legged dogs with rough coats that were transported to Australia from Britain in the first sailing ships that arrived on the mainland.
These dogs came about in the 1820s and have since become loyal companions that Australians prize. This is the first breed to be recognized in the country, establishing them as a breed that is worth celebrating. It isn‚Äôt clear exactly what breeds were used to create the Australian Terrier, but most agree that the Skye Terrier, Black and Tan Terrier, and even the Yorkshire Terrier were all involved in the process.

The Australian Terrier is a working dog with plenty of energy and loves spending time with human companions. They‚Äôre great rodent hunters, as that is what they were bred for, but that is not the limit to their abilities. These impressive dogs are loyal and protective, so they can be taught to work as watchdogs in their homes. They are not aggressive or dangerous to would-be intruders, but they will cause a ruckus and ensure that anyone who is home knows that something is going on outside the home.
These dogs are friendly and can be quite sociable when exposed to other people and dogs as puppies. They can get boisterous and overexcited when in high-activity spaces, but daily exercise helps keep them in check. This vocal breed likes to howl and bark as a major form of their communication. While they don‚Äôt mind lounging around with their companions, these dogs are far from lazy and won‚Äôt stay sitting for long.
These dogs are great pets for families with children because they are so playful and energetic. The kids can help keep them company throughout the day! They are on the smaller side too, so they should not pose a high threat of accidental injuries to little ones in the household. These loving pups are usually easy to get along with and smart enough to pick up obedience training quickly.
The Australian Terrier can get along with other pets in their household, but they should be socialized as puppies to ensure harmony. They have an instinct to chase small rodents and animals, so they are not a great fit for households that have mice, ferrets, rabbits, or other small critters living in them. Exposure to other dogs outside of the house will help ensure that an Australian Terrier can get along in public settings like dog parks.
However, due to their territorial nature, some Aussie Terriers won‚Äôt get along with other animals at all. Still, the more often they are introduced to dogs in public spaces while still puppies, the less likely they will be to become territorial or aggressive when they‚Äôre out and about.

The Aussie Terrier might not be a large dog, but their highly active nature means they expel plenty of energy, so many owners are surprised at how much (and how fast!) they can eat at mealtime. Still, these dogs shouldn‚Äôt eat more than what is suggested on the package of their food or what is recommended by a veterinarian. Choose food that is formulated for each life phase of your pup‚Äôs life, such as puppy, adult, or senior.
Due to the energetic nature of the Australian Terrier, daily exercise is a necessity to keep them happy and healthy. This breed should go on daily walks of at least 30 minutes in length, along with having plenty of time to run and play. When outside, this breed should always be leashed or detained in a fully fenced yard, or they are likely to sprint off and chase squirrels, cats, and other small animals that are running around outside. These dogs love activities like fetch, hide-and-seek, and swimming.
Introductory obedience training sessions or puppy classes should begin as soon as an Australian Terrier comes home for the first time. This breed gets bored easily, so training sessions should be kept short, sweet, and to the point, and they should happen as often as two or three times a day. These dogs can be a bit stubborn, so consistency is the key to successful training. Treats and praise can go a long way in getting this breed to do the right thing.
This adorable dog breed has a thick double coat that happens to be weatherproof to keep them protected in harsh conditions. It hardly sheds and effectively repels dirt and grime, which makes for easy maintenance. A light weekly brushing should do the trick. Sometimes, the long hairs growing between and around their eyes can become irritating and may need to be trimmed or plucked occasionally. Bathing with dog-safe shampoo should only take place when it seems necessary. The nails can stay naturally trimmed if daily walking on concrete takes place; otherwise, a quick trim with clippers or a grinder can keep nails smooth.
Australian Shepherds are healthy dogs in general, with few susceptibilities to health problems. Quality breeders test their breeding stock to ensure that they don‚Äôt breed puppies that are genetically susceptible to problems like luxating patella. Still, there are certain conditions that this breed could end up with.

The biggest difference between male and female Australian Terriers is their size. Females tend to be lighter and shorter than their male siblings. Also, females that are not spayed tend to be more territorial than males. However, for the most part, there are not any differences between the sexes that would make one a better pet than the other.

Due to being bred for rodent control, Australian Terriers are prey-driven, which means that they can be hard to control when small animals are running around. While they might know to stay near you during a walk and wouldn‚Äôt dare leave your side without a leash when there are no distractions around, chances are that they would bolt if they saw an animal scurrying nearby. Therefore, it‚Äôs important to ensure that any Australian Terrier that is spending time outdoors is always leashed and supervised.
This breed is known for being territorial, which can be a problem if they are not well-socialized at a young age. They may never accept ‚Äústrange‚Äù dogs in their own homes, though, so if they will be living with another dog, the other dog should be introduced to the household before or with them.
The typical Australian Terrier doesn‚Äôt like spending time alone. So, if they are left by themselves all day while everyone is at work or school, they can get lonely and destructive and even develop separation anxiety. It‚Äôs best to make sure someone can come and spend time with them during the day if everyone must be away for whatever reason. Ideally, someone will be home most days to keep their household pup company.

Australian Terriers are proud, outgoing, playful, loyal, and protective little pups that can make great family pets. They are high-energy and don‚Äôt like being by themselves, so caretakers should be prepared to engage in daily exercise activities and ensure that time spent at home alone is kept to a minimum.

Bred to hunt snakes, vermin, and small animals, the Australian terrier is said to have originated in Tasmania in the early 19th century. According to many sources, a dog named rough-coated terrier that was brought to Australia from Great Britain is the ancestor of this lovely breed.
This terrier was cross-bred with several other terrier breeds to achieve the desired traits of a tough, fast, and weatherproof dog. These included the Dandie dinmont terrier, Yorkshire terrier, Skye terrier, Irish terrier, Manchester terrier, and cairn terrier.
The main job of these dogs was to work on farms alongside farmers. They kept the farms clear of rodents and snakes. They also used to tend to the sheep and alert farmers if there were strangers.
This hardy dog was perfect to work in harsh weather. It made a perfect watchdog and companion for European workers settled on the Australian Continent.
The Australian terrier is the first native Australian breed. The breed was first shown in Melbourne, Australia, in 1868. It was initially referred to as the Australian rough-coated terrier. They were officially recognized as the Australian terrier in 1896 when the breed standard was decided.
The Australian terriers were brought to England by servicemen in the early 20th century. It was recognized by England‚Äôs Kennel club in 1933. Soon after, in the mid-1900s, the breed was introduced in America.
The Australian terrier club was formed in 1957. After the efforts of a few breed enthusiasts, the American kennel club recognized the breed in 1960.
The Australian terriers are one of the smallest breeds of the terrier group. They are approximately 11 inches at the shoulder. Their body is longer than it is tall, with short but well-built muscular legs. They have strong shoulders and deep chests.
They have small erect ears with an always alert face-that is a necessary trait of working terriers. They almost always have dark eyes, black noses, and strong muzzles. Aussies also support a ruff around the neck and a top knot of longer hair that add to their intelligent look.
Their tail was originally docked by farmers to protect them from injuries while working in the fields. Now, it is outlawed in many countries, so docked tail terriers are a rare sight.
They are small dogs that are approximately 11 inches tall at the shoulder.
The males weigh between 15-18 pounds, whereas the females are proportionally smaller and range between 14-17 pounds.
The Australian terriers have a medium-length harsh coat. They have a double coat of fur. It is rather short at the muzzle, feet, and lower legs. It is longer at the chest and head. The shaggy coat has a soft undercoat that is about 2 inches in length and soft to the touch.
The Australian terriers typically come in three different coat colors, blue and tan, sandy and red. They can also have other color variations, such as steel blue and tan, dark grey blue, or solid black.
Australian terriers are the most friendly of all terriers. They might be the only terriers with a tendency to please their owners. The somehow obedient nature makes Australian terriers good pets. They also love children, are easy to travel with, and adapt well to new environments.
Australian terriers have keen senses. As they were bred to be hunters, they are always on the go. They may be small, but they are as confident as any large dog breed.
They do great as watchdogs. They will bark to alert their owners of any unusual or suspicious activity. They fight bravely and never back down from an attack if a situation arises.
The Aussie is fearless and has a strong instinct for chasing and killing small animals like rabbits, squirrels, mice, and even cats. They dominate other dogs and small children. If you have more than one dog in the house, lots of socialization will be needed.
They are not suggested for novice owners unless they are ready to take up the challenge of training the terrier and keeping up with all its requirements.
The Australian terrier loves to dig. You can‚Äôt have both a fancy garden and a terrier in the house. They will dig up any open space they find. A securely fenced yard is necessary to make sure they don‚Äôt escape. They need a much higher fence compared to their small size.
The Australian terrier is generally a sturdy and healthy breed, but there are a few inheritable diseases that you should watch out for. Breeders should be careful to test their breeding stock for diseases such as patellar luxation and Legg-calve-perthes disease.
The national breed club recommends health tests for patella evaluation, thyroid evaluation, and ophthalmologist evaluation.
If you own an Australian terrier or you are looking for one, here are a few health conditions you must be aware of.
This disease is related to the abnormal deformity of the hip joint. There is reduced blood supply to the femur bone, and the femoral head starts deforming. It results in arthritis of the hip joint.
The cause of this disease is unknown, it can be hereditary or due to a direct injury to the bone. Treatment includes physical therapy and rest. Surgery can treat the condition permanently with just a little lameness in cold seasons.
In this condition, the patella or knee joint dislocates. The kneecap slides in and out of place, causing extreme pain for the pooch. It can be corrected with surgery.
Like other dogs, especially terriers, the Australian terrier is also prone to allergies. The symptoms include itching or bald spots. They can be due to something in the food, which is corrected by an elimination diet. Environmental and contact allergies are also common.
Diabetes is common in an Australian terrier and occurs when the body has trouble regulating the sugar levels in the blood. The dog may feel super thirsty or hungry. There will be frequent urination, and lethargy is also common.
Due to poor absorption of food, there may be weight loss. Treatment is possible and effective with early diagnosis.
The Aussies have a thick double coat of fur. It is harsh, weatherproof, and repels dirt very well. The coat needs thorough brushing once a week. Brushing will help in natural oil secretion that will keep the hair shiny.
Aussies don‚Äôt need a regular bath. They should be bathed only when extremely necessary. The soap and water will strip the hair of natural oils and make it softer than it usually is-reducing its self-cleaning properties. Shampoo can also make the skin dry and flaky.
Check the coat for ticks and mites, especially after walks. Remove if you find any. Take them to the veterinarian if the problem prolongs.
Hair clipping is not recommended for the Australian terrier. It can change the texture of hair and make it smoother than it needs to be. Hand stripping should be done every few weeks. It is a method to pluck out dead hair with hands so that new hair can grow in its place.
This sort of grooming is done better by a professional. It is recommended that you visit your pet salon every couple of months.
The Australian terrier has hair growth between and on top of the eyes. If left unchecked, it can irritate the eyes. Make sure you pluck them or strip them with your hands to avoid discomfort.
Like all other dogs, regular trimming of nails is necessary. Brush the teeth to remove tartar buildup. Lastly, check the ears for any sort of odd smell. Gently clean with a damp cotton ball to remove dirt and avoid infection.
Like other small breeds, the Australian terrier also has moderate food requirements. Their appetite is better than other terriers, and they are not very choosy. Provide one cup of high-quality dog food every day divided into two or three meals.
Also, keep your dog well-hydrated. Make sure you do not overfeed, as excessive weight gain is detrimental to their joint health.
Always consult with a veterinarian to get a well-tailored diet plan for your dog.
These are high-energy dogs that need regular exercise and mental stimulation. Although they would be great in houses with open yards, they do equally well in apartments. Make sure you provide enough exercise and playtime in the park to keep them happy.
On average, they need 90 minutes of daily play sessions or exercise. Take them along on long walks, hiking, or to a local park. Just make sure they are always leashed. If your dog pulls, try using the no-pull dog harness.
Once you bring the Australian terrier home, you need to set the leadership roles right away. They tend to be very independent and try to take the role of a boss. If you don‚Äôt stand your ground and tell them early on about your place, they will surely try to be your leader too.
These spunky pooches also tend to be dominant among other dogs. They don‚Äôt like to share their space and may get aggressive. Lots of training and early socialization will help them get along.
They are highly intelligent and learn quickly. They get bored easily if the instructions are repetitive and long. Keep training sessions short and interesting with lots of treats and positive reinforcement, a good incentive always pays back.
Progressively challenging levels of obedience classes and agility training work wonders for the Aussie as they keep him entertained.
If they do not receive enough mental stimulation, they will indulge in negative behaviors. They typically bark a lot and chew on anything they can find if bored.
The Australian terrier is a small dog with a lot of confidence. It is energetic, self-assured, smart, and spirited. There is a lot more to this dog than it appears.
These tiny boss dogs were bred in Australia to help farmers in keeping the properties clear of snakes and rodents and for herding the sheep. They soon became companions for servicemen and made their way around the world.
As hunting dogs, their instincts to chase are very strong. They can be expected to sniff on walks and look for cats and mice to hunt. Their alert nature makes them great watchdogs.
You have nothing to worry about with an Australian terrier on guard.
They need lots of socialization and puppy training classes to behave well among strangers and other dogs. They don‚Äôt do well in a multi-dog or multi-pet household as they want to dominate and keep the house all for themselves.
They are sturdy dogs with a long life span. If given proper living conditions, they lead a happy and healthy life.
If you are looking forward to buying purebred dogs, try searching the shelters first. Always buy from a well-reputed breeder who can present all screening tests for the breed.

Many people fall in love with the Australian Terrier at first sight because of their cuteness, but what owner‚Äôs don‚Äôt realize is just how clever and active they truly are. For those who come to know and love this breed, their ‚Äúdown under‚Äù attitude only becomes more appealing over time. If you live with an Australian Terrier, be prepared for a lot of laughter since they find typical terrier hobbies ‚Äî digging, barking, and chasing the family cat‚Äî extremely amusing.
The Australian Terrier is a versatile breed that can adapt to many types of living situations, from city apartments to rural farmhouses. As with all terriers, it‚Äôs important to start training early so that their natural energy and curiosity are channeled into constructive activities. Otherwise, a bored Australian Terrier will likely become destructive by digging holes or jumping fences.
Apartment or condo living is the Australian Terrier‚Äôs perfect habitat, however only if you can train him to control his barking, or be there yourself to keep it at a minimum. These small dogs are excellent watchdogs; though your neighbors might describe them as ‚Äònuisance barkers‚Äô.
Confident and independent, Australian Terriers are natural born leaders‚Äìbut that might not be a good thing if you have other pets. Because they like to assert their dominance, Ausies don‚Äôt generally get along with either cats or other dogs‚Äìespecially if both are male. And since marking their territory is also part of asserting their alpha status, belly bands to block the pee from hitting your furniture may become a common sight in your home.
Although show dogs get more delicate grooming, pet Australian Terriers have easy-to-care-for coats that come in several colors. Just give them an occassional bath and comb or brush their fur once a week to reduce shedding. They‚Äôre not meant to live outside, so keep them indoors as part of your family.
