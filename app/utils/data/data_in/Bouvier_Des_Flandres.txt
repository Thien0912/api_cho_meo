Imagine you are a young calf roaming the countryside of Belgium, wandering a bit too far off the path. You begin to worry because you do not recognize your surroundings, and the rest of the herd is nowhere to be seen.

Just because these dogs are hard-working does not mean they don't enjoy some downtime. When the des Flandres dogs finish working the land, you will find that they make affectionate and fantastic companions for any human.

The following piece will continue to highlight the many unique characteristics of the Bouvier des Flandres, their history, how to best care for this breed, and whether a Bouvier des Flandres is the right dog for you.


One of the most iconic physical characteristics of the Bouvier des Flandres is its rugged, thick double coat. This double coat offers a great deal of warmth and is water-resistant without being too bulky. Overall, their coat is very curly.
Underneath its shaggy exterior, the build of the Bouvier des Flandres is compact yet powerful.,¬† This breed is known for its agility in herding, and its stern, steady presence on the field. Des Flandres are sure of themselves and can sometimes come across as somewhat strong-headed. But they can also have a sweet and affectionate side too.

Bouvier des Flandres are bold as far as attitude goes. Despite their short height, they continuously demonstrate their physical dominance with their broad chest, long legs, and muscular exterior.

Some standout facial features of the des Flandres breed include floppy ears, broad muzzles, and bushy hair covering their eyes. With a life span of 10-15 years, des Flandres dogs will promise many wonderful memories for years to come.

Bouvier des Flandres dogs are relatively short. Male des Flandres can range from 24.5 to 27.5 inches in height, and female des Flandres reach 23.5 to 26.5 inches.

The weight of a Bouvier des Flandres typically lands somewhere between 70 to 110 pounds, making these dogs a sturdy and robust breed.


Falling under the herding breed category, Bouvier des Flandres dogs are unrelentingly fearless, tactical, and persistent. They are hard-working when it comes to farm work and are always seeking new challenges to complete.

This impatience is the breed‚Äôs downfall, as it tends to lead to boredom. Destruction can follow as a result of this boredom, and then you may end up with a shepherd-sized mess on your hands! But this personality trait demonstrates how adamant the des Flandres are about learning new things and keeping busy.

Aside from their workaholic personality, des Flandres are quite friendly and affectionate. After a rough day out in the fields, a des Flandres dog loves to kick back and relax with its owner until the sun comes up and it's time for work again.



Since the Bouvier des Flandres is a working breed, they require a decent amount of daily exercise. We recommend providing your Flandres with 60-90 minutes of intense activity every day. Running, sports, or herding are fantastic ways to keep this canine happy and healthy!

Bouvier des Flandres dogs love being outside and working in the fields with cattle and other animals. Not only do they adore fieldwork, but they also make a great companion to someone who enjoys hiking, jogging, or other outdoor activities. If you're a fan of staying active, a Bouvier des Flandres is more than willing to go along for the ride and try to keep up with you.

Because of their high energy level, des Flandres need access to an environment where they can run and play, perhaps with other dogs or children. So, an apartment building may not be the ideal living situation for this breed. A house with a big yard or access to a large area of land should suffice for a des Flandres.

As mentioned, des Flandres are incredibly active and enjoy learning new things. Des Flandres can be a rewarding dog breed to train because they constantly seek opportunities to learn new tasks and different activities to participate in.

Bouvier des Flandres are always eager to please their owners, so they are fantastic breeds for competitions.

However, des Flandres are only as responsive to training as their owner is stern and confident in teaching them.

Des Flandres constantly seek new ways to stay engaged. They excel in physical activities but can grow bored when they are not stimulated, resulting in destructive behavior. So, it is crucial to keep des Flandres dogs busy by providing new challenges and learning opportunities through physical movement.


Bouvier des Flandres is translated from French as "Cow Herder of Flanders." The breed originated from Flanders in Belgium, hence the name. Belgium was once home to several "Bouvier" breeds, but the Bouvier des Flandres is the last one standing in any significant number.

The Bouvier des Flandres breed originated as a working dog, herding cattle on farms in Belgium and Northern France. But the des Flandres breed was incredibly versatile and could perform many other jobs as well.¬† Their ability to serve as watchdogs, guardians, and cart-pullers made this breed desirable to many people.

This Bouvier breed became very popular at the beginning of the 20th century on farms all across Flanders because of their work ethic. But, many des Flandres dogs were lost or killed during the battles of World War I.

People admired the des Flandres breed during this time because they served as medical dogs and messengers during the war. If it were not for the Belgium army protecting them, the Bouvier des Flandres breed would not be around today.

In 1929, the American Kennel Club recognized the Bouvier des Flandres breed and imported many dogs to the United States. Years later, in 1969, the American Bouvier des Flandres Club was formed. This organization still operates today, providing owners with educational resources on proper care for their des Flandres friend.

As with any pet, it is essential to understand the potential health issues that may arise. This prepares you to handle them appropriately. Although some of the following health problems can also be found in other canine breeds, these are the most common ones among Bouvier des Flandres dogs.

Although dental disease is common among most dog breeds (affecting about 80% of dogs), the Bouvier des Flandres is especially prone to dental trouble. These issues begin when tartar builds up on the teeth, resulting in infections that can damage the liver, kidneys, and heart. The best way to prevent dental disease is by cleaning your dog's teeth regularly and checking for tartar build-up.


Obesity is a significant problem among Bouvier des Flandres dogs. Excessive weight can lead to joint problems, digestive disorders, and heart disease. To prevent these issues, maintain a healthy diet and exercise your dog often. This can significantly lower their chance of becoming obese.

Bouvier des Flandres are famous for having digestive issues like bloat. Bloat occurs more in deep-chested dogs, though its exact cause is unknown. This condition causes the stomach to twist upon itself, preventing gas from escaping. If left untreated, bloat can be fatal! Besides bloat, des Flandres are also prone to general digestive issues like diarrhea or vomiting.¬† Maintaining a balanced diet while avoiding excess dog treats and table food is the number one solution to stomach issues.

Laryngeal Paralysis is a disease that paralyzes the vocal cords, blocking the airway and making it difficult to breathe. Although this is prevalent in older des Flandres dogs,¬† symptoms may occur in a dog of any age when exercising or walking around in hot weather. While you can treat mild cases with medication and care at home, more severe cases may need emergency surgery.




As we said before, Bouvier des Flandres are very active dogs that need plenty of exercise and space to roam free. Des Flandres is a wonderful breed for hiking, jogging, playing fetch, and any other activities that take place outside.
It‚Äôs essential to keep a Bouvier des Flandres mentally healthy by always teaching them new skills and tricks. If these dogs find themselves getting even the slightest bit bored, you may find a mess around the house.

Besides keeping a des Flandres physically and mentally content, there are several other aspects to caring for your curly-haired friends, such as diet and grooming.

With any dog breed, a nutritious diet is necessary to maintain a long and healthy life. Specifically for a Bouvier des Flanders dog, they respond best to a diet of high-quality dog food.

From the young age of a puppy to the older stages of life, a des Flandres responds best to the highest quality of food available. Their chow can be either commercially manufactured or home-prepared, as long as they munch natural and nutritious ingredients.

Compared to other breeds, the des Flandres requires a diet with low protein. The reasoning for cutting back on protein is that des Flandres are prone to obesity, which can lead to other serious problems such as joint pain and heart disease.

To avoid these problems, follow a strict diet and hide the treats when you need to! Although giving your dog treats can be great for training, limiting their treat intake will help stabilize your dog's weight.

Similarly, withholding table food away from your dog is favorable for keeping them slim and healthy. No matter how cute they look when they beg, don't give in!

Des Flandres breeds have thick (and sometimes knotted) coats that require plenty of attention and patience to maintain. Their double coats are dense yet soft and water-resistant. This double coat is perfect for inclement weather when out on the farmlands and can protect the dog from other uncertain conditions.

Bouvier des Flandres coat color ranges from fawn to black, and sometimes can be a salt and peppered colored coat.

Because of its rugged texture, it is necessary to brush your dog's coat at least once a week. Brushing your dog's coat will ensure softer and slicker fur. Regular brushing also helps prevent tangles and mats from forming. Either a slicker brush or a large comb will suffice for a des Flandres breed.

You may notice that a Bouvier des Flandres coat can grow rather quickly, especially around the face. Trimming the facial features, such as the mustache and shaggy hair over the eyes, should also be done as needed. Otherwise, your dog may have a bit of trouble seeing! You can always have a professional groomer assist you if your Flandres doesn't let you do this at home.

Bouvier des Flandres have fast-growing nails, so be sure to trim them every two weeks at a minimum. If you don‚Äôt trim their nails, you may get scratched up the next time you go in for a hug with your fluffy friend.


Des Flandres make great family pets because of their loyalty and charm. But, because of their innate herding background, it is best to supervise young children in the presence of a Bouvier des Flandres. It is possible that a des Flandres dog could mistake a small child for a young cattle and start herding the child all around the house. Yes, this is funny to imagine, but it could also be traumatizing for the child.

The des Flandres‚Äô herding instincts can also sometimes make them territorial and over-protective. To discourage these traits, start socializing your dog at a young age. Socialization can help prevent any issues related to possession and guarding. You can do this by taking them to the dog park or allowing them to meet strangers when out for walks.

Naturally, des Flandres are meant to herd other animals. So, they may attempt to assert their dominance among other pets. But with proper training and socialization, a des Flandres can learn to be friendly with other dogs.

Finding time to schedule playdates with other dogs or take them to a dog park can be very beneficial for a des Flandres. This exposure helps them learn how they should interact with other dogs.

As far as their relationship with children, des Flandres are typically well-behaved and have no serious problems being the family pet. However, because of their background in herding, we recommend keeping an eye on your younger children while they play with the family dog. Again, you do not want to catch your Bouvier herding your child all around the house like a baby cow.
