The magazine for animal lovers
The Malinois breed originally comes from Belgium, to be more precise from the Noord-Brabant region. The name is based on the city of Mechelen (or Malines in French).
As early as the 18th century, this dog breed was used as a guard dog and also as a herding dog. But the sporty dogs were also used as pulling dogs. This is a short-haired type of Belgian Shepherd Dog. At the FCI, the Mali is classified in Group 1 herding dogs and cattle dogs and belongs to Section 1 of sheepdogs. The breed was officially recognized around 1900.
The Malinois is now one of the most popular protection dogs and is also often used in the police service in a wide variety of tasks. But this sporty breed also shows what they are made of in sport.
There are different varieties of the Belgian Shepherd Dog. The Mali only differs from the others in its coat color and texture. All other external features are the same. The coat of this breed is short and close-fitting.
The Mali's fur is usually fawn colored. However, this varies from light tones to sandy, reddish brown and dark brown colors. He wears a black mask and a black cloud.
The Mali is not a tiny man. Males have a height of 60-66 cm at the withers and females 56-62 centimeters. The weight ranges between 22-40 kilograms. From this you can see that a Malinois is usually very well trained and muscular and only carries the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù weight.
Life expectancy is 12-14 years with healthy breeding and husbandry.
Make sure your Mali gets enough rest. This breed goes crazy quickly and no one wants to have a Mali as a hyperactive bundle of nerves at home. Of course you can do that here Ceiling training insert it and also connect it to one Dog Crate get used to. A hyperactive Malinois is a powder keg, which can quickly become dangerous. You also want to have some peace and quiet in the house, right?
When buying a Malinois, you should be aware from the start that you are bringing a sporty dog ‚Äã‚Äãinto your home. These dogs love working with you. They want to be supported and challenged.
Basically, the Mali enjoys all sports and activities in which he can show his intelligence and temperament. This is one of the reasons why he is often used in public service by the police, customs and generally in the security service.
In addition to the security service, the Mali likes to use his nose just as much and can therefore help Mantrailing, can be used as a tracking and scoping dog or at the ZOS.
By the way, he is also often used as a search dog for various substances such as drugs, explosives, the smell of corpses, etc. or as an avalanche search dog or for collapsed houses and ruins.
Your Mali is having fun too THS, intelligence toys or  Obedience.
Be careful with things that are addictive: Malians become ball junkies very quickly!
As you can see, the employment opportunities are diverse. Not keeping a dog like that busy would be a big mistake. However, you should also remember that Your Mali should learn to rest and doesn't get constant refueling.
Overall, you don't have to worry about your Mali's diet. Of course, it is important that you make sure that this athlete does not become overweight.
We'll come back to typical diseases in Malinois below, but at this point we'd like to point out that a healthy diet makes defecation easier for dogs with spondylosis or dysplasia.
Of course, you should generally pay attention to the health of your Malinois. This is how dental care belongs with one Toothbrush as well as regular claw cutting and the Grooming. But there are also some typical illnesses for this breed that we would like to inform you about.

For years I have been concerned with the species-appropriate and healthy keeping of animals. In addition to animal protection, species protection is also important to me.
Through my dog ‚Äã‚ÄãMira, I experience every day how social and empathetic animals are. That's why it's important to me to educate people and make the world a little better for animals.

A puppy is moving in and an exciting time is beginning. Of course you want to give your four-legged friend the best start in life and so you may be racking your brains over the topic of dog food? In this article we will introduce you to ANIfit Junior puppy food. This wet food is new on the market and we have already been able to test it. As always, you can read about our experiences in this article.

Great text! We'll soon be getting a 1 year old Mali Herder mix and what you read in forums about how people are made afraid of the breed is no longer nice. Thank you for this factual and realistic text üôÇ
Hello Maria, I can understand that there is ‚Äúfear‚Äù about the breed because it is one of the most demanding breeds that I know. When a dog like that lashes out, things get really difficult. But that doesn't automatically mean it's a beast. Before you buy, you just have to be aware that it is a breed of dog that places high demands on the owner and does not always go along with everything. I know some Malis who are just great. And I know some who aren't because of their history. But it's not really any different with an Australian Shepherd, for example. In any case, I wish you a lot of joy and would be happy if you would tell us here how life together is going for you.
Best regards,
wiebke
In my life I have had several dogs that were used for sport and/or work purposes. Now, as a fit pensioner, I got what is probably my last dog, a Mali male who is nine months old and has previously lived in a kennel. I knew about the possible problems...
I can agree with the assessment in the above text on almost all points...but it's usually even worse. üòâ But ‚Äì my little Mali is the best dog I've ever had. Not willing to work but a workaholic, with inexhaustible energy and, after installing the off switch, with an extremely pleasant nature and the best manners. Peaceful towards people, other dogs and even cats and, if necessary, to 120% within a tenth of a second - I love dogs like that. They work until the handler is exhausted‚Ä¶.
A special feature of the Malinois is the off switch mentioned above - it is naturally present but not activated. Perhaps the most important task with a young Mali is to teach him that there are times of rest and times of action. In the meantime, even after ten minutes of extensive romping, all that is required is a quiet ‚ÄúStop‚Äù to really suddenly switch to quiet. Did I mention that I love dogs like this? üôÇ
Now I hope that the rescue dog training that has begun will make the desired progress in the next few months. The dog has the ability to do this and I hope to be able to do my part.
In short: Don't let yourself be scared. The Malinois (at least mine) is really a great dog - but certainly only recommended for beginners in exceptional cases. Somewhere on the internet I read: (essentially) ‚ÄúThe Malinois fluctuates between the endless love for his handler and the attempt to own one and then immediately take over the world.‚Äù Note: There could be something in that‚Ä¶ üòâ
If you choose a Malinois, you also decide to give a piece of your soul to him. If it's the right piece, you'll get 100% of his soul and, on top of that, an intelligent, reliable and absolutely loyal companion, every single day - and you'll never regret it.
Thank you for the detailed and great comment. We are sure that this will also help other readers make their decision.
Kind regards from the pfoten.net team

Crazy great description 100%!
Thank you
I have a Mali mix who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Has anything like this ever been reported on the terrace? What can be done to alleviate it? There is probably no cure. What can be done? Are there any medications for it?

Learn more about this strong, intelligent yet controversial dog and whether the Belgian Malinois would be well suited to your home

Life expectancy: 10 to 14 years
Size: 25-inches, average (male); 23 inches, average (female)
Coat: Short, dense, double coat
Temperament: Protective, active, hard-working, active, alert, confident and stubborn
Exercise needs: Minimum of two hours daily
Origin/native country: Belgium
Belgian Malinois are large, strong dogs originally bred for herding. Given their loyalty, athleticism, strength and stamina, they have become a favorite breed within the military and police, and they‚Äôre exclusively used by the US Secret Service and the Navy Seals.
Similar to German Shepherds to some extent, they can, however, be controversial primarily because they need to be handled carefully. Some experts have even called for them to be banned as pets because too few people are able to deal with their high energy and intelligence. And yet they remain one of the most popular dog breeds. Should you get one? Let‚Äôs find out.
There is a very short answer to this one: Belgian Malinois need lots of exercise ‚Äì perhaps more than many potential owners would expect. As high energy dogs, you need to stimulate them both physically and mentally and that means ensuring they get around two hours of hard activity each day. A walk around the block will not suffice.
You don‚Äôt have to devote two hours in one chunk, though. It‚Äôs best to split the exercises across three sessions while making each minute count. Ideally, you‚Äôd have a Belgian Malinois accompany you on a hike or jog or, even better, when you‚Äôre riding that bit faster on a bicycle. If you have a large yard in which they can run, that would help too. In between times, make sure they have plenty of the best dog puzzle toys to help keep them occupied.
In the same way you need to put effort into ensuring Belgian Malinois get a lot of exercise, you need to set aside many hours for training.
‚ÄúBelgian Malinois require an experienced owner who has plenty of time for training,‚Äù says vet Dr Rebecca MacMillan, but it‚Äôs not actually because they‚Äôre slow to learn.
In fact, Belgian Malinois are one of the smartest dog breeds as determined by a study at the University of Helsinki. Researchers found that they were fastest at spatial problem-solving when compared to 12 other breeds and that they were the most successful at understanding human gestures. Belgian Malinois came top over all, with 35 points out of 39.

The main issue is that Belgian Malinois perform poorly in inhibitory control tests which the researchers said meant the breed had a high motivation for rewards, was easily aroused in training and reacted quickly. It‚Äôs great if the dog is being trained for sports and working roles but less so for day-to-day living.
‚ÄúThese dogs are smart, but they have a strong prey drive and chasing instinct because they were originally bred to herd livestock,‚Äù Dr MacMillan affirms. ‚ÄúThis means they can get distracted and chase any moving object such as children, vehicles, and animals. Early socialisation and plenty of reward-based training are very important for these dogs.‚Äù
Given their strong prey drive, it‚Äôs natural to ask if Belgian Malinois are aggressive and the answer is dependent on how well trained and exercised they are.
‚ÄúIn my experience, Belgian Malinois can be a bit stand-offish and are not known for being overly affectionate,‚Äù says Dr MacMillan. ‚ÄúThey are not inherently aggressive but, as with all dogs, the right socialization and training is key to this.‚Äù
One of the problems is that Belgian Malinois are bred to bite and they can cause serious injury if they do. As well as having a bite strength of 195 PSI, they tend not to let go easily. That‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre a cop apprehending a suspect, but considerably less so if you‚Äôre an ordinary dog owner walking around a park with innocent people around. Again, training and exercise is important!

By extension, we come to the issue of whether even a well-trained and exercised Belgian Malinois is a good fit for a family. And it depends, again on exercise, mental stimulation and how active a household is.
‚ÄúThey would be best suited to an active household that can meet these needs,‚Äù Dr MacMillan says. ‚ÄúBehavioral issues are more likely in a dog that is under-exercised and bored. While there are always exceptions, busy young families may not be able to give the Belgian Malinois the right amount of time and attention. In my opinion, this dog would be better suited to a family with older children or adults.‚Äù
At the very least, consider this breed is large and strong ‚Äì more than capable of accidentally knocking over children and babies, potentially causing injuries.
Belgian Malinois are relatively low maintenance dogs in terms of grooming.
‚ÄúThey lose hair moderately most of the time, with two heavy sheds twice a year,‚Äù says Dr MacMillan. ‚ÄúTheir short coat requires little maintenance, with brushing once a week fine being for most of these dogs.‚Äù
In that sense, just brush weekly with a long-pin slicker and comb and keep this breed‚Äôs nails in trim. Bath a Belgian Malinois every couple of months but bear in mind, they are big dogs. You may want to enlist the services of a professional groomer.
As with most pedigree breeds, Belgian Malinois are more likely to develop certain health conditions.
‚ÄúThey are prone to hip and elbow dysplasia,‚Äù says Dr MacMillan. ‚ÄúThey can also suffer from certain eye complaints, such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts. These are hereditary conditions, so it is important to purchase your puppy from a reputable breeder who has health-screened their dogs prior to mating. However, Belgian Malinois are generally a healthy dog breed with the right care and nutrition.‚Äù
As Dr MacMillan says, ‚ÄúBelgian Malinois are not beginners‚Äô dogs.‚Äù
There is no getting round the fact that you need to put a lot of time and effort in training, exercising, stimulating and caring for this breed ‚Äì more so given they form strong, protective bonds with their owners and can, as a consequence, suffer from separation anxiety. Steer clear if you have a young family and think twice if you lead a busy or relatively sedentary lifestyle. It cannot be overstated that you need to be confident you‚Äôre capable of handling a dog such as this.

The Belgian Malinois is a stunning purebred dog that was raised to herd animals. These dogs are incredibly loyal to their masters and work hard to keep their bond with family members strong and intact. Versatile by nature, Belgian Malinois are popular working dogs throughout the military and police communities.
Proud and staunch in stature, the Belgian Malinois are alert dogs that stand as tall as 26 inches in height, which makes them highly effective protection and guard dogs at home if they are trained properly. That said, these dogs are affectionate and patient with family members. So, even households with kids can enjoy the company of a well-trained Belgian Malinois that is well-exercised and consistently interacted with.
However, every member of the family would need to train and lead the dog for success within a household. Belgian Malinois have sturdy builds with muscular physiques that can be intimidating at first, but these dogs aren‚Äôt aggressive by any means. They are curious and engaging, so people spending time with them should be prepared for an active experience.
These dogs are used to working for their room and board, so they aren‚Äôt happy sitting around while waiting for their owners to get home from work every day. The Belgian Malinois needs an owner who‚Äôs an avid hunter, camper, farmer, explorer, or adventurer in general. Are you curious about becoming the proud owner of a Belgian Malinois? There‚Äôs much to learn about these magnificent dogs! Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

The Belgian Malinois is an adorable puppy, but this breed grows into an adult dog that isn‚Äôt quite lap-friendly, though these dogs will happily nap on a dog bed while you watch a movie if they‚Äôve had a long walk or adventure beforehand. Weighing in at up to 65 pounds, this breed isn‚Äôt a pet or working dog for the faint at heart. Here are a few more things you need to know about this fine purebred dog breed.
The Belgian Malinois is highly energetic because they‚Äôre a working dog that expects to have something to do throughout the day. But they are also easily trainable in a variety of ways, including obedience, agility, guarding, herding, sniffing, and protection.

Belgian Malinois are friendly, but they are also attentive and always looking for breaches of trust. They‚Äôll happily hang out in the house for the morning while you read your newspaper, but they will demand a nice long walk later. These strong-willed dogs can be extremely destructive when their needs aren‚Äôt met.
Without plenty of exercise and attention during the day, your Malinois can destruct your furniture, clothing, and other important items while you‚Äôre away from home. Keeping these dogs outside may deter them from ruining stuff indoors, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôll be happy and feel fulfilled. Every Belgian Malinois expects daily interactions with their owners. If they have it their way, they‚Äôll spend every waking (and even sleeping!) second with their first-in-command.
The Belgian Malinois is confident, aware, and perfectly capable of defending their property and family members, whether at home or while out and about. Strangers should always allow this dog to smell and get to know them before engaging in a communicative relationship with such a breed.
Both training and socialization are crucial for this working dog. Without one or the other or both, this breed may become unruly and tough to manage, whether alone with them or while spending time with other people and animals. While these dogs are loving and caring when well taken care of, they can become angry and mischievous when ignored.
This is a strong dog that can‚Äôt always be managed well by young children. They tend to get carried away when playing too, which makes them a physical danger to young kids even though they don‚Äôt typically show aggression to people of any age. Any prospective owner should be aware of this breed‚Äôs power, independence, and training capabilities before considering whether to adopt a dog such as this breed.
The Belgian Malinois wasn‚Äôt bred to become part of a family dynamic. But they were bred to be loyal to their owners and to protect those that they know are important. So, with proper training and daily commitment, these dogs can be happy in an active family‚Äôs life. But for the most part, these dogs are the happiest working with police officers, military personnel, hunters, farmers, and even those who are protection and guarding enthusiasts.
Unless you‚Äôre an experienced dog owner who has a deep understanding of herding breeds, this may not be the right dog breed for your family to adopt. If you like to get outdoors, you know a great deal about dogs, and you‚Äôre looking for a daily adventure companion, the Belgian Malinois just might be the right option for your lifestyle.
When the Belgian Malinois is well-socialized and trained, this dog has no problem getting along with other dogs. Due to their herding nature, they may have a hard time refraining from chasing cats and other animals that they consider to be prey. If an owner expects their Belgian Malinois to get along with their cat, they must introduce the two animals to one another while the puppy is still small and harmless. With practice and exposure, the dog should become accustomed to spending time with the cat regularly.

There is still much to know before deciding whether to adopt one of these dogs. What should you feed them? How much should you exercise them? What kind of grooming do they require? Keep reading to learn the answers to these questions and more.
Like all dog breeds in today‚Äôs world, the Belgian Malinois should do well eating commercial dog food of high quality that is high in protein and free of artificial colorings and flavors. Puppies should eat a portion of food designed specifically for large-breed puppies and then transition to adult food at about 12 months of age.
You can prepare homemade dog food yourself, but it is important to consult with a veterinarian to be sure that you include all the proper nutrients for your Belgian Malinois‚Äô needs. Treats can be used for bonding and training purposes, but overuse could lead to obesity and health problems. Consider using healthy human foods as treats and snacks to manage your dog‚Äôs weight and training temperament.
As a herding dog, the Belgian Malinois needs a great deal of vigorous exercise daily. Taking a long walk, spending time in the yard while practicing training maneuvers, and participating in agility training classes are all things that a Belgian Malinois is sure to enjoy. Activities such as camping and hunting also provide this dog with much-needed exercise that will keep them engaged and satisfied as time goes on.
The Belgian Malinois love playing fetch and chasing games with other dogs, so taking them to a dog park after extensive socialization will give them an outlet to be free and do the things that dogs love to do. Without proper exercise, this breed can become destructive and make living at home for owners stressful. These dogs should never be left alone at home without vigorous play and activity beforehand.
It is essential to train a Belgian Malinois as soon as possible after adopting one to ensure that their hunting, herding, and working instincts are managed properly as they grow bigger. Obedience training is the first type of training to tackle. Learning to sit, stay, and come on command is crucial for the Belgian Malinois so they know what is expected of them. These dogs thrive in an orderly environment, and it is likely that without obedience training, no social experience will be orderly.
In addition to obedience training, Belgian Malinois do well with agility training. These dogs are fast, determined, and focused, making them champions on the agility field. Whether for sport or fun, joining an agility club in your area will allow your Belgian Malinois to socialize, exercise, and stimulate their natural working instincts.
If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable guard dog that will keep your home and property safe when you aren‚Äôt home, the Belgian Malinois is an awesome option to consider. They take well to protection and guard training and aren‚Äôt naturally aggressive, so they rarely become a danger to family members, friends, or even strangers. Protection and guard training should always be done with a professional present to ensure that the right tactics and responses are being utilized.
While the Belgian Malinois has a short coat of fur, they do shed regularly throughout the year. When it starts getting hot outside, most owners notice heavier shedding. Therefore, your pooch will have to be brushed a few times a week to keep their coat shiny and your home free of loose fur.
These dogs are built to work and play outside, so their coats do a good job of repelling water and dirt ‚Äî bathing shouldn‚Äôt be necessary. Because Belgian Malinois are so active, their nails tend to stay naturally trimmed. But their active lifestyle can create ear problems due to dirt buildup, so it is important to gently clean their ears out once a week or so.
Dental hygiene is also important, especially if your Belgian Malinois will participate in guard and protection training, as they‚Äôll be using their teeth and jaws frequently. Brushing your dog‚Äôs teeth or giving them a dental treat a couple of times a week should ensure optimal dental health as time goes on.
The Belgian Malinois is typically extremely healthy, but there are a few minor issues that owners should know about.
Both male and female Belgian Malinois are strong, independent, and loyal. Males tend to mark their territory, even inside, if they haven‚Äôt been neutered. Some owners find that their female dogs are more independent than their males. However, many owners find that both females and males are both as loyal and family-friendly as the other. Like any living being, all Belgian Malinois have their own unique personalities and quirks, and you can‚Äôt predict how they‚Äôll act as they age based solely on their sex.
Belgian Malinois is one of only four types of shepherds in Belgian and France that are registered as Chien De Berger Belge dogs. These different types of shepherds are thought to be originally bred from the same lineage. Every Chien De Berger Belge is bred to herd animals and works hard all day long.
The Belgian Malinois has a close connection to the lineage of the Belgian Sheepdog and the Belgian Tervuren. These are well-known dogs around the world that are revered for their excellent temperament and work ethic.
These dogs are revered worldwide as hard-working dogs, but they have a loving and snuggly side that only owners have the pleasure of experiencing. At home, they‚Äôll snuggle up on the couch or their bed while you lounge around. But when it is time to go outdoors, they become alert and active when it comes to protecting you.

The Belgian Malinois is a strong, reliable working dog that loves an active lifestyle and a job to do. This isn‚Äôt just any house pet. In fact, Belgian Malinois need outdoor time and adventure every day to lead a healthy and happy life. Without training and active outlets, these dogs can become destructive and even dangerous.
These dogs would do well in farm settings and with highly active owners. Outdoor adventures every weekend, several hiking treks a week, and hours of agility or protection training should be priorities for owners of this magnificent purebred dog. Owners should also be prepared to give their dog a job to do daily, whether it is guarding, hauling logs, or providing therapy to patients at the local hospital.

The Belgian Malinois is a highly intelligent, diligent, and loyal breed. Ideally, this dog is suited to working lifestyles, such as farm work, police work, and even the special forces.¬† That is exactly why we have created this great list of information, characteristics, and facts all about the Belgian Malinois. A large breed, they are built for athleticism. Their sleek, streamlined bodies adapt well to the rigor of intensive training. Given a firm hand, lots of training, and plenty of exercise, a Belgian Malinois can be quite the companion.

The Belgian Malinois is a herding breed of dog native to Belgium. It is amongst one amongst four Belgian Shepherd dogs, alongside the Groenendael, the Belgian Laekenois, and the Belgian Tervuren. It is named after the city Malines, where it was bred and developed in the late 1800s as a working dog and guard dog.
Though they may share certain similarities to the German Shepherd dog and are often cast in similar roles, they are not in fact related. The Belgian Malinois is an entirely separate breed that has completely different roots to its German counterpart, though they are both favored for similar work. The initial breeding of the Belgian Malinois was completely focussed around getting an ideal working and shepherding dog, and so there was no real focus put on creating a great family pet, as a result, they are not really a dog that would be recommended for a family setting.
The Belgian Malinois‚Äô arrival in the United States around 1911 provided the US with a perfect working dog for military applications when World War I hit in 1914, and so they rapidly gained popularity due to their reliability and hard-working determination. During the Great Depression, however, they became less prevalent due to a restriction on the importation of European breeding stock, but regained popularity once again around the 1950s. In 1959 the Belgian Malinois dog was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as belonging to the herding group and thus began their rapid ascent in the working world to high profile jobs such as becoming a police dog, a drug detection dog, search and a rescue dog, and a military dog. The Belgian Malinois breed is even employed by the US Secret Service as guard dogs to patrol the White House grounds.
Their steel nerves and solid determination make them ideal dogs for difficult and demanding careers, such as those in the special forces. They are even trained to wear night-vision goggles and body armor as well as skydiving! More recently that has found a place in the navy SEALS and anti-poaching organizations, and their usefulness only continues to expand, as we learn more and more about what this impressive breed is capable of.

Belgian Malinois are often mistaken for German Shepherds owing to their dark faces, fawn bodies, and general shape, however, that is where the similarities end. And if you were to look at a Malinois properly, you would notice that they are actually quite unique, especially in the face.
The Belgian Malinois is a large breed that can grow to be anywhere between 22 ‚Äì 26 inches depending on their gender, and thanks to their extremely muscular bodies, they are deceptively heavy, with males weighing up to 75 pounds!
Belgian Malinois don‚Äôt typically have a huge variation when it comes to their coat, but there are some key features that are worth knowing.
Though the Belgian Malinois is known for being tough, determined, and fiery, they actually have quite sweet and friendly faces. Malinois have long streamlined muzzles, with a rounded head and small, round, kind dark brown eyes, which give them quite a soulful look. The ‚Äúclean-cut‚Äù look of their face and head, along with their large, erect pointed ears, give them an alert expression that very well suits a working lifestyle.
Malinois are built for efficiency, meaning their bodies are a perfect balance of muscle and size. They carry themselves in a very proud and confident manner, showing off their broad powerful shoulders. They have been bred to herd, and so their body shape is streamlined, with a curved head and broad rounded shoulders, they become slightly narrower towards the back end.
Belgian Malinois also have large paws to cover more surface area and allow them to run further and faster with better footing. A Malinois should never be skinny and leggy, nor should they be too bulky or cumbersome.

Belgian Malinois are a very energetic breed, however, they can also be quite aloof and not the most sociable. Though they are quite often used for hunting and aggressive jobs they are not aggressive in temperament only when working. Because of their patient and hard-working nature, they are often used as guard dogs, and would not be recommended for somebody who wants a soft and cuddly pet.
Because of their high-energy temperament and extremely high IQs they can demand a lot of attention and often want to play and train for large portions of the day, and though Mals do may enjoy this form of social interaction, it can be easy to expect that they may want a fuss and cuddle afterward. However, their aloof tendencies will likely result in them wanting to go and lie down away from everyone else once they have run themselves ragged, so it is best to provide them with a space that they can call their own.
Belgian Malinois are not recommended for families with young children as they are a working dog, and whilst some working dogs may be perfectly well suited for family life the Belgian Malinois is predominantly meant to be used in demanding, and strict job roles Which make use of their boundless energy, eagerness to please and determination. Young children can often make the mistake of mishandling dogs, and though some domestic breeds are better suited for dealing with the stress of a child, the Malinois may lash out if mistreated, however unintentionally. This is not to say that the Malinois would attack your child, so much as nipping them by way of warning the child to back off.
If you do choose to have a Belgian Malinois in your home with young children you need to make sure that you socialize your dog as early as possible, with as many people as possible,, to help their confidence. You must also be absolutely sure that your child knows how to handle a dog and that they are not heavy-handed and harsh as some children can be.
Belgian Malinois are a protective breed and can be very suspicious of others, so it is not ideal to get a Belgian Malinois brought into a home with another pet. They can also have a tendency to chase smaller animals such as cats, due to their high prey-drive and shepherding instincts. If a Belgian Malinois is put into a home with another animal from puppydom they can be trained to get along with other animals much easier; this is also reliant on them being socialized correctly at a young age
A Belgian Malinois should never be shy, frightened, or aggressive; If you find this is the case you may want to look into what might be causing their distress. Many Belgian Malinois available are rescues, or even retired army dogs and so if you choose to adopt one of these, a shy, frightened, or aggressive demeanor could be the result of a highly stressful upbringing and a potential sign of PTSD.
If you have an ex-military dog suffering from PTSD you must be sure to address it with patience and care. Your veterinarian should be able to help you in terms of finding the right psychological help for your dog as well as perhaps providing anti-anxiety medications, and exploring alternative treatments.

Owning and raising a Belgian Malinois can be very difficult and demanding, and is not recommended for inexperienced owners. They are naturally rough around the edges but respond well to refinement in the form of training. Though they are sweet, friendly, and devoted to their owners, they also require guidance and socializing to make both theirs and their owner‚Äôs lives easier.
Belgian Malinois are made for training. They have been known to skydive, sniff out bombs, detect drugs and do all manners of difficult jobs due to effective training by their owner or handler. The key to training a Malinois is knowing the best approach, each dog can be different and you may find that one dog responds slightly better to clicker training perhaps than a whistle. You can use various methods to train your Malinois, but you must always ensure that you use a firm hand, that you are rigorous, and that you are consistent.
Obedience training is extremely important early in their development, without it you may well find a Mal quite difficult to live with. If you were to train your dog in nothing else the main form of training you will need to do is obedience training. Belgian Malinois respond very well to training in general but like any dog basic obedience training is essential. It is particularly important to teach your Malinois to leave objects when you tell them to as they have a strong prey drive and this can cause complications when trying to take items away from them. Not wanting to surrender items is quite common in many breeds that have a strong predatory instinct. You may also want to teach them some of the classics such as sit, heel, lie down, and come, for day-to-day use.
If you were to choose to own a Belgian Malinois one form of training you may wish to consider is agility training. Agility training would exercise both their boundless energy and their minds, as they are extremely intelligent and require plenty of mental stimulation. Successful agility training relies on rapid response and fast thinking on the dog‚Äôs part, perfect for a high-energy, sharp-minded breed such as a Malinois. You must keep in mind that agility training requires plenty of repetition and consistency; It is something you would want to do at least once a week and try and practice at home where possible. Agility training also tests the connection between owner/handler and dog as there is a lot of trust required on both sides, so if you were to pursue agility training you would find that it would likely strengthen the bond between yourself and your dog.
Obedience with agility training is all well and good but at the end of the day Malinois are working dogs and so the best thing you could do would be to give them a job. By giving your Belgian sheepdog a job it will keep them active and stimulated throughout the day and save you the trouble of needing to do too much training outside those hours. In fact, you will likely find that working will wear them out, and they would be much calmer at the end of the day.
Malinois are a lean and muscular breed meaning their diet needs to be rich in protein to provide them with plenty of restorative energy to help their muscles to recover at the end of a long working day. Large breed dogs typically have a slower metabolism, so you want to be looking for food with a lower caloric density per pound, this way they will be able to eat plenty of food to fill their stomachs without eating too many calories and gaining weight.
Excessive weight gain is very risky with large breed dogs who are often predisposed to joint problems, which can be exacerbated if they are forced to carry around more weight than they need to. Overweight dogs are also less able to exercise, meaning they will experience difficulty shedding the weight they have gained.
Take a look at our guides on the Best Dog Food for German Shepherds and Best Large Breed Dog Foods.
Belgian Malinois only have a short coat which is thicker around the neck and tail, so they don‚Äôt require a lot of grooming, with only needing brushing perhaps once a week. Though it is worth noting that they do also drop their coats twice a year, and when this happens their fur will be absolutely everywhere and will require brushing several times a week until the shedding period is over. The time in which they drop their coats tends to settle around spring and autumn with the major changes of the season.
Thanks to their short coats they don‚Äôt often require bathing unless they have got something on their fur which can only be removed with a bath. Their coat is naturally very sleek, and so will not withhold day-to-day grime, which means that so long as you keep on top of brushing them, general dirt will be removed with ease if it does not fall away on its own. They are generally considered a low-maintenance breed when it comes to grooming for exactly this reason, though that opinion can change during the shedding season.
Generally speaking, Belgian Malinois dogs are a strong and healthy breed, just another thing that makes them such a popular working dog. But like any dog, they have predispositions to several health problems that they may develop as they get older particularly as large breed dog‚Äôs bones can be quite troublesome in old age. You may well find that you have a perfectly healthy Belgian Malinois that never experiences any health problems, but it is important to be clear on the possibilities and how to recognize when there may be a problem arising:
Epilepsy: Sadly Belgian Malinois, much like the Dutch Shepherd, can be known to suffer from epilepsy. Epilepsy¬†includes seizures, fits, reactive seizures, and convulsions. It is unfortunately unknown where epilepsy stems from in the Malinois DNA, but it is believed at this time to be an inherited disease. If your pet‚Äôs breed is known for being high risk with Epilepsy, it is best to watch them carefully for any signs of a fit, and speak with your veterinarian about how best to deal with a seizure, should one happen. But most importantly in that instance, stay calm.
Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a hereditary condition that affects the thigh bone in the way it fits into the hip joint. Pets are most commonly affected by this as they get older and it can result in discomfort, pain, lameness, and in more severe cases, an inability to walk altogether. Whilst hip dysplasia may not always be obvious with some puppies not exhibiting any signs of possibly developing this problem, it can be triggered by environmental factors such as an impact injury or even rapid growth which can be the result of a high-calorie diet. There are surgeries that can be performed in more severe cases to help with this condition, or in less severe cases there are treatments and medications available that may help your dog to navigate day-to-day life more easily.
Elbow Joint Dysplasia: Malinois‚Äô elbows are also prone to a type of dysplasia that affects the elbow joint, this can cause painful lameness as well as joint laxity. Though there is no cure, preventive medication, or easy fix for this, there are treatments and medications available that may help your dog to deal with the pain and make them more comfortable. Older Malinois, in particular, tend to experience dysplasia problems.
Progessive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): Progressive Retinal Atrophy is a degenerative condition that results in a loss of sight, caused by a loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. This condition is detectable several years prior to your dog revealing any sign that they may be losing their sight, however, there is, unfortunately, no cure. Fortunately, pets such as dogs and cats are able to adapt much more easily to losing their sight than humans, as they are extremely attuned to their environment, and are able to use their ultra-powered senses to adjust.
Anesthetic Sensitivity: This is not so much a condition as it is a warning, Belgian Malinois sensitivity when it comes to anesthetic, and sp anytime a Malinois is being prepared for surgery the veterinarian should be made aware of this sensitivity.
Dental Disease: No more so than any other dog, but absolutely worth noting, is dental disease. To avoid gum disease, tooth loss, and severe pain you must be sure to keep your Malinois mouth as clean as possible. Dental disease can cause severe complications if a problem is left to become infected and so it is best to take good care of your dog‚Äôs teeth early on and continue to look after them throughout their life to avoid these complications in the future.
General Allergies: Allergies are commonplace with dogs, most common of all being wheat, dairy, pollen, soy and gluten. These allergies often cause skin irritation, itching and if left for long enough, hair loss. Fortunately, they can often be solved with the use of an antihistamine or a change of diet, but if an allergy seems particularly persistent or severe, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask your vet for advice.
Health problems to any degree are inevitable throughout your pet‚Äôs lifetime, and so it is imperative that you make sure to get pet health insurance from the moment you bring them home. Not only will this ensure your pet gets the care they need, but you will be covering your own back in the process.
Malinois seemingly have an endless source of energy, and so when it comes to exercising them you need to be sure that you are taking them out for long walks preferably doing tasks such as hiking, which can give them the mental stimulation of finding a path through difficult terrain, as well as the physical stimulation of climbing. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre unable to do something like hiking you can pursue agility training, another rich source of exercise which you can provide them with the mental stimulation that they require. These types of high-energy, trust-reliant activities can also be beneficial in strengthening the bond between you and your dog.
Fortunately, the Belgian Malinois breed is highly adept at a wide range of activities, hence their eclectic working background, and so if you were to have another activity in mind which you may consider to be too difficult for a dog you will likely find that your Malinois will take to it well.
Belgian Malinois are far too often bought by owners that are not prepared to put in the work that it takes to raise them right, and so more and more of them are finding themselves in shelters and rescues. By buying a dog you‚Äôre only encouraging more breeders to continue to develop that breed, But when that breed is proving to be problematic in domestic environments (with unprepared or inexperienced owners) and is therefore constantly being given up to shelters, we should be focused on adopting those that have lost their homes due to irresponsible ownership.
If you have the time and the patience and are willing to put in the dedication that is needed, you may want to consider rescuing an ex-military dog. K9 units and ex-military dogs tend to suffer from mental health problems such as PTSD and other anxiety disorders as a result of their time serving, and so they require a little bit of extra TLC to help them to adapt to life outside of that service. To adopt an ex-service dog you need to be prepared to learn the commands and training that they have grown up with and be able to continue using and adapting these commands for the remainder of their life.
There are several non-profit organizations dedicated to the rehabilitation and rehoming Belgian Malinois throughout the United States and Canada:
Please, try to adopt wherever possible, these dogs didn‚Äôt have a choice in becoming homeless, but you have a choice in changing that, and giving them a loving new home.
The price of a Belgian Malinois depends on whether you decide to go with an untrained puppy or a fully trained protection dog.
Untrained Belgian Malinois puppies from a reputable breeder can cost anywhere between $1,000 and $2,500 depending on the parentage. If your Belgian Malinois puppy comes from a champion bloodline or is purebred with proof from breeders, then the cost of the puppy can double.
Fully trained Belgian Malinois dogs used for protection can be anywhere up to $20,000. This is owing to the fact that it can take several years to train a puppy to be a high-standard protection dog, and you are paying for the convenience of not having to train the puppy yourself and being sure that the training has been done to a proper and high standard.

A: The Belgian Malinois is a very boisterous breed, which if not trained correctly can prove to be quite troublesome, therefore they are not really a breed that would be recommended as a family pet. Though Malinois do form strong bonds with their families and are loyal to a fault, if they are not socialized correctly they can become stressed and irritable with young children. Particularly for first-time owners, Mals are a breed that should be avoided, as there are many other much easier breeds to bring into a family home.
A: The nickname ‚ÄúMaligator‚Äù has stemmed from their fierce reputation in the K9 world. Malinois have been utilized in various military, police, and special force operations going all the way back to WW1 and so it is to be expected that they gained a reputation for being fearful, aggressive, unstoppable machines. This particular nickname has resurfaced following a recent anti-terrorist raid in which a Belgian Malinois by the name of Conan saved the day!
A: Whilst a Belgian Malinois can be friendly, playful, funny, mischievous, loyal, and loving, they are not big cuddlers. Though of course, every dog has its own personality and it‚Äôs guaranteed there are some out there that love a good snuggle, on average a Malinois will demand your attention for playtime, and then be quite happy to sit back and relax in their own little space afterward.
A: Short answer, yes. German Shepherd and Belgian Shepherds may look alike, though contrary to what you may believe they do not actually share any genealogical traits and come from completely separate backgrounds. So whilst people may think that the German Shepherd must be related to the Belgian Shepherd based on looks alone, they are in fact completely wrong.
A: It all comes down to the way they were bred. Belgian Malinois was bred to be the best working dog they could be; so they are strong, determined, brave, eager to please, streamlined, efficient, and incredibly intelligent. Their bravery, intelligence, and determination have served to show that they are capable of working very demanding jobs and following instructions to the letter, making them a trustworthy and reliable K9 to work with.
A: In terms of grooming, no not particularly, but in terms of raising them, yes absolutely. Grooming a Malinois is a simple case of brushing them once every few weeks (except when they‚Äôre blowing their coat). But raising a Malinois is an entirely different ball game and the reason why we don‚Äôt recommend them for homes with children. Belgian Malinois are highly active, demanding, extremely intelligent, and occasionally temperamental, so you need to know how to handle one before committing to raising one.
A: Absolutely. Unless you specifically intend to breed your dog, you should always have them neutered or spayed. Unspayed and unneutered pets can have a tendency to become unpredictable and potentially aggressive during their mating seasons, which puts you or your family at risk. You should also always look to avoid unwanted pregnancies wherever possible, as there are already too many dogs in shelters due to reckless ownership.

The history of the Belgian Malinois is not widely known before the late 1800s. However, it is believed that these dogs have been assisting shepherds in caring for their flocks for many centuries. In the 1890s, a professor named Adolphe Reul noticed similarities among several emerging dog breeds in Belgium. He grouped these similar dogs together and called them Belgian Shepherds. Among these shepherds, there was a particular variation that was believed to have originated from Malines, and this variation came to be known as the Belgian Malinois.
According to historical records, one of the first registered dogs of this breed was a dog named Charlot, born in 1891. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1911, but they referred to them as Belgian Sheepdogs without distinguishing the different varieties. It was not until 1959 that the Belgian Shepherd varieties were officially separated, with the Belgian Malinois being placed in the Miscellaneous Class. Finally, in 1965, the breed was fully recognized by the American Kennel Club. Over time, the Belgian Malinois gained popularity as a herding dog and their exceptional skills were also utilized in police and military work. However, compared to other Belgian breeds, the Belgian Malinois has not gained as much popularity as a competitive show dog outside of Belgium.

The Belgian Malinois breed may weigh up to 65 pounds for females and 80 pounds for men, giving the dog the appearance of being square-shaped rather frequently. Dogs of this breed have powerful hindquarters and front legs that are straight and athletic. This powerful and competent dog has tall, trapezoidal ears and an upright-held head. The mouth features strong jaws and a level, scissors-bite-shaped intersection of teeth. This active dog has a long tail that curls upward and is usually held horizontally or downward.

When reared around cats and other dogs, your puppy can get along with them well, although they may come out as a bit pushy. Some dogs may not be safe among cats owing to their high prey drive depending on the specific breed.

They will become more confident when socialized effectively. They may be extroverted or reserved when meeting individuals outside the family, but they won‚Äôt be timid or hostile. Even at the age of eight weeks, training may begin the day they are brought home by you.
