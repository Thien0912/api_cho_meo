Salukis are intuitive and intelligent. They become very devoted to their humans and prefer the companionship of their family to being left outdoors or in a kennel. Despite their unpampered nomadic history, Salukis may be described as “sybaritic” – appreciating luxury and physical comfort. They enjoy very vigorous outdoor activities as well as lying quietly on a soft bed indoors. They are naturally clean and integrate easily into family life.
The Saluki is a sighthound that has been carefully bred for thousands of years to have a keenly developed hunting instinct. Populations of desert-bred Salukis used for hunting still exist in the Middle East. Its movement and outline are graceful, suggesting speed, endurance and strength. Its expression is dignified, aristrocratic and regal. Large oval, dark to hazel coloured eyes give the Saluki a far-seeing gentle expression.
Salukis can be found depicted in ancient artifacts and images around the world.
Breed Standard: Need Link
The Saluki is one of the oldest known breeds of dogs. It has existed, virtually unchanged, for many thousands of years. It was originally bred by the Arab tribesmen for bringing down game and was considered a sacred gift of God by the tribesmen. In Arabic, an ordinary dog is called kelb while the Saluki is El Hor, The Noble One.
The whole appearance of this breed should give an impression of grace and symmetry and of great speed and endurance, coupled with strength and activity to enable it to kill gazelle or other quarry over deep sand or rocky mountains. The expression should be dignified and gentle, with deep, faithful, far-seeing eyes.
Dogs should average in height from 23-28 inches (58-71 cm), and bitches may be considerably smaller, this being very typical of the breed.
Smooth and of a soft silky texture, slight feather on the legs, feather at the back of the thighs and sometimes with slight woolly feather on the thigh and shoulder.
White, cream, fawn, golden, red, grizzle and tan tricolour (white, black and tan), black and tan, or any of the aforementioned colours and white.
Long and narrow. Skull moderately wide between the ears, not domed, stop not pronounced, the whole showing great quality. Nose:  black or liver. Teeth strong and level; eyes dark to hazel and bright large and oval, but not prominent; ears long and covered with long silky hair,hanging close to the skull and mobile.
Long, supple, and well muscled.
Shoulders sloping and set well back, well muscled without being coarse. Forelegs straight and long from the elbow to the knee.
Back fairly broad, muscles slightly arched over loin. Chest deep and moderately narrow
Strong, hip bones set well apart and stifle moderately bent, hocks low to the ground, showing galloping and jumping power.
Of moderate length, toes long and well arched, not splayed out but at the same time not cat- footed; the whole being strong and supple and well feathered between the toes.
Long, set on low and carried naturally in a curve, well feathered on the underside with long, silky hair, not bushy.
In this variety, the points should be the same with the exception of the coat which has no feathering.

Before bringing your new Saluki home, take the time to research the breed, think about your lifestyle, and how you’ll meet their needs as a puppy, adult, and senior. Be ready for the responsibilities of owning a sighthound that is both sensitive and active by talking to reputable Saluki breeders, owners, or breed clubs to learn more from those with firsthand experience.

Salukis are exotic, beautiful, and spirited. They are clean, do not shed much, and draw lots of attention when taken for a walk in the neighborhood. But they are also hunters with thousands of years of purposeful breeding behind them. They will run after anything that is fuzzy and moves and will sometimes catch and kill their targets. Salukis are not to be trusted off leash in an unsafe area. Also, Salukis are much too fast and clever to catch if they accidentally sneak out the door. Salukis tend to sleep on beds, sofas, and chairs rather than on floors. Gentle, dignified and independent, Salukis are sensitive and reserved. They respond best to positive training methods. Kindness and patience are always the best approach.

Owning a Saluki can be rewarding, but it’s important to be aware of their breed’s specific needs and characteristics. Here are some considerations:
Done on a regular basis, these maintenance jobs will keep your dog in good health and reduce the need for visits to the clinic. Your veterinarian or breeder can show you how these are done.
Temperament: Salukis are known to be gentle and reserved. Being sensitive, they respond best to positive, reward-based training techniques. Harsh methods are to be avoided.

Prey Drive: As mentioned above, Salukis have a strong prey drive and will chase nearly anything that moves or runs away from them. So be extra careful with your Saluki around smaller animals. Off-leash walks should be done in secure areas, and interactions with smaller pets should be supervised.
Living With You: Breeders recommend that your Saluki has a home with a yard with a secure, high fence, 6’ or higher, that offers adequate room for running at speed.   Keeping your Saluki healthy through exercise is a large commitment as they do need a secure outdoor space to run, a safe beach, or those long walks. In the home, they generally are very “catlike” — perching on a chair to gaze out your window or curled up on the couch after a good run.
Your Companion: Salukis will form strong bonds with their people and thrive on companionship. He/she may experience anxiety if left alone for extended periods while learning to live in the new home. Begin with your Saluki being safely crated for short sessions of a few minutes while you leave. Over time, work your way up to longer and longer periods. There are plenty of books and websites offering positive-reinforcement, crate-training methods. Eventually, you should be able to leave your mature Saluki in the house or yard without worrying about anxiety destruction.
Ambient Temperatures: Because of their fine body fur and lack of an insulating fat layer, Salukis may be sensitive to extreme cold and heat. In the cold, they may need a coat and in very hot weather it’s important to provide water and shade and avoid strenuous activity. You should allow them to rest, just as you would after exertion on a hot day.
Breed-Specific Activities: Salukis often enjoy running activities. One popular sport is lure coursing, where hounds (utilizing their natural prey drive) chase an artificial lure around a grassy course.  Participating in dog sports or activities, such as rally, agility, obedience, flyball, and even dock-diving, that engage their physical and mental abilities can be fulfilling for both of you. You’ll meet other like-minded sighthound owners and develop friends and a community. Activities with your Saluki
Commitment as an Owner: Salukis generally live a long life, often into their early to mid-teens —or even longer. You should be committed to meeting your dog’s needs throughout his/her life. After all, they would do it for you. The number one killer of young Salukis is being hit by a car, which is why we stress finding safe areas for them to run. Most Salukis eventually die from standard old age illnesses such as cancer or congestive heart failure.

Basepaws analyzes this breed as part of the Saluki and Tazi Lineage
The Saluki, also known as the Persian Greyhound or the Gazelle Hound, is one of the oldest known breeds of domesticated dogs. Salukis were originally bred in the Fertile Crescent, the cradle of civilization that extends through parts of the present-day Middle East, including modern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and parts of Iran and Turkey. The breed's name comes from the ancient city of Saluk, in Yemen, although its historical origins are up for debate. They were bred for speed, strength, and endurance, traits needed for hunting in harsh desert environments. Salukis are even mentioned in the Bible and depicted on Egyptian tombs dating back to 2100 B.C.
Salukis are known to be generally healthy dogs, but as a larger breed they are at risk for developing orthopedic problems, such as hip and elbow dysplasia. Genetic testing is recommended, including for the following specific conditions: hyperuricosoria, degenerative myelopathy, and progressive rod-cone degeneration.
Salukis are known for their intelligence, independence, and aloofness. They can be reserved, even with family, and are typically cautious around strangers. Despite their aloof nature, Salukis require a good amount of love and companionship from their families. They're gentle and affectionate, but not overly demonstrative. Salukis have a strong instinct to chase and should not be trusted off-leash in an unfenced area, as they may not be able to resist the urge to chase after small animals.
Salukis have two types of coats - smooth and "feathered". The feathered Saluki has silky flowing hair on the ears, tail, and the backs of the legs. The smooth variety, as the name suggests, has short hair all over. The Saluki is often called a "gazelle hound" due to its incredible speed and agility. It can reach speeds up to 42 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest dog breeds.Despite their high energy and athleticism, Salukis are often described as "cat-like" due to their independent and aloof nature.In their native Middle East, Salukis are so highly esteemed that they're often considered "clean" dogs, according to Islamic dietary laws, which is a significant honor in Muslim culture.
