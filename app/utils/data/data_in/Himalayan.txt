If you’re looking for the ultimate cuddle companion, the beautiful and gentle Himalayan cat might be the new friend for you. With their gorgeous blue eyes and love of snuggling in laps, the Himalayan is popular and well-known around the world. In this article, you’ll learn about Himalayan cats, including their temperament and traits.

You’re not entirely wrong if you think the Himalayan cat looks like a much fluffier Siamese. The breed was developed by crossing the Siamese and the long-haired, flat-faced Persian. Thanks to this ancestry, the Himalayan retains the Persian’s smooshed face (for better or worse) and the Siamese’s characteristic coloring.
They’re also much calmer than a Siamese but more playful than the sedate Persian. Keep reading to learn more about the Himalayan cat, including the health issues to be aware of and what you can expect when owning one.

Himalayans are one of the most popular purebred cats, and you’ll most likely have several options for acquiring a kitten. If you choose to buy from a breeder, research the available sellers carefully. Himalayans are prone to several genetic health conditions, and responsible breeders will screen for common medical problems. They’ll also be transparent about any concerning health history in your Himalayan kitten’s family tree.
Try to choose a breeder in your area so you can visit the kittens and their parents at home. This also makes picking up your new kitten in person easier and safer. If you prefer to adopt a Himalayan, look for purebred cat rescues in your area.
You might even be able to find a Himalayan at your local animal shelter. However, adopting a Himalayan kitten might be harder than finding an adult cat. Once your Himalayan kitten is home, start establishing routines early.
As a laidback breed, the Himalayan cat does best with other pets and kids if allowed to meet and socialize with them at an early age. Start your kitten on a healthy diet and provide plenty of opportunities for exercise and play.

Himalayan cats have a temperament that’s easy to love. They love to snuggle in your lap and accept all your affection. Although they can be playful, Himalayans aren’t overly active cats. This makes them a good fit for elderly owners who can’t keep up with the physical demands of other pets.
Himalayans are considered intelligent cats and can be trained to follow commands or perform tricks. However, they aren’t always the most motivated, which can make training more challenging. Himalayans are usually adaptable cats but may become overwhelmed by excessively busy or noisy living environments. However, they’re usually social and friendly even with people they don’t know.
They thrive on daily attention and won’t be happy if they don’t spend time with their humans frequently.
With their gentle, calm temperaments, Himalayans can make excellent family pets. However, as we mentioned, they prefer a quieter home environment that suits their mellow demeanor. Large, active families may be better off choosing a more outgoing cat that is tolerant of intermittent chaos.
Himalayans can do well with children but don’t enjoy the noise and rough handling of younger kids. Families with older children are a better fit for Himalayans. Busy families should also remember that a Himalayan needs more daily attention, especially for grooming, than some other breeds.
If introduced and socialized properly, Himalayans can live happily with other cats and calm dogs. They probably won’t enjoy spending time with active puppies or energetic older dogs. Make sure your Himalayan has a quiet place to escape if they live in a house with other pets, especially dogs.
Himalayans don’t have the strongest hunting instincts and may not bother birds or other small exotic pets. However, small animals can become dangerously stressed by just the presence of a predator, which includes your cat. For safety, keep a Himalayan away from any exotic pets.

They may not have demanding personalities, but Himalayans require more daily care than many other breeds. Before you bring one of these fluffy kitties home, here’s what you need to know when owning a Himalayan.
Healthy Himalayan cats can eat any nutritionally balanced diet formulated for felines. Some Himalayans may suffer from medical issues that require a special diet. Because they aren’t very active cats, Himalayans can become overweight easily.
It can also be hard to tell if they are getting too large because of their fluffy coats. Ask your vet to help you calculate precisely how many calories your Himalayan should eat and portion their food accordingly.
As we’ve discussed, Himalayans aren’t overly active cats and don’t enjoy climbing like other breeds. Daily playtime is ideal for maintaining your bond with your cat and ensuring they stay physically and mentally sharp.
Himalayans like playing with teasers and other interactive toys that allow them to spend time with their owners. More social Himalayans like to get their exercise by playing with other pets in the family. You can buy puzzle toys for self-guided entertainment to keep them busy while you’re away.
Most cats don’t need much training beyond learning to use a litter box. However, Himalayans enjoy learning tricks and commands, especially if it means being the center of attention. Positive, reward-based training will always be the most effective for this gentle breed. However, not all Himalayan cats are food-motivated, which can make training a bit more complicated.
Himalayans are famous for their gorgeous coats, but maintaining them requires a daily commitment. They have a double coat and shed frequently. You’ll need to brush your Himalayan daily to prevent mats and keep the shedding under control. They require regular bathing, too, especially if they suffer from allergies or other skin conditions.
As a flat-faced breed, Himalayans often have excessive tear staining or eye discharge. Facial cleaning and eye care may also need to be part of the daily grooming routine. Like many cats, Himalayans can suffer from dental disease.
Due to their short faces, brushing their teeth properly can be challenging, so ask your vet about other preventative dental care strategies to keep your Himalayan’s mouth healthy. Also, check their ears regularly for excessive wax, dirt, or signs of infection.
Like many purebred cats and dogs, Himalayans are prone to several genetic health problems. Only buy a Himalayan kitten from a breeder who screens their animals for these conditions before breeding and offers a health guarantee. Talk to your vet about keeping your pet healthy and minimizing the risks of suffering severe medical conditions.
Male and female Himalayan cats have similar personalities, but males are usually larger. In general, unneutered male cats are more vocal than females and are more likely to spray and show aggression towards other kitties. Unspayed females will go into heat regularly and may become moody and vocal during those periods.
You can consult your vet about spaying or neutering your Himalayan cat if you don’t plan to breed them. If you are interested in breeding, remember the health issues that Himalayans are prone to. Don’t contribute to the problem by breeding your cat irresponsibly and not screening them first.

Some purebred cat registries consider the Himalayan a variation of a Persian rather than a separate breed. In fact, they are called the “Colorpoint Persian” in the U.K.
In the mid-20th century, a cat breeder in the U.K. spent 10 years diligently crossbreeding Siamese and Persian cats to create the Himalayan, first recognized in 1955. Another breeder in the United States was able to get the Himalayan officially recognized by the Cat Fancier’s Association (CFA) 2 years later.
Due to their sweet nature and intelligence, several Himalayan cats have starred on the big screen. Mr. Jinx is the memorable feline co-star in Meet the Parents and its sequels. And who can forget beautiful Sassy, who treks through the wilderness with her canine friends in Homeward Bound?

Quiet, affectionate, and loving Himalayans are well-suited to various living situations. However, hectic households with multiple children and pets may need to look elsewhere for a feline companion. Himalayans may not be a good choice for people with allergies or those who prefer a cat with less demanding grooming needs, but they’re ideal for families who prefer friendly, calm pets.
Searching for a responsible breeder is always crucial, but it’s especially important for a breed like the Himalayan, which is prone to multiple inherited health conditions.

The Himalayan cat is a long-haired breed who has a sweet temperament and striking appearance. They are a cross between Persian and Siamese cats and have the best qualities of both breeds. Himalayans have the dense, luxurious coat of a Persian and the distinctive colorpoint markings of a Siamese. Their eyes are always a brilliant blue, and their noses and paws are typically darker than the rest of their body.
Himalayans, also called Himmies, are generally gentle and affectionate cats. They are for good with children and other pets. Himalayans are also relatively low-maintenance cats but require regular grooming to prevent their coats from becoming matted.
Some cat breeds are typically independent and aloof, even if they’ve been raised by the same person since kittenhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn’t the only factor that goes into affection levels; cats who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily.

If you’re going to share your home with a cat, you’ll need to deal with some level of cat hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary among the breeds. If you’re a neatnik, you’ll need to either pick a low-shedding breed or relax your standards. This furniture cover can make it easier to clean up cat hair and keep it off your sofa!

Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems. This doesn’t mean that every cat of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they’re at an increased risk. If you’re looking only for purebred cats or kittens, it’s a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you’re interested in.

Some cats are perpetual kittens—full of energy and mischief—while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful kitten sounds endearing, consider how many games of chase the mouse-toy you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other animals who can stand in as playmates. A classic wand cat toy like this one is perfect for playful felines!

Being tolerant of children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a nonchalant attitude toward running, screaming youngsters are all traits that make a kid-friendly cat. Our ratings are generalizations, and they’re not a guarantee of how any breed or individual cat will behave; cats from any breed can be good with children based on their past experiences and personality.

Stranger-friendly cats will greet guests with a curious glance or a playful approach; others are shy or indifferent, perhaps even hiding under furniture or skedaddling to another room. However, no matter what the breed, a cat who was exposed to lots of different types, ages, sizes, and shapes of people as a kitten will respond better to strangers as an adult.

The Himalayan cat, also known as the Himmie, is a man-made breed developed by crossing Persians with Siamese to bring in the color points and blue eyes of the Siamese.
Breeders began to work towards this goal in 1931 when cat breeder Virginia Cobb and Harvard Medical School researcher Clyde Keeler started selective breeding to develop longhaired cats with the distinctive color points of the Siamese. The first kitten to be called a Himalayan was named Newton’s Debutante.
In the 1950s, British and North American breeders became interested in achieving a Siamese-pointed Persian. They started with the Cobb-Keeler “recipe” to get the colorpoint pattern and then bred the cats back to Persians to establish breed type. Once the cats bred true, they sought recognition as a breed.
Whether the Himalayan is considered a variety of Persian or a distinct breed depends on which cat association you talk to. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized the Himalayan as a distinct breed in 1957, but in 1984 the CFA Board of Directors decided to reclassify the Himalayan as a color variety of the Persian.
The American Cat Association also considers the Himalayan a color variety of the Persian, and The International Cat Association recognizes the Himmie as a member of its “Persian Group,” which includes the Persian and the Exotic Shorthair. In other registries, including the American Association of Cat Enthusiasts, the American Cat Fanciers Association, and the Traditional Cat Association, the Himalayan is classified separately from the Persian.
Himalayans may be outcrossed to Persians or, in some associations, Exotic Shorthairs, but the Siamese is no longer a part of the Himalayan breeding program. And today, no matter what he’s called, the Himmie is among the most popular pedigreed cats.
Himalayan cats are a medium to large-sized breed. On average, they typically weigh between 7 to 12 pounds (3.2 to 5.4 kg) and stand about 9 to 10 inches (23 to 25 cm) tall at the shoulder. Their size can vary slightly based on gender, genetics, and individual differences, but they are generally known for their sturdy build and luxurious, long fur.

Himalayan cats are known for their gentle, affectionate, and docile personalities. They are often described as being “lap cats” because they love to cuddle and be petted. Himalayans are also relatively quiet cats, and they are not known for being overly active. They are content to relax on their owners’ laps or follow them around the house.
Here are some of the key personality traits of Himalayan cats:
If you are looking for a loving, affectionate, and docile cat, then the Himalayan may be the perfect breed for you. They are relatively low-maintenance cats, but they do require regular grooming. With proper care, Himalayans can live long and happy lives.
Here are some additional facts about Himalayan cats:
Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Although they are beautiful and sweet, Exotics are prone to a number of potential health problems, most commonly related to their facial structure:
The most important thing to understand about caring for a Himalayan cat is that they require daily grooming. Their long, beautiful coat does not stay clean and tangle-free on its own. It must be gently but thoroughly combed every day, and regular bathing (at least once a month) is a good idea.
Another factor to consider is the litter box issue. Litter may become lodged in a Himalayan’s paws or coat. If the cat and the litter box are not kept scrupulously clean, a Himmie is more likely than most to just stop using the box.
Excessive tearing can be a problem in this breed, so wipe the corners of the eyes clean daily to prevent under-eye stains from forming. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing.
It is a good idea to keep a Himalayan cat as an indoor-only cat. They are not scrappers and would fare poorly against other cats, dogs, coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors. Himalayans who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
The Himalayan cat shares the Persian’s sweet expression and soft round lines. It has a large, round head; large, round eyes; a short nose; full cheeks; and small ears with rounded tips. The head is supported by a short, thick neck and a deceptively sturdy, muscular body. Its legs are short, thick, and strong with large, round, firm paws. The tail is short but proportional to the length of the cat’s body.
A Himalayan’s coat is long, thick, shiny, and fine-textured. It is long all over the body and includes an immense ruff around the neck, a deep frill between the front legs, long ear and toe tufts, and a full “brush,” or tail.
The Himalayan is bred in the following point colors: chocolate, seal, lilac, blue, red, cream tortie, blue-cream, chocolate-tortie, lilac-cream, seal lynx, blue lynx, red lynx, cream lynx, tortie lynx, blue-cream lynx, chocolate lynx, lilac lynx, chocolate-tortie lynx, and lilac-cream lynx. The body is various shades of white to fawn with color only on the facial mask and the feet, ears, and tail.
Unlike the Persian and the Exotic, the Himalayan’s eyes come in only one color: a deep, vivid blue.
Himalayans come in two different “looks,” known as extreme and traditional. Extreme Himalayans, those seen in the show ring, have a flatter face, which may come with breathing problems. Cats with the traditional look have a more old-fashioned appearance, with a face that is not as flat and a nose that is set lower on the face with more of a “break,” permitting easier breathing. They are registered by the Traditional Cat Association.
Himalayan cats are not the best choice for a houseful of boisterous children and dogs. They are gentle and docile cats who prefer a quiet and serene environment. However, they do not mind being the object of gentle attention from children, as long as the children are respectful of the cat’s boundaries.
If you have children, it is important to teach them how to interact with a Himalayan cat in a way that is safe and comfortable for both the cat and the child. For example, children should be taught to avoid pulling the cat’s tail or ears, and they should not try to pick up the cat unless the cat is clearly comfortable with being picked up.
Himalayan cats can also get along well with friendly dogs, as long as the dog is not aggressive or overly playful. If you have a dog, it is important to introduce the dog to the cat slowly and carefully, and to supervise their interactions closely at first.
Here are some tips for introducing a Himalayan cat to a child or dog:
If you are considering getting a Himalayan cat, it is important to think about your lifestyle and your family’s needs. If you have young children or a lot of noise and activity in your home, a Himalayan cat may not be the best fit for you. However, if you are looking for a gentle and loving companion who enjoys being around people, a Himalayan cat could be the perfect pet for you.

Cat Breeds
Is the Himalayan a Persian cat? Is the Colorpoint Persian the same as a Himalayan? The answer varies depending on the breed registry. Some organizations view the Himalayan—fondly nicknamed the Himmie—as a Persian color variant and others classify the Himalayan as its own separate breed.
Himalayans or Colorpoint Persian cats have pointed markings and gorgeous blue eyes like Siamese cats. At the same time, they possess long, silky coats like their Persian cousins. In addition, that Persian influence means Himalayans typically have flat or shortened faces that contribute to their unique appearance.
Most Himalayan cats are incredibly sweet natured, with a fondness for cuddling up to their favorite people. Thanks to their Siamese heritage, these cats tend to be a bit more playful than the average Persian. If you are looking for a cat that loves to lounge and you don't mind daily grooming sessions, then the Himalayan might be your perfect feline companion.
Himalayan cats have no special nutritional needs, but like all other cats, the Himalayan thrives on a high-quality diet that includes real meat or fish as the first ingredient. You might wish to look for food that contains added omega essential fatty acids to support skin and coat health.
Long, luxurious fur calls for daily grooming sessions, which Himalayan cats typically enjoy. Not only does daily brushing prevent mats from forming, it is a wonderful bonding ritual. Some Himalayan cats require daily facial care to remove tear staining. This is more common in individuals with flatter faces and facial folds that catch moisture as it travels down from the tear ducts.
Additional grooming rituals include regular nail trims and toothbrushing, along with ear cleaning. Some Himalayan cats are prone to oily skin and hair, making occasional baths necessary.
Because the Himalayan cats are prone to obesity, it is very important to encourage daily exercise. Luckily, these cats enjoy intense play and come to look forward to it once it is a habit. Just like Siamese, Himalayan cats enjoy interactive games like fetch and will happily chase a laser beam (just be sure not to shine the laser into your cat's eyes).
If you have a cat with a very flat face, you might need to reduce the speed and intensity of your play sessions to help prevent shortness of breath.
Himalayan cats are generally healthy, however, some do carry the gene for polycystic kidney disease. Responsible breeders test for PKD, greatly reducing the likelihood of producing kittens that are prone to the disease.
Since Himalayan cats are brachycephalic, with flattened faces, they can suffer from brachycephalic airway syndrome, which can cause breathing difficulties. Some Himalayan cats also have dental malocclusions, along with cherry eye, which can occur in any breed with eyes that protrude.
Some individuals suffer from feline hyperesthesia syndrome (twitch-skin syndrome), which is a nervous system disorder that can cause a wide range of uncomfortable symptoms.
A common heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is also seen in Himalayan cats.
None of these issues are prevalent and most Himalayan breeders are careful to pair only the healthiest parents with the hope of preventing heritable diseases from plaguing offspring.
During the 1930s, two Harvard researchers named Dr. Clyde Keeler and Virginia Cobb decided to conduct a study by combining Siamese and Persian cats. Their efforts led to the birth of a cat named Newton's Debutante. They simply called it a Siamese–Persian after its parents. This beautiful cat had classic Siamese colorpoint markings, blue eyes, and a long, silky coat. He ultimately became one of the first cats to represent the Himalayan (Colorpoint Persian) breed.
Cat breeder and conservationist Jean Mill, also known as the founder of the Bengal cat breed, began working on the breed in 1948.
In 1955, Brian Sterling-Webb created a similar crossbred cat that he called the Long-Haired Colorpoint. In 1957, Marguerita Goforth's continued efforts at combining Siamese and Persian cats gained breed recognition from the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Goforth is credited with naming the Himalayan cat breed.
Outcrossing to both Siamese and Persian cats continued throughout the next few decades, with various breeders focusing on either Persian or Siamese traits. In 1984, the CFA decided that the Himalayan cat was actually a Persian variant and many of today's Himalayans exhibit more Persian traits than Siamese traits.
All major cat registries recognize the breed, using either the Himalayan name or the Colorpoint Persian name. Despite the labeling conundrum that pits the Himalayan versus the Colorpoint Persian, both breeds are exactly the same.
The smallest adult cat ever recorded was a Himalayan Colorpoint Persian. Named Tinkertoy, this tiny runt of the litter was under 3 inches tall and was less than 8 inches long.
Himalayan and Colorpoint Persian cats are among the world's most popular pedigreed cats. The Persian is the most popular breed, and Himalayan is considered to be the most popular Persian color variant.
The Himalayan cat is not named after the Himalayan mountain range, and it does not come from the Himalayan region. Instead, it is named after the Himalayan rabbit, which shares its beautiful color-pointed coat.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The Himalayan, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed Himalayan or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase a Himalayan, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
Himalayan cats cost between $200-$3,000.
Himalayan cats tend to be medium in size. A fully grown Himalayan cat might weigh between 7-12 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 12"-14" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for Himalayan is 12-15 years.
Himalayan are long-haired cats, so you do have to expect a certain amount of shedding from this breed, but they don't shed as much as other cat breeds.
Okay
I love my little Himalayan kitty she is 2 hrs old weighs only 8 pounds but she throws up any wet food we give her 🙁 any tips?
Assuming you mean two years, not two hours! Does she not throw up dry food? I would advise considering which proteins are in the wet food you’re giving. There’s a chance that she’s having a reaction to something in the food, not the type of food altogether. Additionally, you may want to think about a slower transition to any new foods. Rapidly switching from a familiar dry food to a new wet product could be a shock to the system, and it’s usually recommended that cats slowly transition from diet to diet. Hope this help!
My Himalayan was the sweetest most perfect cat in the word. She loved petting, but when you stopped petting her, she would just lie down next to you and purr.  Other cats I’ve had would head butt you or use some other way to try to get you to continue petting them, not my Aphrodite.  I’ve never owned another cat that was nearly as sweet. I wish I could afford to get another one .
Aphrodite sounds like an absolute gem! Thanks for sharing, Bobbi!

One of the oldest and most recognizable cat breeds, the Himalayan is part of the Persian Breed Group, which also includes the Persian and Exotic Shorthair breeds. They share the same body type, but the Exotic Shorthair’s short coarse hair differs from the massive hair of the Persian and Himalayan. Known for their sweet, flat face, large, round eyes and fat cheeks, they get along with everyone. Find out more about this breed and if a Himalayan is right for you and your family.
Gentle
As with all cats in the Persian Breed Group, Himalayans are medium sized, but appear larger than they really are due to their massive fur. Males are larger than females.
The Himalayan is a very healthy breed and can be expected to live between 8-11 years.
All color pointed cats (a light colored body with darker points and blue eyes) with Persian type are called Himalayan. Possible pointed colors include: red, cream, seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, tortoiseshell, and blue-cream. Himalayans also appear in a variety of pointed patterns, including solid point, tortoiseshell, bicolor point, tricolor point, tabby or lynx point, smoke and shaded point.

Gentle and quiet, Himalayan cats prefer being in a calm environment. They are very easygoing and prefer lounging on a sofa with their families. Himalayans communicate with their expressive eyes and his soft, harmonious voice. They are an adaptable breed and will enjoy living with any family as long as they love them and treat them gently.
The ideal Himalayan breed is a strong cat with excellent boning and musculature, a well-balanced cat, giving the impression of robust power. The face should be round with a sweet, pleasant expression and large, round expressive eyes. The cat should be well-balanced physically and temperamentally, gentle and amenable to handling.
As with all members of the Persian Breed Group, Himalayans are placid and exhibit bursts of kitten-like activity. They will be sleeping in the sun one minute and suddenly explode into action, running through the room and rolling around. Himalayans like to play with interactive toys, chase balls, and catnip mice, but you might have to keep after them to exercise on a daily basis.
Himalayans will stretch out next to you, sleep in your bed, and sit on your lap when they are in the mood. They do not mind changes in routine and are generally friendly with everyone.

The Persian breed is one of the oldest cat breeds and can been seen depicted in hieroglyphics as early as 1684 B.C.
Persian breeds made their American debut in the early 19th century.
The Himalayan is a gorgeous cat with the body and coat of a Persian but the color, pattern and stunning dark blue eyes of the Siamese. A man-made breed, it is named for the pointed pattern that is known as Himalayan in many other breeds. It is one of the most popular breeds and comes in a wide array of pointed colors.
Virginia Cobb and Dr. Clyde Keeler began an experimental breeding program in 1931 and produced the first Himalayan kitten named “Newton’s Debutante” In the 1950’s in Canada Ben Borrett began working on a similar breeding program to create a longhair colorpoint cat. In 1955 GCCF recognized the Himalayan as a Colorpoint Longhair. Marguerita Goforth received permission from a friend to use a longhaired cat with seal point coloring, named “Princess Himalayan Hope, ” to begin her breeding program to create a Persian type cat with Siamese markings. She was a major pioneer in getting the Himalayan recognized for Championship and American associations recognized the breed in 1957 as the Himalayan.
The Himalayan is a poised, loving and sweet breed. It is a sedate and affectionate cat, that prefers to cuddle with you rather than climb up your curtains. The Himalayan is responsive to your moods and emotions. They are very intelligent. Some breeders say Himalayans tend to talk more, but nothing like the Siamese. They love to be petted but do not demand attention like some breeds. But if they are not getting enough attention they will let you know with their quiet meows and meaningful looks from their big blue eyes. They also love to play with toys whether it is the most expensive toy or a balled up scrap of paper.
The Himalayan is a medium to large cat with a short cobby body that is equally massive across the shoulders and rump. The head is large, round, and smoothed domed with great breadth of skull that is set on a short, thick neck. They must have perfect tooth occlusion and a strong, well developed chin. The boning should be heavy. The eyes are large, round and set far apart, giving the cat a sweet expression. The nose is short, snub and broad with a break centered between the eyes. The ears are small and rounded at the tip and set far apart and low on the head. Tail should be short and thick, but in proportion to the body. The Himalayan is solid, but not fat, with an overall appearance of soft roundness. The coat is long and flowing and requires constant grooming because of the undercoat that will mat if not groomed. This is a cat that demands a serious time commitment to keep the coat looking lovely and it takes knowledge and practice to do it properly.
The points consisting of the ears, legs, feet, tail and face mask should show the basic color of the cat. The body color should be uniform in color, but subtle shading and darker shaded areas on the coats of older cats is allowed, but there still must be a definite contrast between body color and point color. The Himalayan is accepted in TICA in all colors and divisions.
Owners of Persians, Himalayans and Exotic Shorthair breeds should check with their breeder and veterinarian to ensure their cat has been checked for the following: Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), respiratory problems, eye problems, such as Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.
The Himalayan coat requires daily attention. Cats must be brushed and combed in order to keep the coat from tangling. In addition, the flat face must be cleaned regularly and carefully as tearstains can be deposited on the face.
Nails should be trimmed more frequently (once a week) when they are kittens and less frequently (every 2-3 weeks) as an adult. As with any cat, regularly brushing teeth is recommended. Talk to your vet for instructions and suggestions.
Similar to any cat, the Persians and those in the Persian Group need proper protein and nutrients. A high-quality diet is recommended. After altering (spaying/neutering), they have a greater tendency to become overweight, as with any cat. Owners should be aware of both the quality and quantity of foods being fed.
Fresh water should be available at all times. Water bowls should be washed and refilled with fresh water daily. As with all cats, it is important to give your cat fresh, clean water daily so they don’t hesitate to drink. If you worry about your cat drinking enough water each day, here’s a tip from some cat behaviorists: place the water bowl at least three feet away from any food. Cats’ noses are sensitive and an overwhelming smell of food may cause them to drink less. Many Persians do better with water fountains. It helps keep the hair on their chin and chest drier.

The beautiful, fluffy Himalayan is a mix of the Persian and the Siamese breeds, which shouldn’t come as any surprise, given their level of fluffiness and coloring. The origins of Himalayan cats (Himmies) were in 1931 in the U.S. and continued during the 1950s in England and Canada. These cats certainly have interesting beginnings!
Himmies are medium to large, although their copious amounts of fur can undoubtedly give the impression of them being larger than they actually are. They have flat faces with enormous round blue eyes and come in pointed colors, which include cream, blue, red, chocolate, lilac, seal, and blue cream. They also come in several pointed patterns, such as tortoiseshell, solid, bicolor, tricolor, tabby, lynx, shaded, and smoke.

Himalayans are laidback cats that aren’t overly energetic, and while they are generally healthy, they are prone to several health concerns. They have an average lifespan, depending on the cat, and while they aren’t that trainable, they are friendly cats.


Himalayans are sweet, friendly, and loving cats that bond quite closely with their families. They are also calm and gentle and generally do best in quieter households. They are picky about whom they want to spend most of their time with.
They are intelligent cats and due to their Siamese background, will enjoy having long conversations with you. They love attention, but they won’t go out of their way to pester you for it.
They do make wonderful family cats but not in a big noisy home full of young children. They do better in calmer households, so older children would be ideal. Always teach your children when it’s okay to play with the cat and when they need to let your Himmie sleep.
Himalayans do just fine with other pets, as long as they are not too boisterous. Himmies will enjoy cuddling up with another cat or even a dog but won’t spend too much time playing with another animal. Just make sure the other cat or dog also tends to be calm, or at least give your Himalayan a place to escape to if things become overwhelming.

It’s important to be prepared to own any pet before you bring one home. The Himalayan cat is no exception. Here is more information that can help you understand part of what goes into owning one of these beautiful cats.
There are a few considerations that you need to make regarding the Himalayan cat’s diet. You might be surprised to learn that there is cat food designed for Persians, which will work just as well for a Himalayan. They are prone to hairballs, and their flat faces can make eating more of a challenge, which food like this can help with.
You should also add canned food for the extra moisture content. As cats start to age, they are prone to kidney disease, and canned food, as well as a cat fountain, can help with this. You should also consider placing your cat’s water source at a minimum of 3 feet away from their food. This will help encourage them to drink more.
Since Himmies are not that energetic, you need to be aware of their propensity for weight gain, so keep an eye on food and treat intake. Speak with your vet about any concerns that you may have.
Himalayans are not big fans of exercise. They spend most of their time napping, with the occasional burst of activity. They do play, just not that often, and you should keep in mind that they generally do better as indoor cats only.
You’ll want to make a point of playing with your Himmie every day to help your cat avoid weight gain. Put up cat shelves and a cat tree, and ensure that they have plenty of enrichment and interactive toys.
Himalayans can be trained because they are smart enough, but whether they want to bother with training is another story. Short training sessions work best, and you can train your Himalayan to walk on a harness and leash, but they’re perfectly happy to be indoor cats.
Owning a Himalayan also means maintaining that coat. They have thick double coats of fur that need to be brushed every day. They are also prone to eye discharge, so you’ll need to regularly clean the tearstains from their face.
You’ll want to trim your cat’s nails about every 3–4 weeks, and you’ll need to invest in a cat scratcher. Cats should have their teeth brushed regularly but if it doesn’t go well, consider giving your Himmie dental treats instead.
The Himalayan is prone to several health conditions, so you’ll want to speak to your breeder about any questions that you have regarding your cat’s health.
Himalayans are also prone to watery eyes and are sensitive to heat.

One of the main differences between male and female Himalayans is size. The males tend to be a little larger and heavier than the females.
Spaying or neutering your Himmie will help prevent unwanted behaviors like spraying and running away (or constantly trying to run away). Spaying will cost extra.
If you’re trying to decide between a male and a female because you’re looking for a specific temperament, you’re much better off just meeting the kittens (or adults) and going from there.
How well you connect with the cat is what you should go by when making your decision. In the long run, how the kitten is raised in your home will determine your Himmie’s personality.
The Himalayan is thought to be a separate and distinct breed by associations such as TICA and the American Cat Fanciers Association. However, the Cat Fanciers Association believes that the Himalayan is a variety of Persian.
Colonel Meow was a Himalayan from Los Angeles and broke the record in 2014 for having the world’s longest fur (9 inches, actually). Tinker Toy was a Himalayan that broke the record for the world’s smallest cat. He was only 2.75 inches tall and 7.5 inches long and came from Illinois.
Temperament, size, and energy levels are all elements that these two breeds have in common. The only truly noticeable difference between the Himalayan and the Persian is eye and coat color. Himmies always have blue eyes, and they are always color-pointed, whereas Persians are not. Of course, this depends on whether you consider Himalayans to be a variety of Persian.

Finding a Himalayan won’t be difficult, given how popular these cats are. You can search through social media, and you should be able to locate a breeder close to your location. Just remember to be careful when choosing a breeder. They are usually registered through TICA, and you should ask to speak to the other owners who took one of the breeder’s cats home.
Don’t forget to consider adoption. If you don’t find a Himmie at your local rescue group, you might be able to find one through breed-specific organizations, like the Persian & Himalayan Cat Rescue based out of Northern California.
The sweet and gentle Himmie will be the perfect pet if you’re looking for a cat that wants to cuddle and generally hang out with you. If a calm and affectionate cat sounds like the perfect fit for you, take a Himalayan home!
