Cat Breeds
The adorable, personable Exotic Shorthair cat is a cross between the Persian and the American Shorthair. Friendly toward newcomers and affectionate toward family members, these cats adore their people and enjoy nothing quite so much as the attention of their human companions. They are fond of cuddling – so much so, that it's not at all uncommon for them to climb under the covers with their favorite person.
Exotic Shorthair cats are famous for following their family members around the house. If you are sitting in one room and their toys are in another, they may bring a favorite toy into the room where you are and play with it next to your feet.
Speaking of playfulness, Exotic Shorthair cats do enjoy playtime, but they typically play in a gentler, slower manner than the average cat. If you live in a small apartment and don't have room for a huge cat tree, this might be the ideal breed for you!
Exotic Shorthair cats have no special nutritional needs, however they are less active than some other cat breeds and may be prone to obesity. We recommend offering a high-protein diet without too many carbohydrates. Since obesity can lead to numerous health problems, it's very important to feed your cat the proper amount.
Even though these cats have short coats, they require frequent grooming. True, you'll only need to brush them once or twice per week, however you will need to clean the eye area and the folds of the face once or twice per day to prevent irritation. Consider teaching your kitten to accept toothbrushing and nail clipping.
Since it's important to prevent obesity particularly in laid-back cat breeds like the Exotic Shorthair, you'll want to provide fun toys and make yourself available for interactive play.
Since these cats can have some difficulty breathing when they exert themselves, it's important to monitor them for signs of trouble as you’re playing exciting games like "Chase the laser."
Like all cats, Exotic Shorthairs enjoy high vantage points. They'll happily climb to the top of a cat tree, but there's also a good likelihood that they'll be happy with a window seat or a view from a comfy spot on the couch. Do make scratching posts available so that your kitty can stretch and scratch as nature intended.
Just like their Persian cousins, Exotic Shorthair cats do have a couple of known health issues. These include respiratory health problems or difficulty breathing, along with some tear staining. Exotic Shorthair cat's eyes protrude slightly from their faces, increasing the risk of scratches and other eye injuries. This is a common issue in all flat faced cats.
Brachycephalic cats including Persians and Exotic Shorthairs can overheat quickly in hot temperatures. Again, this is an issue caused by the shortened respiratory tract. The best prevention is to keep your cat indoors, at a comfortable temperature.
The Exotic Shorthair is a relatively new cat breed. Sometimes called a Persian in a petticoat, this lovable cat was developed in the 1950s, when cat breeder Carolyn Bussey attempted to create a brown Persian by crossing a Persian cat with a Burmese. Although the resulting kittens were black in color, they were absolutely adorable and Bussey knew that she was on to something.
In 1967, the Cat Fanciers Association granted the Exotic Shorthair championship status. In 1971, CFA's grand champion was an exotic Shorthair and the breed continued to gain popularity.
By 1975, the Exotic Shorthair gene pool was large enough for breeders to stop outcrossing with Burmese and American Shorthairs. Today, all pedigreed Exotic Shorthair cats are the result of pairings between registered Exotic Shorthair parents.
If you think that these cats look like shorthaired Persians, you're right! According to CFA, they meet all Persian breed standards, with the exception of their short coat.
While most Exotic Shorthair cats have very flat faces, some have more prominent noses that give them the nickname “doll face Exotic Shorthair.”
Exotic Shorthair cats are considered to be non-shedding. This description should be taken with a grain of salt since all cats – even so-called hairless breeds do lose hair over time.  If you bring an ExoticShorthair cat into your family, you'll notice far less shedding than you would with the average cat, but you'll still find a few hairs here and there.
Thanks to its relatively low maintenance coat, the Exotic Shorthair is nicknamed the lazy man's Persian.
At Cats.com, we advocate for cat adoption versus buying from breeders.                            The Exotic Shorthair, like other purebred cats, is seldom seen in shelters and rescues.
                            Try out our Petfinder tool to explore cats who are either confirmed Exotic Shorthair or resemble one.                            Remember that many shelters incorrectly label moggies — non-purebred cats — as purebreds.
                            Take a look, and you just might fall in love with a non-purebred rescue cat in need.
                            If you want to purchase an Exotic Shorthair, consider contacting a local breeder for more information.
Exotic Shorthair cats cost between $1,000-$5,000.
Exotic Shorthair cats tend to be small in size. A fully grown Exotic Shorthair cat might weigh between 8-15 pounds or more and range in height anywhere from about 10"-12" inches tall.
The Average lifespan for Exotic Shorthair is 12-16 years.
Exotic Shorthair are short-haired cats. Therefore, they do not shed as much as long-haired cat breeds.

Be prepared to join a waiting list, as these adorable furballs are quite sought after!

Exotic Shorthair cats are an intelligent breed characterized by their serene and affectionate disposition. This breed is known for its sharp cognitive abilities. They are quick learners, showing an ability to understand and adapt to their human’s routine and commands. This intelligence also translates to their playful nature, as they enjoy interactive toys and games that challenge their minds.
But the Exotic Shorthair is not just about play and intelligence. It’s a breed known for its deep loyalty and affection toward its family members. They create a strong bond with their humans, offering immense love and forming an inseparable connection.
They are often found following their owners around the house, quietly observing their activities with a loving gaze. So, if you eventually adopt an Exotic Shorthair, you can expect a loyal companion who stays by your side.
Exotic Shorthair cats are not just good for families; they are exceptional! Their friendly nature and adaptability make them a wonderful addition to households of all sizes. They are patient and gentle, which makes them a fantastic companion for children. At the same time, they are not overly demanding of attention, allowing them to fit seamlessly into the busy schedule of adults.
They are the kind of pets that fill a home with warmth and joy. Their presence has a calming effect, and their antics provide endless entertainment. Despite their serene disposition, they enjoy participating in family activities, making them excellent family pets.
Exotic Shorthair cats are generally great with other pets. Their calm and amiable nature, paired with their non-confrontational attitude, allows them to get along quite well in a multi-pet household. Whether it’s another cat or even a dog, the Exotic Shorthair is usually very accepting.
They are not known to be territorial and can form friendly relationships with other pets over time. However, as with all pet introductions, it’s important to supervise initial interactions to ensure they are positive.
With their tolerant nature and capacity for friendship, Exotic Shorthairs can indeed become a companion for your existing pet, adding to the harmonious dynamic of your home.

An Exotic Shorthair cat requires a balanced diet to maintain its overall health. Since this breed is prone to obesity, it is crucial to monitor their food intake carefully. Ensure that you feed your cat with high-quality cat food, rich in protein and low in carbohydrates, to promote optimal health.
Treats should be given sparingly and should constitute no more than 10% of their total calorie intake. Consult with a veterinarian to establish a suitable feeding schedule and diet plan.
Despite their plush and somewhat lazy appearance, Exotic Shorthairs are moderately active cats. They enjoy interactive play sessions which not only cater to their exercise needs but also provide mental stimulation.
Toys like feather wands, laser pointers, and puzzle feeders can be excellent tools to encourage physical activity. Regular exercise can help prevent obesity and related health issues.
Exotic Shorthairs are intelligent cats, making them generally easy to train. They respond particularly well to positive reinforcement techniques. Be patient and consistent with your training methods. Regularly reward your cat with treats and praise to encourage good behavior. Whether you are toilet training or teaching them tricks, this breed is quick to learn and eager to please.
Exotic Shorthairs have a short, dense coat that is relatively easy to groom. Regular brushing (about once or twice a week) is generally enough to keep their coat looking healthy and shiny. Brushing also helps to minimize shedding and prevent hairballs. Other grooming requirements include regular dental care, nail clipping, and ear cleaning.
Male and female Exotic Shorthairs have similar personality traits, making them both ideal companions. Both genders are known for their placid temperament, friendliness, and affectionate nature. However, it is worth noting that males might be slightly larger than females in terms of size.
Also, keep in mind that the behavior of individual cats may vary, regardless of their gender. Therefore, choose a cat based on its personality and how well it fits with your lifestyle.

The Exotic Shorthair cat has a fascinating backstory that dates to the 1960s. Breeders aiming to enhance the American Shorthair’s body type decided to experiment by crossing it with the luxurious Persian breed.
The outcome was the Exotic Shorthair, which inherited the best of both worlds: the Persian’s plush physicality and the American Shorthair’s robust structure. This breed, although relatively new in the cat world, quickly won hearts with its unique charm and personality, affirming that the breeding experiment was indeed a successful venture.
Due to its remarkable resemblance to the Persian breed but with much simpler grooming requirements, the Exotic Shorthair has earned a playful nickname: the “Lazy Man’s Persian”. This moniker highlights the ease of care that accompanies this breed.
While the Exotic Shorthair displays the captivating appeal of the Persian cat with its plush coat and round, expressive eyes, it does not demand the meticulous grooming that the long-haired Persians require. This distinctive trait makes it a desirable pet for those who are drawn to the Persian breed but are deterred by the prospect of high-maintenance grooming.
In the realm of feline fancy, the Exotic Shorthair made a significant mark in 1991. That year, an Exotic Shorthair cat was crowned the “Cat of the Year” by the Cat Fanciers Association, a prestigious award given annually to an outstanding specimen from one of the recognized breeds.
This was a momentous occasion, as it was the first time an Exotic Shorthair had won this illustrious title. This accolade not only amplified the breed’s popularity but also affirmed the endearing qualities that make it a highly cherished pet among cat lovers.

The Exotic Shorthair is an enchanting blend of charm, playfulness, and loyalty. Their low-maintenance grooming needs, coupled with their loving and gentle nature, make them an excellent choice for any cat lover. If you are seeking a sociable, easy-going companion, this teddy bear-like breed could be the perfect fit for your home.

The Exotic Shorthair cat is such a sweet-faced cat that it is often referred to as the ‘lazy man’s Persian. This is because the face is also flat and pushed in like the Persian cat.
The Exotic Shorthair was in fact developed as a short-haired version of the Persian. It was in the 1950s that the Persian was used to mate with other breeds such as the Burmese.
The crossbreed gained recognition but some American Shorthair breeders produced a new breed standard that would disqualify American Shorthairs that showed any signs of crossbreeding.
It was in 1966 that the Cat Fanciers Association recognized the cat as a new breed and under the name Exotic Shorthair.
Developed through crosses between Persians and American Shorthairs as well as other cat breeds, the Exotic Shorthair looks like the Persian but he has a short coat.
The coat is found in the same colors as the Persian cat – patterns and solid colors, ranging from chinchilla silver to tabby, tortoiseshell, black and white and bicolor. The eyes are large and round, the ears small and round and the tail fairly short and thick.
The Exotic Shorthair is a sweet, gentle, calm cat but a bit livelier than the Persian. They’re lively, friendly, and playful, but are also cats that like to sit in your lap and be stroked.
They get on well with children and other pets, being a loyal friend to the entire family. He quietly communicates with his human family with a soft voice. He is also quite adaptable to living conditions so long as his human family provides him with lots of attention.
He won’t want to be left for long periods of time on his own so he won’t suit living in a home where he is left alone all day.
Your Exotic Shorthair is a loving cat and for those who prefer, it is a cat that is livelier than the Persian. While the Exotic Shorthair also has a mellow personality, because of its shorthair ancestors, it's more active.
This Exotic cat can live to be 15, 16, or 17 if you care for him well and that means you have 15 years to share with a most wonderful feline companion.
With the Exotic Shorthair, some of the diseases are genetic while others can be encouraged by poor diet and lifestyle.
Obesity for instance is a major disease of cats and it contributes to many serious illnesses in cats. Excess weight shortens your cat’s life and contributes to arthritis and diabetes. The extra weight puts a strain on the cat's joints. Shedding just a little bit of weight can result in improved mobility.
Dental disease is a common chronic problem in pets. Make sure to check inside your cat’s mouth from time to time as serious dental problems can cause pain and interfere with the health of your cat’s important organs such as heart and kidneys.
All kinds of parasites can invade your Exotic Shorthair's body, internally and externally – worms, fleas, and ticks - and cause your pet a tremendous amount of pain and discomfort.
Brachycephalic Syndrome is a respiratory distress syndrome and it mostly affects what is known as brachycephalic cats – those cat with snub faces like the Exotic Shorthair.
The flattened features of the face make it that there is less space for the tissue to grow. The soft area at the back of the roof of the mouth hangs into the airway, obstructing it, and they can’t breathe normally. Sometimes the cats will require surgery to allow for more regular breathing.
It is important to understand the type of foods available to your pet and how often and how much to feed him.
Most cats prefer to eat several small meals a day as opposed to a couple of large ones. Make feed times interesting and provide food puzzles to have your cat ‘prey’ for food.
Always read and understand the labels on the cat food packaging and be sure to always feed your Exotic Shorthair with the very best food there is and to follow the portion guides.
If you’re in any doubt or your cat doesn’t want to eat his food, try something else or speak to your vet about how to be sure your cat is getting fed the best food there is.
Make sure to have your kitten vaccinated as required. Also, when you take your kitten in to be vaccinated, the vet will also perform a check-up to make sure your kitten is healthy as these cats are susceptible to bacterial and viral infections.
Your cat has a short, low maintenance coat. A brush once a week can get rid of loose hairs and you and your cat will both enjoy the therapeutic bonding between the two of you.
Check your cat’s inner ears for wax and debris as well as for signs of any infection, and if you don’t want to do that, professional cat groomers can do it for you.

One of the oldest and most recognizable cat breeds, the Exotic Shorthair is part of the Persian Breed Group, which also includes the Persian and Himalayan breeds. They share the same body type, but the Exotic Shorthair’s short coarse hair differs from massive hair of the Persian and Himalayan. Known for their sweet, flat face, large, round eyes and fat cheeks, they get along with everyone. Find out more about this breed and if an Exotic Shorthair is right for you and your family.
Gentle
As with all cats in the Persian Breed Group, Exotic Shorthairs are medium sized, but appear larger than they really are due to their dense fur. Males are larger than females.
The Exotic Shorthair is a very healthy breed and can be expected to live between 8-11 years.
White, red, cream, black, blue, chocolate, lilac, silver, golden, tortoiseshell, blue-cream, brown, calico, and seal. Exotic Shorthairs also appear in a variety of patterns, including tortoiseshell, bicolor, tricolor, tabby, smoke, shaded, and Himalayan (a light colored body with darker points, and blue eyes).

The gentle Exotic Shorthair is a Persian in its pajamas and is the ideal cat for those who love the look of the Persian but do not have the time or inclination to take care of all that hair. Sometimes called ‘the lazy man’s Persian’, the Exotic Shorthair is bred to be just like the Persian-except with a short, dense coat instead of a long flowing one. Exotics have the same pansy-like sweet face and short nose with big eyes and the same short square body giving them a cuddly bear-like look. These affectionate cats have the quiet manners of the Persian but are livelier and more inquisitive thanks to their shorthaired ancestry.
The Exotic Shorthair grew from a different original desire. American Shorthair breeders bred to Persians to obtain their lovely silver color and green eyes. The kittens were pretty to look at but did not meet the true American Shorthair type. Jane Martinke noticed the effect the outcrosses had on the American type and coat as well as the attractiveness of the kittens. She proposed a new breed, called the Sterling because of their lovely silver color. These new cats were to look just like Persians but with a short, dense plush coat. Originally intended to be silver only, the new breed changed the name to Exotic Shorthair and accepted all colors. Only a few outcrosses were made to shorthaired but because the gene is dominant. In addition to the American Shorthair, some breeders chose to use the Burmese for its stocky body type, moderate head and short coat, while others went to the Russian Blue for the shorthaired gene because of its dense double coat. After the initial outcross to get the short coat, the offspring were bred back to Persians. At about the same time, Carolyn Bussey (New Dawn) crossed a Burmese and a red tabby Persian in an attempt to create a brown Persian. Brown is recessive so all the kittens were black and Carolyn also got the idea to develop a short-coated Persian.
Early progress was slow and difficult as Exotic Shorthair breeders tried to get Persian breeders to work with them. Gradually as the type on the new breed improved and it became more popular, an increasing number of Persian breeders were willing to help and some decided to work with the young breed as well. The goal was to produce a short-coated Persian so as Persian type changed so did Exotic Shorthair type. The early standard did not call for the Exotic to have a break like the Persian because of its shorthaired ancestry, however as the type came ever closer to the Persian this changed and the standards are now identical except for coat length. They have had championship recognition in TICA since June 1979.
The easy-going Exotic Shorthair is an affectionate, gentle cat with the quiet manners of the Persian. Quietly endearing, Exotics request your attention with an irresistible gaze and then hug you when you pick them up. They will follow you from room to room in order to be near you and then jump in your lap for a nap when you settle down to read a book. Their shorthaired ancestors have given them a love of play and they will jump to catch a toy or sit studying how to get the toy you put out of reach before they were finished playing. Simple things amuse them whether it is chasing paper balls around the house or watching water drip out of a tap. While seen but rarely heard, the Exotic has a soft voice and has a vocabulary of chirping sounds. Although sweet and peaceful, Exotics still have an intelligent curiosity that makes them a joy to be around and since they are so easy-going they get on well with children and other pets.
Grooming is easy with simple combing removing loose dead hair and a wipe of the eyes that can get irritated by dust because of their large surface. All the look of a Persian without the need to care for the long coat!

Exotic Shorthair cats are essentially the same cat breed as Persian cats, except the other has short fur. Despite its lack of fluff, the Exotic Shorthair makes up for it with a loving personality, calm demeanor, and a surprisingly playful side that the Persian sometimes lacks. Find out why so many people love Exotics and why you should consider getting one today!


The Exotic Shorthair is a relatively new breed. Their parent breed, the Persian, is far more ancient, dating back to around 1684 B.C. Over time, Persian cats spread throughout Europe in the 1800s, becoming favorites amongst the royalty and wealthy. Breeders decided to start mixing Persians with American Shorthairs in the late 1950s, giving American Shorthairs a heavier, rounder appearance with the Persian's signature short nose.

Once considered a hybrid between the Persian and American Shorthair, the Exotic Shorthair has now been deemed a breed all its own. Breeder and Cat Fanciers' Association judge Jane Martinke is often credited with continuing the breeder's efforts, helping the breed become recognized by the CFA in 1967.

Within just a few years, an Exotic Shorthair kitten achieved grand champion status in 1971. By this time, the breed had gained quite a following already. By 1987, the CFA didn't allow any outcrosses or outbreeding to the Exotic Shorthair except for Persians to keep the breed pure. Today, they are considered one of the most popular short-haired cat breeds.


This short haired cat loves being around their family, especially whichever human they deem their favorite. They'll quietly follow them from room to room, piquing their curiosity about whatever activity is going on. Exotic Shorthairs also love cuddles! They are a breed that will curl up on your lap, lick you, and ask to be carried — anything to be with you.


Despite being very social, Exotics aren't too demanding. They'll cuddle and hang out with you when called, but they won't be too clingy or in-your-face about needing attention. They are also known for being very quiet. They're not a vocal cat, and the CFA states that their voices are "seldom heard."


While they are more playful than the Persian, they're still a bit of a lug. During random bursts of energy, the Exotic will show off, chasing after a toy or jumping after a ribbon until they're exhausted. Sometimes they'll even dig around for the toy after you put it away, hoping to continue their play session.

Other times, they prefer to sit back and watch the toy move, swatting at it here and there. They love a good playtime, but you won't find the Exotic Shorthair energetically zooming around the house, looking for things to get into like more active breeds.

Like the Persian, the Exotic Shorthair is a medium-sized breed with an uncharacteristically large head. In fact, their head may appear even larger since they don't have the excessive fluff to fill out the rest of their body. The Exotic's facial features are like their long-haired counterparts with a flat, snubbed nose and big, friendly eyes.


The Exotic Shorthair weighs around 12 pounds and can reach up to 15 inches tall. Even without the fur, the Exotic Shorthair's body is round and heavily boned with a broad, deep chest, big shoulders, and a good-sized rump.


Their "round and massive" head is known around the world for its prominent eyes and flat nose. Their chunky head sits atop a short, thick neck.


The Exotic Shorthair's eyes are described as "brilliant in color" by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Just like the Persian cat, their eye color will often correlate with their coat pattern. White Exotic Shorthairs will have dark blue eyes, and other patterns will have a brilliant copper color.


The Exotic Shorthair has short legs that are thick and strong in appearance. Their paws are large and round to match, five toes carried close in the front and four on the back legs.


Much like the Persian, the Exotic Shorthair can come in a large assortment of colors and coat patterns. Here's a closer look at some of the divisions recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association:

Families often choose Exotic pet cats because they still have the distinct facial characteristics and lovable personality of a Persian without the need for extensive daily brushing. Some people call Exotics the "Lazy Man's Persian" because they require far less brushing, at around once a week. Still, regular grooming helps avoid excessive shedding and hairballs.

What hasn't changed, though, is their unique face. Their flat nose and big eyes bring on some challenges of their own, even without fur. Exotic Shorthair kittens will often get a discharge in the folds of their face, making them appear dirty. You can use vet-approved wipes or warm, soft cloths to wipe the tears and dirt away.

You should usually keep Exotic Shorthair indoors. Since their snubbed nose makes it harder to breathe, they cannot run as long or as fast as most cats. This makes them susceptible to predators, strays, dogs, and cars. Make sure your Exotic also has a shallow cat bowl to accommodate for their facial structure as well.


Although most Exotic Shorthairs are pretty healthy, these adorable felines don't come without a few hereditary health issues. Remember always to take your cat to the vet for regular checkups! Here are some conditions owners should be aware of:




Another common illness for Exotic Shorthairs is feline polycystic kidney disease. PKD is a life-altering, inherited condition that can lead to kidney failure. Kittens affected by PKD start to develop cysts on their kidneys at just a few weeks of age. Symptoms will often appear before six months of age. It's imperative to only buy an Exotic Shorthair from a trusted, responsible breeder who knows the litter's health history.


Exotic Shorthairs also love to eat. However, their love for food can often lead to obesity, which can cause many health problems for a stockier breed like the Exotic Shorthair. You can implement an automatic feeder that gives your cat the exact recommended amount over time. This way, your Exotic stays fed all day long without running the risk of overfeeding.

You should also consider the ingredients of the food you provide your kitty with. Look for foods with a named protein source as the first ingredient and as few carbohydrate fillers as possible. You can also feed them wet food, which is often considered healthier and provides more water for your cat.


Exotic Shorthairs are peaceful companions. They are very tolerant of other pets and children, usually not showing any aggression or hostility. Laidback exotic cats as pets can learn to live with other pets with almost no problems. Children also love to play with Exotic Shorthairs since they are playful yet very gentle and easygoing.

You can supervise your cat's interactions with younger children to teach kids how to be gentle and kind to pets. Like most cats, Exotic Shorthairs still love their alone time. Ensure your Exotic Shorthair has its own space at home, like a cat tree or cat shelf. Having a refuge will let an older Exotic relax, away from kittens and kids when needed.

Exotic Shorthair kittens can be quite expensive, ranging from about $1,500 to $2,500. According to the Cat Fanciers' Association, many breeders get requests for female kittens because they believe they're sweeter and more loving. However, this isn't true at all! The CFA actually says that male kittens are often more affectionate than females, while females are considered more aloof.

An Exotic Shorthair named Calico plays the evil villain's sidekick in Cats & Dogs and its sequel. Winston on the sitcom New Girl also owns an Exotic Shorthair named Ferguson, a prevalent character on the show. Pudge the Cat and Snoopy are two other famous cats of this breed who have made a name for themselves on social media.


The Exotic Shorthair is a delightful blend of the Persian’s charm and the practicality of a short-haired coat, making it an ideal choice for cat lovers seeking a low-maintenance yet affectionate feline companion. With their loving personality, playful yet calm demeanor, and striking appearance, Exotic Shorthairs are perfect for families, singles, and seniors alike.
